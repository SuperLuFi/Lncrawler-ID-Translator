Chapter 1301
In the vast starry sky, Ye Xuan flew on his sword with Ye Zhiming by his side.
Ye Zhiming looked at the distant starry sky, thinking about something.
Ye Xuan suddenly smiled, "Zhiming, you seem to be very familiar with the Underworld!"
Ye Zhiming glanced at Ye Xuan and snorted, "You want to know my true identity!"
Ye Xuan nodded, "I am indeed curious!"
Ye Zhiming remained expressionless and did not speak.
Seeing that Ye Zhiming did not say anything, Ye Xuan did not ask further and slowly closed his eyes.
Calm down and focus!
He estimated that with his current strength, he should be able to fight a true Dao Proving expert head-on!
Of course, he did not have the confidence to win.
Dao Confirming expert!
He did not dare to underestimate such an expert!
At this time, Ye Zhiming suddenly said, "You have now integrated the Fifth Dimension, Sixth Dimension, Godly Kingdom of Xumi, and Western Paradise. In addition, you are willing to share the Dao Scripture. In time, your strength will not be weaker than the Underworld!"
Sharing the Dao Scripture!
It could be said that Ye Xuan was currently using his own strength to increase the overall strength of the major forces!
For Ye Xuan, as long as he had a little more time, there would be many super experts appearing on his side!
For people like Aro and Jiu, once they reach the true Release Realm, they would definitely have the ability to fight against Dao Confirming experts.
Ye Xuan smiled, "The Underworld will not give me that much time!"
Ye Zhiming nodded, whispering, "Indeed!"
Ye Xuan asked again, "Zhiming, is Sansheng really just a stone?"
Ye Zhiming nodded, "She is a stone, but not an ordinary stone. She is called a Dao Stone. It can be said that she is as special as the Dao Scripture."
Ye Xuan asked, "Do you know where she came from?"
Ye Zhiming nodded, "I know a little about Dao Yi."
Ye Xuan quickly asked, "Can you tell me?"
Ye Zhiming said indifferently, "Ask her yourself!"
Ye Xuan shook his head, "She is not willing to say!"
Ye Zhiming said, "Then all the more I can't say!"
Ye Xuan was speechless.
As he spoke, Ye Xuan suddenly realized that his surroundings had begun to change!
Ye Zhiming said, "We're here!"
As she spoke, she and Ye Xuan had already entered a wasteland. At the end of the wasteland, it was pitch black.
Ye Xuan looked at the pitch-black land. "Is that the underworld over there?"
Ye Zhiming nodded with a solemn look in his eyes. "Yes, as long as the people of the Yang Realm step into that place, their bodies will be corroded."
Ye Xuan nodded his head. He brought Ye Xuan to the pitch-black land, and before them, Ye Xuan discovered a red line imprinted on the ground, stretching to both sides without an end.
To the left of the red line was the world of the living, and to the right was the world of the dead!
Ye Zhiming pointed at the line, "This is the Dao Realm. It was placed here by an almighty to separate the underworld from the Yang Realm!"
As she said this, she suddenly glared at Ye Xuan, "Don't ask me who that almighty is. I don't know!"
Ye Xuan, "…"
Ye Zhiming looked at the Dao Realm, "Actually, a long time ago, this barrier was extremely powerful, so powerful that even Dao Validation experts didn't dare to approach it. But now … its power is far from what it used to be!"
As she said this, there was a trace of complexity in her eyes.
Great Dao!
In fact, many Great Daos in the world had been reversed, and the various orders of heaven and earth had been in chaos a long time ago!
The current order was completely different from the past.
Ye Xuan suddenly said, "If we want to go over, we have to deal with the Dao Realm first?"
Ye Zhiming nodded, "We can't let its Dao Law force your body. This way, after you enter the Yang Realm, your body won't be corroded.
Of course, even without the Dao Law, your body might not be corroded! "
She didn't forget that Ye Xuan had the Death Realm!
Ye Xuan quickly said, "Then, shall we go in?"
Ye Zhiming expressionlessly said, "You go!"
Ye Xuan blinked his eyes, "Is there any problem?"
Ye Zhiming said, "If you dare to cross this line, the Dao Law contained in the Dao Realm will attack you. You might be able to withstand it now, but in this way, it will cause a huge commotion and be discovered by the Yang Realm."
Ye Xuan said solemnly, "In other words, we can only sneak over?"
Ye Zhiming nodded, "Yes!"
Ye Xuan smiled, "Zhiming, do you have a way?"
Ye Zhiming said after a moment of silence, "You can try using your sword domain!"
Sword domain!
Ye Xuan nodded. He walked to the Dao Realm and displayed his sword domain. When the sword domain enveloped the Dao Realm, his face instantly turned pale. He quickly retracted the sword domain and looked at Ye Zhiming, "This …"
Ye Zhiming said solemnly, "No, your sword domain can't withstand the power of the Dao Realm!"
Ye Xuan frowned, "Then what should I do?"
Ye Zhiming looked at the Dao Realm for a long time, then said, "You can try communicating with it!"
Ye Xuan blinked, "You mean it has a spirit?"
Ye Zhiming nodded, "Yes!
But I think it might ignore you! "
Ye Xuan was puzzled, "Why?"
Ye Zhiming said indifferently, "You're not strong enough!"
Ye Xuan's lips curled, "I have a way!"
Ye Zhiming looked at Ye Xuan and saw Ye Xuan taking out a sword, the sword of the azure-robed man.
The Sword Spirit!
Ye Xuan walked over to the Dao Realm with the Sword Spirit in his hand, and then he lightly tapped the Dao Realm with the sword.
Bang!
A powerful force suddenly shook Ye Xuan to the point he was pushed back repeatedly!
Ye Xuan glanced at the sword after he stopped, and he was slightly puzzled. Is the azure-robed man's reputation useless?
Suddenly, the Dao Realm trembled slightly, and then a ray of red light floated out from within it. A little girl suddenly appeared within the red light.
The little girl was around 15 or 16 years old, and she was slightly taller than Ye Zhiming. She wore a red dress, and her features were picturesque. Even though she was young, she was devastatingly beautiful.
The spirit of the Dao Realm!
Ye Zhiming glanced at Ye Xuan. This fellow actually managed to get the spirit of the Dao Realm out!
He was a f * cking genius!
The little girl stared fixedly at Ye Xuan, "You're not the owner of this sword!"
Ye Xuan nodded, "Yes!"
The little girl suddenly took a step forward, and she instantly appeared in front of Ye Xuan. She just stared at Ye Xuan, "Where's the owner of this sword?"
Ye Xuan's eyelids twitched, "He's not here!"
The little girl flared up with rage, "He's not here!
Are you kidding me? "
As soon as she finished speaking, she suddenly smashed her fist forward.
Ye Xuan's expression changed drastically, and he raised his sword to block.
Bang!
Ye Xuan instantly retreated thousands of feet away. As soon as he stopped, the flesh in front of his chest directly split open, and a powerful force crazily destroyed his flesh!
Ye Xuan was shocked, and he hurriedly activated the Sword Domain to suppress that mysterious force!
Meanwhile, the little girl appeared in front of him again, and she was just about to attack when Ye Xuan hurriedly said, "I'll call him out to beat you up if you attack again!"
The little girl just stared at Ye Xuan and didn't speak.
Suddenly, the little girl said, "Who's behind you?"
Ye Xuan instinctively turned his head, but the back of his head was completely empty. Ye Xuan's expression instantly changed drastically when he witnessed this scene, and he cried out in his heart, Shit! He hurriedly turned around. Meanwhile, the little girl's fist smashed against his stomach.
Bang!
Ye Xuan instantly flew over 3km away. At this moment, the space he passed through collapsed layer by layer, and the space in an area of 3km in front of the little girl was instantly transformed into nothingness.
After Ye Xuan stopped moving, he spat out a few mouthfuls of Blood Essence in succession. Moreover, his body was in a horrible state. It had cracked like a spider web, and it seemed like his body would fall apart at any moment!
Ye Xuan wiped off the blood on the corners of his mouth, and then he gazed at the little girl and spoke furiously, "You played dirty!"
Dammit!
He'd really never imagined that this fellow would play dirty!
This little girl possesses such terrifying strength, so how could he have imagined that she would play dirty?
Where's the demeanor of an expert?
The little girl clapped her hands, and then she glanced coldly at Ye Xuan, "It's one thing for the underworld to be restless!
Your world of the living is starting to be restless as well!
It's so annoying! "
With that, she was about to attack again.
At this moment, Ye Xuan suddenly pressed his palms together, and in an instant, a destructive force suddenly gathered within his body.
Ye Zhiming's eyelids twitched at the sight of this.
Dao scripture martial arts!
Just then, the little girl stopped, and she looked at Ye Xuan with a slight frown, "What move is that?
It looks like it's quite powerful! "
Ye Xuan stared at the little girl, "It's a martial art I created myself. Do you want to give it a try?"
Self-created!
The corners of Ye Zhiming's mouth twitched. My god, how dare he say that!
Self-created!
He's really too shameless!
The little girl looked at Ye Xuan, "You created it yourself?"
Ye Xuan nodded, "Yes!"
The little girl thought for a moment, and then she said, "Don't use that move for now. We can talk about it!"
Ye Xuan, "…"
The little girl glanced at the sword in Ye Xuan's hand, and then she said, "Can you tell me where the owner of this sword is?"
Ye Xuan spoke in a low voice, "In a very distant place!"
The little girl asked again, "Are you very familiar with him?"
Ye Xuan thought for a moment, and then he said, "He's my big brother!"
Ye Zhiming, "…"
The little girl frowned slightly, "Then why is he so strong, and you so weak?"
The corners of Ye Xuan's mouth twitched, "Am I weak?"
The little girl looked at Ye Xuan, "Aren't you?"
Ye Xuan spoke indifferently, "Just tell me what you want!"
The little girl thought for a moment, and then she said, "How about this, help me call the owner of this sword over, and then ask him to do me a favor!"
Ye Xuan laughed coldly, "Why should I?"
The little girl looked at Ye Xuan, and she didn't say anything, but her hands were clenched tightly without her knowing.
Ye Xuan wasn't afraid, and he formed a seal with both hands, and the power emanating from his body grew stronger and stronger.
A battle was about to break out!
Ye Xuan suddenly said, "What do you want him to help you with?"
The little girl said indifferently, "Help me cut off something from my body."
Ye Xuan asked, "What is it?"
The little girl looked at Ye Xuan, and she was a little displeased, "Why are you asking so many questions?"
Ye Xuan thought for a moment, and then he said, "Why don't we make a deal?"
The little girl frowned slightly, "A deal?"
Ye Xuan nodded, "I'll help you find that Swordsman, what do you think?"
The little girl looked at Ye Xuan, "What do you want!"
Ye Xuan said seriously, "I don't want anything!"
The little girl frowned slightly, "What do you mean?"
Ye Xuan said seriously, "To be able to help the legendary Great Dao is my, Ye Xuan's, honor, how can I ask for anything else?
No, I don't want anything in return, really! "
The corner of Ye Zhiming's mouth twitched …
The little girl looked at Ye Xuan, and the hostility in her eyes suddenly lessened, "You're more pleasing to the eye than those guys from the Underworld …"
As she said that, she flicked her finger, and a white jade bottle fell in front of Ye Xuan, "Heal your injuries first!"
Ye Zhiming, "…"
.....









Chapter 1302
Ye Xuan took the white jade bottle. There was a white elixir in it. The elixir was smooth and round, and it gave off a refreshing medicinal fragrance.
He didn't suspect anything and swallowed it.
The other party might have a chance to kill him, but it was impossible for them to poison him.
As soon as the pill entered his body, a surge of pure energy quickly spread throughout his body, then into his limbs and bones.
Ye Xuan's body trembled.
So comfortable!
It was a strange feeling!
Ye Zhiming glanced at Ye Xuan. She realized that not only was this guy thick-skinned, he was also good at flattery.
She had to be more careful in the future, or else it would be easy to fall into his trap.
Not long later, Ye Xuan's body returned to normal.
At this time, the young lady suddenly asked, "You want to go to the nether world?"
Ye Xuan nodded, "Senior, to be honest, we are going to the nether world, but I'm a little weak …"
The young lady sized up Ye Xuan, "You're not weak!"
Ye Xuan smiled bitterly, "I couldn't even take two moves from senior!"
The young lady said calmly, "Even in the nether world, not many can take two moves from me. You're already very good!"
Ye Xuan thought for a moment, then said solemnly, "Then it's not that I'm too weak, but senior is too strong!"
Ye Zhiming, "…"
The young lady nodded, "That makes sense!"
Saying so, she glanced at Ye Xuan, "It's said that humans are cunning, but it doesn't seem so. There are still a few honest humans among them."
Ye Zhiming shook her head as she listened.
She suddenly realized a problem. It wasn't without reason that Ye Xuan could reach where he was today.
Thick-Skinned, good at flattery, good at flattery, good at changing the direction of the wind …
Most importantly, this guy was a Swordsman!
Swordsman was all about facing one's heart, but this guy never went against his heart. Not only that, his Sword Dao was getting stronger and stronger!
He was a weirdo!
A super weirdo in the world of Swordsman.
Not far away, the little girl said again, "Tell me about the Swordsman!"
Ye Xuan nodded. "He is my master!"
Master!
The girl sized up Ye Xuan and nodded. "Your attainments in the Sword Dao aren't bad either. It's rare for you to form your own Dao."
Ye Xuan was a little excited, "To be able to obtain Senior's recognition, Junior is overwhelmed by the favor!
If I can get Senior's guidance … "
Give pointers!
The little girl thought about it and felt a little awkward.
Actually, she wasn't skilled in the Sword Dao, but if she didn't give him some pointers at this time, wouldn't she lose face?
The little girl thought for a moment before she said, "Your Sword Dao has formed a Dao of its own. If you want to break through once more, then you must prove your Dao with the sword!"
Proving the Way with the sword!
Ye Xuan blinked. "How do I prove my Dao with the sword?"
The little girl opened her palm, and Ye Xuan's sword appeared in her hand. She held the sword and swung it lightly. In an instant, the space around Ye Xuan was suddenly locked down by a blood red line!
The little girl looked at Ye Xuan. "Try walking out!"
Ye Xuan nodded. He took a step forward, but his body started rotting as soon as he stepped out of the red line!
Ye Xuan was shocked, and he hurriedly retreated. He looked at the little girl. "Senior, what's this?"
The little girl pointed with her fingers, and the sword in her hand landed firmly in front of Ye Xuan. "This is my Dao, the Dao Realm. I am the source of all barriers. If I want to, I can easily seal off this universe."
Ye Xuan fell silent.
Seal off the entire universe!
This little girl is even more terrifying than I've imagined!
The little girl continued, "Your Sword Dao contains variables, but you haven't proven your Dao. No matter how the variables in the world change, they're still the same. You must truly grasp the rules of the Dao of Change, and then prove your Dao with the sword so that your sword can become truly unique!"
Ye Xuan sought guidance humbly. "Prove the Dao with the sword? Is it the Dao with the sword or the Dao with the person?"
The little girl blinked. "Is there a difference?" Ye Xuan was stunned, and then he smiled and said, "I understand!"
There was no difference!
Because he'd already cultivated to the point of becoming one with the sword. The sword was him, Ye Xuan, and Ye Xuan was the sword!
So, he could prove his Dao with the sword!
The little girl nodded slightly. "It's good that you understand!"
Ye Xuan looked at the little girl and said seriously, "Listening to Senior today is better than studying for 10 years. I've learned a lot!"
After a moment of silence, the little girl asked, "Are you really unable to contact your Master?"
Ye Xuan nodded and smiled bitterly. "He's gone to a very far place!"
The little girl fell silent.
Ye Xuan suddenly said, "Senior, how about this? Once I know Master's whereabouts, I'll immediately inform him and get him to help Senior."
The little girl looked at Ye Xuan. "Will he help me?"
Ye Xuan said seriously, "If Master knows that Senior gave me pointers earlier, Master will definitely be grateful!
Senior, rest assured. As long as he appears, I'll definitely get him to help Senior to repay Senior for your guidance today! "
The little girl nodded. "That's the only way!"
Ye Xuan suddenly said, "How should I address Senior?"
The little girl said, "Mu Sheng!"
Mu Sheng!
Ye Xuan nodded. "Miss Mu Sheng …"
He hesitated for a moment and said, "You don't mind if I address you like that, right?
Because I feel that you're very young and beautiful. It's not appropriate to call you Senior! "
Ye Zhiming was speechless.
The little girl said, "It's just a form of address. You can call me whatever you want!"
Ye Xuan nodded. "Alright, Mu Sheng!"
Mu Sheng!
The little girl was speechless.
Ye Zhiming was speechless.
Ye Xuan suddenly pointed at the Nether Realm in the distance. "Mu Sheng, according to what I know, the Nether Realm can't come to the Yang Realm. But earlier …"
Mu Sheng's eyes suddenly turned icy cold. It was like ten thousand year old ice, and it made one shudder. "Those bastards!"
Ye Xuan glanced at Mu Sheng curiously. "What did they do?"
Mu Sheng's face was expressionless. "Some of them forcefully held me back, and then some bastards from the Nether Realm escaped while I was off guard!"
Ye Xuan was furious. "They actually did something like that!"
Mu Sheng glanced at the Nether Realm with an icy cold gaze. "Those fellows have been very restless lately!"
Ye Xuan suddenly said, "Mu Sheng, I want to make a trip to the Nether Realm!"
Mu Sheng frowned. "You want to go to the Nether Realm?"
Ye Xuan nodded.
Mu Sheng shook his head. "You're not strong enough. It'll be dangerous if you go there!"
Ye Xuan said, "It's fine. I'll be careful!"
Mu Sheng looked at Ye Xuan. "Why are you going there?"
Ye Xuan said in a deep voice. "To be honest, we want to go there to find some treasures!"
Mu Sheng was silent for a moment. "Are you sure you want to go there?"
Ye Xuan nodded.
Mu Sheng said, "Then do me a favor!"
Ye Xuan asked. "What favor?"
Mu Sheng said, "I have two friends in the Nether Realm. They're called Man Zhu and Sha Hua. But for some reason, they're trapped in the Nether Realm. Can you help me get them out?"
"No!"
At that moment, Ye Zhiming suddenly spoke up from not far away.
Ye Xuan looked at Ye Zhiming in surprise. "What's wrong, Zhiming?"
Ye Zhiming ignored Ye Xuan. She looked at Mu Sheng with a cold expression. "He might be a little crafty, but he has no intention of harming you. Why do you want to harm him?"
Ye Xuan looked at Mu Sheng. It seemed that things weren't as simple as they seemed.
Mu Sheng looked at Ye Zhiming. "If you want to go to the Nether Realm, I can help you!
Also, I have no intention of harming him. He might be tainted by karma if he helps me, but please, his master is so powerful. What's there to be afraid of? "
Ye Xuan's mouth twitched. It's over!
This misunderstanding is too big!
Mu Sheng really thinks that the green-robed man is his master!
Ye Zhiming turned to Ye Xuan. "Don't agree to this!"
Ye Xuan was confused. "Why?"
Ye Zhiming said in a low voice, "Her two friends are actually the evil creatures of the Nether Realm, the Red Spider Lilies. Not to mention you, even those from the Nether Realm wouldn't dare to provoke them."
Ye Xuan said, "Is there any evil cause of disaster?"
Ye Zhiming was speechless.
Ye Xuan looked at Mu Sheng and smiled. "Senior, I agree to your request. However, I need you to help me with something."
Mu Sheng looked at Ye Xuan. "I wanted to go by myself, but I can't leave this place. Once I leave, the balance between the Nether Realm and the Yang Realm will be lost. At that time, the Nether Realm will seize the opportunity to wreak havoc!
Of course, you're an honest man, so I don't want to trick you. It's dangerous for you to do this, especially when you might be tainted by karma. "
Ye Xuan spoke in a low voice. "Senior, to tell you the truth, I don't want to go as well. However, Senior has provided me with some guidance. I, Ye Xuan, am a grateful person. Since Senior needs me, then I, Ye Xuan, will do it even if I have to climb a mountain of blades or dive into a sea of flames!"
Mu Sheng hesitated for a moment when she heard this, and then she said, "You're … too kind!"
At this moment, a trace of guilt had arisen in her heart.
Ye Zhiming was speechless.
Mu Sheng suddenly sighed softly. "It really isn't nice to let you go just like that!"
As soon as she finished speaking, she withdrew a palm-sized rock and passed it to Ye Xuan. "This is a World Stone, and it contains my energy. You can activate it at the critical moment, and it will form a barrier. Even if it's the Lord of the Nether Realm, you'll be able to trap him for a period of time!"
Ye Xuan hurriedly put the World Stone away and said, "Thank you!"
Mu Sheng suddenly pressed her fingers together and pointed forward. Two rays of black light shot into Ye Xuan and Ye Zhiming's bodies, and then their bodies actually vanished without a trace!
Their bodies were still there, but they couldn't be seen with the naked eye!
Mu Sheng said, "I've already concealed the energy within your bodies. In this way, you won't be noticed once you head to the Nether Realm. However, you still have to be careful!"
Ye Xuan nodded. "Mu Sheng, we'll be taking our leave!"
Mu Sheng nodded. "If it's impossible, then there's no need to force it!"
Ye Xuan smiled. He pulled Ye Zhiming who had an extremely unsightly expression on his face and left. However, he'd only taken a few steps when he suddenly stopped and turned around to look at Mu Sheng. "Mu Sheng, I can't guarantee that I'll be able to rescue your friends, but I'll do my best …."
When he spoke up to this point, he suddenly sent a voice transmission to Mu Sheng.
Mu Sheng gazed at Ye Xuan. A short while later, she nodded. "Alright!"
Ye Xuan grinned, and then he pulled Ye Zhiming along as they vanished into the distance.
Mu Sheng gazed towards the Nether Realm, and no one knew what she was thinking.
They'd made a small deal!
.....
In the distance, Ye Zhiming remained silent, his expression cold.
Ye Xuan smiled. "Don't be angry!"
Ye Zhiming sneered. "Why should I be angry?
It's not like I'm the unlucky one! "
Ye Xuan chuckled. "Without Mu Sheng's help, we won't be able to enter!"
Ye Zhiming took a deep breath. She looked at Ye Xuan. "Do you think you've made a profit?
Do you know what Red Spider Lily is?
It's the most evil thing in the Nether Realm, the Red Spider Lily. It's also known as the Forbidden Flower. Most importantly, it carries great karma! "
Ye Xuan frowned. "A flower?"
Ye Zhiming shook her head. "That's no ordinary flower!"
Saying so, she sighed. "The Red Spider Lily blooms for ten thousand years and wilts for ten thousand years. Its petals and leaves will never meet.
Love is not karma, but fate determines life and death! "
Ye Xuan frowned. "Aren't Red Spider and Sha Hua women?
Love? "
Ye Zhiming remained expressionless. "Can't two women fall in love?"
"…" Ye Xuan.
Ye Zhiming continued. "Buddha said that the opposite sex is only for reproduction, while the same sex is true love!"
Ye Xuan was dumbfounded.
.....
PS: Those with a guaranteed monthly ticket can vote for it!
Recently, I've been seeing a reader's comment section. His name is' Chill of Autumn and Winter ', and every chapter has a comment.
The Old Man calculated with his fingers. You don't want to be gay!









Chapter 1303
The opposite sex is only for reproduction, the same sex is true love!
Ye Xuan looked at Ye Zhiming, this little doll's thinking is a little dangerous!
As if thinking of something, Ye Xuan asked doubtfully, "Zhiming, did Buddha really say that?"
Ye Zhiming was expressionless, "It's up to you whether you believe it or not!"
Ye Xuan looked at Ye Zhiming, "I've read many Buddhist scriptures, but I don't recall any Buddha saying that!"
Ye Zhiming was expressionless, "Just because you haven't read it, does that mean it doesn't exist?"
Ye Xuan was speechless.
Which Buddha would say such nonsense?
What a joke!
At this moment, Ye Zhiming stopped and looked into the distance. Not far away, there was a group of eerie auras floating towards them!
Ye Xuan also stopped and looked into the distance. A few hundred zhang away from them, a gust of eerie aura was blowing towards them. Soon, he saw a group of spirits floating towards them!
Soul bodies!
At this moment, the Soul Subduing Sword in Ye Xuan's body was stirring!
Actually, the moment he entered the netherworld, the Soul Subduing Sword was already stirring!
To her, this place was heaven on earth!
However, Ye Xuan did not let her come out to absorb them. He had more important things to do here. As for absorbing souls, he believed that there would be more opportunities in the future!
Ye Zhiming suddenly said, "These should be the Yin soldiers!"
Ye Xuan said, "They seem to be floating towards us!"
Ye Zhiming nodded, "Yes!
Think of a way to trick them! "
Ye Xuan, "…"
At this moment, the spirits floated in front of Ye Xuan and Ye Zhiming.
The leading spirit looked at Ye Xuan with an unfriendly expression, "You …"
At this time, Ye Xuan suddenly took out the Soul Subduing Sword. In the next moment, the spirits in front of him were directly absorbed by the sword!
Ye Xuan immediately kept the sword into the Prison Pagoda.
Ye Zhiming suddenly said, "I was wrong!"
Ye Xuan was baffled. Ye Zhiming continued, "You will only fool those who are stronger than you."
Ye Xuan was speechless.
Ye Zhiming walked into the distance.
Ye Xuan said, "Knowing Destiny, do you look down on me because of what I did to Mu Sheng?"
Knowing Destiny said nothing.
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "Do you think I don't have any pride?"
Ye Zhiming replied, "There's no need for the two of you to be enemies. She only attacked you because you entered the boundary without permission. She didn't attack you because she was doing her job.
To put it simply, there was no need for you to become enemies with her. Instead, you used that kind of method to ease the relationship between you and her. You could even say that you became friends with her.
In this world, strength was very important, but EQ and methods were even more important.
I admire you for this, because in this aspect, you are much better than me. "
Ye Xuan said, "Then do you think that I was fooling and using you when we were together?"
Ye Zhiming glanced at Ye Xuan and laughed self-deprecatingly, "I was the one who was using you!
I approached you with ulterior motives. Even if you were to use me, it's understandable. What right do I have to resent you? "
Ye Xuan looked at Ye Zhiming and asked, "Then why are you angry?"
Ye Zhiming said, "I'm not angry!"
Ye Xuan was about to say something when Ye Zhiming suddenly stopped. She looked at Ye Xuan and asked, "Why are you so stupid?"
Ye Xuan was speechless.
Ye Zhiming pointed at herself and said, "You knew that I was using you, but you still let me follow you. Why?"
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "Knowing Destiny, why don't you think about it from another angle?"
Ye Zhiming looked at Ye Xuan and said nothing.
Ye Xuan said, "You followed me with ulterior motives, but what about helping me?
Without you, I wouldn't have been able to reach Release One. Without you, I wouldn't have been able to cultivate Dao scriptures and martial arts. Without you, Aro and the others wouldn't have been able to reach Release One in such a short time. Without you, I wouldn't have been able to obtain that Buddhist Dao scripture … "
Ye Zhiming was silent.
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "Zhiming, perhaps our meeting was a scheme, an ill-fated fate. But I think you're a good person, so I'm willing to be friends with you!"
Ye Zhiming looked at Ye Xuan and said, "You'll suffer because of me in the future!"
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "For a friend, I, Ye Xuan, can do anything."
Ye Zhiming sighed and said, "What an idiot!"
Actually, after interacting with Ye Xuan, she found a problem. Ye Xuan was very flashy, but he was very sincere to his friends and the people around him.
She knew that the reason why Ye Xuan could gather so many people, other than the Dao scripture, was because of this!
In her world, for the Dao scripture, let alone friends, even fathers and sons would kill each other.
But Ye Xuan was willing to share the Dao scripture with the people around him!
And this guy didn't have his guard up against her.
If you say he's stupid, then you're gravely mistaken. This guy is more shrewd than anyone, he'll only be 'stupid' in front of the people he approves of.
Thinking of this, Ye Zhiming's expression unknowingly became much gentler.
Ye Xuan suddenly said, "You all say that I have the cause of misfortune on me, that it will bring me disaster. But I think, just like what the Dao scripture says, nothing is absolute, fortune and misfortune come hand in hand."
Ye Zhiming was silent.
Ye Xuan suddenly stopped in his tracks. In front of the two of them was a city with a sign hanging on the city gate, with the words' Gates of Hell 'written on it.
Ye Xuan furrowed his brows and asked curiously, "Gates of Hell?"
Ye Zhiming nodded, "Only after entering the Gates of Hell can we be considered to have truly entered the nether world!"
Ye Xuan looked at the entrance of the Gates of Hell, where there were Yin soldiers standing guard. Occasionally, there would be Yin souls drifting into the Gates of Hell!
Ye Xuan asked, "Do people from the mortal world come here after they die?"
Ye Zhiming shook his head, "In the past, when the Great Daos of Yin and Yang were still around, the souls of those from the mortal world would be forcefully brought to the nether world when they die. Then, the nether world would use their merits to reincarnate them.
But a long time ago, the Great Daos collapsed and the order was in chaos. So, after the people from the mortal world die, as long as they are strong enough, they don't have to come to the nether world, and the nether world can't step into the mortal world to retrieve their souls! "
Ye Xuan asked in a deep voice, "Who broke these Great Daos?"
Ye Zhiming replied softly, "I don't know!
All I know is that a long time ago, there were all kinds of order in the world, but now, many things have disappeared!
In any case, the order of the universe is in chaos now, it's hard to explain! "
After a moment of silence, Ye Xuan said, "Let's go!"
After saying that, he dragged Ye Zhiming towards the Gates of Hell. When the two of them entered the Gates of Hell, the two Yin soldiers did not stop them.
After entering the Gates of Hell, they entered a Bluestone Xiao Dao. This Xiao Dao was a little long, stretching as far as the eye could see.
On this bluestone path, there were a few ghosts floating around. These ghosts had empty eyes and were drifting aimlessly.
Ye Zhiming glanced at the Bluestone Xiao Dao beneath his feet and said softly, "This is the Yellow Springs Path, also known as the Path of Guidance.
Do you see those wandering ghosts? They are the real wandering ghosts! "
Ye Xuan looked at the wandering ghosts, "They don't seem to have any consciousness?"
Ye Zhiming shook his head, "They are lost!
Because they have been in this place for too long! "
Ye Xuan was puzzled, "Then why don't they leave?"
Ye Zhiming said, "Because they died an unnatural death. They can't ascend to heaven, reincarnate, or enter the Samsara Hall of the underworld. They can only wander on the Yellow Springs Path!
They can only report to the Samsara Hall after the Yang Shou arrives.
However, now that the Grand Dao of Reincarnation had collapsed, that place existed in name only, and these wandering ghosts without any strength or background were naturally forgotten by people!
So, they are trapped here, drifting, and as time passes, they have forgotten who they are! "
Ye Xuan fell silent.
Ye Zhiming said, "Let's go!"
Ye Xuan suddenly said, "Why don't we take them away?"
Ye Zhiming looked at Ye Xuan and Ye Xuan smiled, "Let's treat it as a good deed!"
Ye Zhiming nodded.
Ye Xuan took out Soul Quelling Sword and kept the wandering ghosts into it. Soul Quelling Sword could absorb souls, but it could also nourish them.
After keeping the wandering ghosts, Ye Xuan suddenly said, "Since this is the Yellow Springs Path, there should be a Yellow Springs River, right?"
Ye Zhiming nodded, "That river used to be on both sides of the Yellow Springs Path, but when the underworld discovered that the Yellow Springs River could condense Yellow Springs Holy Water, they moved it away!
Now, the Yellow Springs River is the sacred land of the underworld. Not to mention outsiders, even those in the underworld aren't qualified to go there! "
Ye Xuan nodded. No one knew what he was thinking.
Ye Zhiming suddenly said, "We will see the Red Spider Lilies soon!"
Ye Xuan said, "Man Zhu, Sha Hua?"
Ye Zhiming nodded.
Ye Xuan realized that as they walked, many bone-piercing chilly winds appeared around them. These chilly winds were very painful. It was not the flesh that hurt, but the soul that hurt. It was as if his soul was being pricked by needles. Fortunately, he had the Soul Suppressing Sword to guard his soul.
Ye Xuan looked at Ye Zhiming, "Zhiming, are you alright?"
Ye Zhiming shook her head, "This place can't hurt me!"
Ye Xuan nodded. He knew that Ye Zhiming might have recovered some of her strength, but he didn't know to what extent!
As the two walked, Ye Xuan suddenly felt a sinister aura. This sinister aura was filled with endless hatred and hostility.
The Evil Qi and Evil Qi were already able to affect him!
Ye Xuan frowned in shock, "What about the Red Spider Lilies?"
Ye Zhiming suddenly stopped and turned to Ye Xuan, "We can still make it if we retreat now!"
Ye Xuan asked, "Dangerous?"
Ye Zhiming looked at Ye Xuan and said, "You know that I'm a fortune-teller. If you interfere in this matter, something bad will really happen. It's not too late for us to retreat now."
After a long silence, Ye Xuan smiled and said, "Let's go take a look first!"
Ye Zhiming sighed softly. She did not try to persuade Ye Xuan any further because she could already see the answer in his eyes.
The two of them continued forward. The further they went, the stronger the evil aura and hostility became. Even though Ye Xuan had the Mad Demon Bloodline, he could not completely resist the hostility and evil aura!
Soon, the two of them came to a stop. Not far in front of them, which was also the end of the Yellow Springs Path, stood a flower. It was a bright red flower, a gorgeous red like blood.
Only the flowers, not the leaves!
Ye Zhiming said softly, "The Flower of the Other Shore blooms for ten thousand years and wilts for ten thousand years. The petals and leaves will never meet.
The flower is the Red Spider Lily, the leaves are the Red Spider Lily. When the flower blooms, the leaves are not seen, and when the petals fall, the flowers are not seen … Love is not karma, but fate determines life and death! "
Ye Xuan frowned slightly. "The flower has a spirit, and so does the leaf. Why can't they meet?"
Ye Zhiming glanced at Ye Xuan and said in a deep voice, "Because they were imprisoned here, and they were cast with an extremely terrifying curse and forbidden technique."
She paused for a moment before continuing, "A long time ago, the Red Spider Lily was also known as the Guiding Flower. Anyone who wants to reincarnate will come here and smell the flower's fragrance, and they will remember the events of their previous life!
When the soul passes through here, it will forget everything that happened in its previous life, leaving everything on the other shore. Those who have died will follow the guidance of the flower to the Reincarnation Hall, so it is also known as the Flower of the Other Shore.
Later, the flower and Ye Xiuhua became connected and gained a spirit. The two women fell in love with each other, so they met … However, it is said that a powerful figure was jealous of them, so he cast an extremely powerful curse and forbidden technique on them, making it impossible for them to see each other for the rest of their lives.
Red Spider Lily and Sha Hua are not immortal. They will also die, but when they die and come here, they will smell the flower's fragrance, and then they will remember their previous life. So, they swore to never be separated again, but they will fall back into the cycle of reincarnation, and so on … "
Hearing this, Ye Xuan suddenly felt infuriated. "What powerful figure?
How can he be so wicked? "
Hearing Ye Xuan's words, Ye Zhiming's expression changed drastically. "He has already broken through his Dao. You must not speak carelessly, lest you bring disaster upon yourself."
Ye Xuan said in a deep voice, "This is wicked!
What does it have to do with that bullshit powerful figure?
Cursing him because you're jealous, this kind of behavior … "
Saying this, he shook his head. "I despise him!"
At this moment, some red threads suddenly appeared around Ye Xuan's body …
Seeing this, Ye Zhiming's expression became a little ugly. "He knows you!"
Saying this, she looked straight at Ye Xuan and said angrily, "You idiot, can't you not cause trouble?"
Ye Xuan glanced at his surroundings and said softly, "If I curse her like this, she will know … By the way, if I curse Qing'er, will she be able to sense me?"
Qing Er. He had to admit, he was starting to miss Qing Er a little!
Ye Zhiming suddenly said angrily, "Qing Er my ass!
Do you know why even the Nether Realm doesn't dare to step into this place?
Because the Nether Realm is afraid of offending that powerful figure, so they don't dare to enter here and get involved with the karma of this place!
Also, do you really think that Mu Sheng can't come to the Nether Realm?
No, she has the ability to come, and she also has the ability to remove the curse and forbidden technique on this Red Spider Lily. However, she doesn't dare to come, because doing so is equivalent to offending that powerful figure.
You can't even beat Mu Sheng, so what right do you have to meddle in this matter?
What right do you have?
Because of that plain-dressed woman?
Do you think that your Qing Er … "
At this point, she suddenly stopped.
Damn, this Qing Er doesn't seem to be afraid of that powerful figure …
...









Chapter 1304
Following Ye Zhiming's silence, the entire place fell into silence.
Qing 'er!
This woman ended the conversation.
Ye Zhiming had never seen her before, but he knew how powerful she was!
Ye Zhiming sighed and said nothing else.
Ye Xuan suddenly said, "Zhiming, you want to interfere too, right?"
Ye Zhiming glared at Ye Xuan, "I don't want to interfere!"
Ye Xuan remained silent.
Ye Zhiming's expression was complicated, "There are so many injustices in the world, can you even interfere?"
Ye Xuan glanced at the Red Spider Lily and said softly, "There are so many injustices in the world, of course we can't interfere.
But since we've met them, let's interfere! "
Ye Zhiming sighed, his expression became even more complicated.
Ye Xuan walked up to the Red Spider Lily. At this moment, the Red Spider Lily gradually trembled. Soon, endless evil and evil energy poured out of the flower.
Ye Xuan suddenly said, "Man Zhu, if your spirit is still here, then show yourself!"
After a moment of silence, Man Zhu trembled violently and a woman in a red dress appeared in front of Ye Xuan and Ye Zhiming.
Man Zhu!
Man Zhu looked at Ye Xuan with bloodshot eyes, devoid of any emotion.
Ye Xuan said, "Miss Man Zhu, I only have one question for you. Back then, did that powerhouse really seal you guys out of jealousy?"
Man Zhu looked at Ye Xuan without saying a word.
Ye Xuan said, "I can save you!"
Man Zhu's expression softened, she said after a moment of silence, "Young master, please leave!"
Ye Xuan frowned, confused, "Why?
Don't you want freedom? "
Man Zhu looked at Ye Xuan, "I've heard what young master said!
I appreciate young master's kindness, but the person who cursed us is not someone you can defeat. Young master, don't make a mistake! "
Ye Zhiming suddenly said, "Even if you want to meddle in other people's business, you should consider your own strength!"
Ye Xuan was silent.
Not going to save him?
Seeing that this matter was being ignored, he felt angry and displeased.
Save?
If he were to save these two women, he would have to offend a powerful being, and this might implicate the people around him.
Ye Xuan did not hesitate at all. He looked at Man Zhu, "Miss Man Zhu, I will ask you one last time. Why did that supreme being seal you?
Was it really just jealousy?
But in my opinion, a super expert shouldn't be so narrow-minded. "
Seeing this sight, Ye Zhiming sighed softly.
Man Zhu glanced at Ye Xuan and said, "On many occasions, the stronger a person is, the narrower they are. Because they can't allow others to offend them in the slightest."
Ye Xuan frowned. "Did you offend him?"
Man Zhu sneered. She didn't say anything, but waved her right hand, and a blood-red curtain of light suddenly appeared in front of the three of them.
The scene on the screen was the Yellow Springs Road.
At the end of the Yellow Springs Road, a red flower stood proudly!
It was the Red Spider Lily!
However, the Paramita Flower on the screen of light had leaves, and it seemed extraordinarily gorgeous under the support of the green leaves.
The flowers and leaves embraced each other, and it was a beautiful scene!
Right at this moment, a woman suddenly appeared on the Yellow Springs Road. She wore a black dress, had long ink black hair that hung loosely on her shoulders, and held a black folding fan in her hand. There was a mysterious painting of mountains and rivers on the fan, and a small beast that seemed like both a dragon and a phoenix was sitting on her shoulder.
The woman's gaze suddenly descended onto the Paramita Flower. She sized it up, and then the corners of her mouth curled up slightly, "A flower is actually talking about love? How laughable!"
As she spoke, she suddenly pressed her fingers together, and then a strange talisman entered the Paramita Flower.
Bang!
In an instant, two shrill and shrill cries resounded from within the Paramita Flower, and then it swiftly withered.
Meanwhile, the woman suddenly shook her head and smiled, "Erasing it like that is quite boring!
Didn't the two of you want to talk about love?
I'll let the two of you talk to your heart's content! "
As she spoke, she pressed her fingers together lightly, and the Paramita Flower instantly started to show signs of vitality.
The corners of the woman's mouth curled up slightly, "I curse the two of you. The flower will bloom for 10,000 years, and it will wither for 10,000 years. The flower and leaves will never meet, and the cycle of reincarnation will be endless …."
As soon as she finished speaking, she started walking towards the distance. However, she suddenly stopped when she was about to leave the Yellow Springs Road, and then she turned around. At this moment, Ye Xuan's expression instantly changed. Because he noticed that the woman seemed to be looking at him!
How could this be possible?
The woman just looked at him and smiled, "I placed this curse on him. You can try and undo it!"
As soon as she finished speaking, she turned around and left.
The scene ended.
Ye Xuan fell silent. He knew that the woman's last words were directed at him.
But this was just too strange!
She can actually predict the future?
Is she so heaven defying?
Meanwhile, Man Zhu suddenly said, "Young Master, do you think we offended her?"
Ye Xuan shook his head, "No!"
As he spoke, he sighed softly.
Willful!
At this moment, he suddenly thought of something Mu Niannian once said. The stronger a person is, the more willful they might be. And the willfulness of those super experts might be a disaster to others!
Just like him now, if he, Ye Xuan, was willful, the entire Fifth Dimension might suffer a calamity!
Ye Xuan looked at Ye Zhiming. Ye Zhiming softly said, "Do you know what fan that woman was holding in her hand?"
Ye Xuan shook his head, "I don't know!"
Ye Zhiming looked at Ye Xuan, "That is called God Fusing Fan. It is a legendary super divine item.
I can tell you that a light fan of hers is enough to destroy a small world! "
Ye Xuan frowned slightly, "So exaggerated?"
Ye Zhiming continued, "Do you know the little beast on her shoulder?"
Ye Xuan nodded, "I see it!"
Ye Zhiming said, "That is the Beast Ancestor. It is known as the first demon beast in the universe!
As for its combat strength, I don't know.
Whether it is that fan or the beast race, they are all secondary. The most important thing is that woman. She was looking at you just now. What does this mean?
It means that she has already broken through the Dao and is no longer within the Dao. She can also sense the future, this means … I can only tell you that people like her are very, very rare in this world. "
Ye Xuan smiled, then said, "Zhiming, you have a way to break this curse, right?"
Ye Zhiming looked at Ye Xuan, "Are you sure you want to help?"
Ye Xuan nodded, "Actually, you also want to help them, right?"
Ye Zhiming was silent for a moment, then said, "What that woman did is indeed a bit inhumane, right?"
Actually, she did not want to get involved in this matter at first because she did not know the ins and outs of the matter.
But after knowing the ins and outs of the matter, she also wanted to help!
Because she also could not stand that woman's actions.
A willful person had trapped these two spirits for who knows how many lifetimes. This kind of behavior was no longer cruel, it was inhumane.
Ye Xuan said with a smile, "Then let's give them a hand!
Tell me how to break it, I will do it! "
Ye Zhiming said coldly, "Do you think I am afraid of her revenge?"
Ye Xuan said solemnly, "I know you are not afraid, Zhiming, but let me take responsibility for this matter!
In any case, I have the Cause of Adversity on me, why should I be afraid? "
Ye Zhiming walked over to Man Zhu and sized her up seriously before speaking in a solemn voice, "This curse isn't simple at all. The other party's curse has directly interfered with the trajectory of your destiny. It's a very violent interference!"
Man Zhu looked at the two of them, then said, "You really don't have to …"
Ye Zhiming suddenly pointed at Ye Xuan, "Do you know who he is?"
Man Zhu looked at Ye Xuan, "This young master is?"
Ye Zhiming said calmly, "He is the legendary second generation!" Ye Xuan was speechless.
Man Zhu blinked her eyes, "This …"
Ye Zhiming suddenly looked at Ye Xuan, "Use your Sword Domain to envelop Lady Man Zhu!"
Ye Xuan nodded, he walked in front of Man Zhu and used his Sword Domain to envelop her.
Ye Zhiming sat cross-legged on the ground, she formed a seal with both hands, "I will draw out the curse later, then you use your Sword Domain to suppress it, then use your sword to destroy it."
Ye Xuan frowned slightly, "Force it?"
Ye Zhiming said calmly, "Do you have any other way?"
Ye Xuan smiled sheepishly, "Zhiming, you can start!"
Ye Zhiming slowly closed her eyes, she soon began to silently recite the incantation. Not long after, Man Zhu's body gradually began to tremble, and after a while, a blood-red seal suddenly floated out of Man Zhu's body!
Seeing this, Ye Xuan stabbed out with his sword.
Chi!
The sword directly struck the blood-red seal, but Ye Xuan was instantly pushed back, and at the same time, the blood-red seal once again returned to Man Zhu's body!
Seeing this scene, Ye Xuan frowned, he looked at Ye Zhiming beside him, the latter said solemnly, "Your sword is not enough to destroy this curse!"
Ye Xuan said solemnly, "Then what should we do?"
Ye Zhiming fell silent.
Man Zhu suddenly said, "You two, let's do this!"
Ye Xuan looked at Man Zhu, and Man Zhu smiled slightly, "Sha Hua and I appreciate your kindness!
Perhaps, this is our fate. We once felt that it was unfair, but now we have surrendered to fate! "
Ye Xuan suddenly turned to Ye Zhiming, "Can I absorb the curse into my body?"
Ye Zhiming frowned slightly, "You're not joking?"
Ye Xuan said solemnly, "I already have the Cause of Disaster, I feel that if I add another curse, it might be able to fight fire with fire and get rid of the Cause of Disaster!"
Ye Zhiming looked at Ye Xuan, not saying a word.
Ye Xuan smiled awkwardly, "Can I?"
Ye Zhiming stared at Ye Xuan, "Are you sure you want to do this?"
Ye Xuan nodded, "If it's possible, then let's do it!"
Man Zhu suddenly said, "Young Master Ye … you …"
Ye Xuan smiled, "Miss Man Zhu, to tell you the truth, I made a small deal with Mu Sheng outside, I promised her to save you."
"Mu Sheng …"
Man Zhu shook her head, "Young Master Ye, you've tried your best, there's no need to do this."
Ye Xuan said seriously, "Miss Man Zhu, I'm doing this because I can't stand that woman's way of doing things, and also for myself!"
Ye Zhiming suddenly asked, "What deal did you make with Mu Sheng?"
Ye Xuan smiled, "A small deal!
Zhiming, let's begin!
This time, I'll absorb it directly! "
Ye Zhiming said solemnly, "Are you sure?"
Ye Xuan nodded, "I'm sure!"
Ye Zhiming looked deeply at Ye Xuan, "I hope it can really fight fire with fire!"
After saying that, she started chanting an incantation. Soon, the blood-red seal flew out again, and Ye Xuan directly absorbed it …
Boom!
As soon as the crimson seal entered Ye Xuan's body, Ye Xuan's blood instantly boiled.
Ye Xuan's face changed, "What's going on?"
Ye Zhiming looked at Ye Xuan, said softly, "I understand!
The curse is based on the blood, and it's not an ordinary curse, it's not just targeting your bloodline … Damn, don't tell me she's going to curse your father too? "
Ye Xuan, "…"
In the distant starry sky, a Swordsman in a green robe suddenly stopped, he turned around and frowned, "Who wants to mess with me?"
....
PS: Asking for tickets!!!









Chapter 1305
There was a woman and a little girl next to the green-robed man.
The woman wore a white robe and had a ponytail. She held a spear in her hand and there was a heroic spirit between her brows.
The little girl was dressed rather garishly. She wore a white short-sleeved shirt and there was a small picture of a little monster in the middle of her shirt. The little monster looked harmless and cute.
As for her lower body, she was wearing a pair of tight-fitting pants. There were two small holes on the knees of the pants. These two small holes looked a little strange.
She wore a pair of white shoes on her feet. Although the shoes were normal, she wore them the other way around.
She wore white shoes the other way around. What a character!
There was a white furry little fellow lying on the little girl's shoulder. The little fellow wore an unknown strange thing on her head and she was shaking rhythmically.
The woman looked at the green-robed man and frowned. "Did something happen?"
The green-robed man nodded. He looked at the blood-red threads that couldn't get close to him and said softly, "This should be a curse … I've been gone for so long. Who has the time to mess with me?
Did they eat too much? "
After saying that, he looked up.
He looked across the Myriad Star Region.
Somewhere in the clouds, in front of a huge palace, a woman suddenly looked up. She squinted her eyes and immediately stood up. She said coldly, "Which bastard has the guts to spy on me? Isn't he afraid of being consigned to eternal damnation?"
She didn't see who was spying on her, but she could feel that someone was spying on her!
In the starry sky, the green-robed man heard the woman's words and frowned. "What's wrong with you?
Can you speak human language? "
After saying that, he drew his sword and swung it.
Swish!
A ray of sword light suddenly pierced through the starry sky and arrived directly above the palace. At that moment, the woman's expression changed!
It wasn't just the woman. Countless experts around the palace were also shocked.
Someone had invaded the Daoting world?
At that moment, the woman opened her right hand and the Gods United Fan in her hand suddenly shot into the sky. A destructive force swept out from the Gods United Fan. However, before it could get close to the ray of sword light, the force and the super divine weapon disappeared without a trace.
Seeing this, the woman's face instantly turned pale.
At this moment, a white-bearded old man suddenly appeared in front of the woman. The white-bearded old man looked at the Sword Qi that was slashing down, and his expression was incomparably grim. He opened his palm and spun it lightly before pressing it upwards. "Myriad Daos, Heaven and Earth Transformation!"
In an instant, the space in front of him became illusory, and countless mysterious forces gathered in front of him like mountains and rivers.
At this moment, the sword light slashed down.
Chi!
The sword light easily tore through the mysterious power and pierced through the white-bearded old man's forehead.
Blood splattered everywhere!
The white-bearded elder looked at the sky in a daze. "How … How is this possible …"
Behind the white-bearded old man, the woman's face was also filled with fear. "Teacher …"
She couldn't imagine that her teacher would be killed with a single strike!
Instant kill!
At that moment, the woman's mind was blank!
In the starry sky, the green-clothed man was about to attack once more when he suddenly turned his head and seemed to have noticed something. He spoke softly, "Let's go!"
The spear-wielding woman said in a deep voice, "Did you sense it?"
The green-robed man nodded.
Soon, the group headed deep into the starry sky.
In the starry sky, the spear-wielding woman said in a deep voice, "She's gone!"
By 'she', she was naturally referring to the plain-clothed woman.
The green-clothed man smiled and said, "Back then, I told her to leave him alone, but she wouldn't listen and insisted on following him for a period of time. However, it was during this period of time that he developed a lot of dependence!
Sigh, once that woman decides on something, she doesn't listen to anyone else. I can't fight with her over such a small matter, right? "
The woman glanced at the green-clothed man and said, "I don't think she did anything wrong. You're different from him. You can't leave him alone just like your father did back then. Your life has been full of ups and downs, but most of it is due to your personality. However, his life has been full of ups and downs because of us."
The green-clothed man pursed his lips and said, "I had such a miserable life back then. Why should I let him live comfortably?"
The woman rolled her eyes at the green-clothed man and said, "Forget it!
Leave him alone then!
Speaking of which, don't you think you should meet him? "
The green-clothed man smiled and said, "There will be plenty of opportunities in the future."
The woman shook her head and sighed. She seemed to have thought of something and said, "Aren't you going to kill that woman?"
The green-clothed man looked deep into the starry sky and said softly, "Business is more important!
Also, Jing 'er, I don't usually kill people! "
The woman nodded and said, "I know. You usually don't kill people."
The green-clothed man was speechless.
At this moment, the little girl suddenly said, "Brother, when are we going to the curtain?
Sister Shuang's hometown to play? "
The green-clothed man was about to speak when the woman glanced at the little girl. The little girl immediately cowered and lowered her head slightly and said, "I … I don't want to play. I'm just asking …"
Soon, the green-clothed man and his group disappeared into the starry sky.
...
Daoting.
In front of the palace, an old man in a Taoist robe suddenly appeared in front of the woman. He looked at the white-bearded old man's corpse and said softly, "What a strong sword qi!"
The woman looked at the old man and said, "Old Divine Lord, did you find him?"
The Divine Lord shook his head and said, "Not yet!
He might be a little far from us! "
The woman said fiercely, "No matter who he is, kill him!"
The Divine Lord put away the white-bearded old man's corpse and then looked deep into the starry sky and said softly, "The Tao Ancestor is in seclusion and all kinds of demons and ghosts dare to come out!
Sixth Princess, stay here and wait for the Tao Ancestor to come out of seclusion. I'll go and meet this person! "
After saying that, he disappeared on the spot.
The woman was silent for a moment before she turned and walked back to her bedroom. At this moment, she seemed to have thought of something and her expression became ferocious, "Little mortal ant, how dare you break my curse!"
After saying that, she turned and left.
...
Underworld.
On the Bridge of Helplessness, Ye Zhiming looked at Ye Xuan and said, "How do you feel now?"
Ye Xuan felt his body and said, "I feel normal!"
Ye Zhiming was silent.
Ye Xuan said in a low voice, "Zhiming, does the curse affect me?"
Ye Zhiming said, "Maybe, but it definitely won't affect you too much. That's because the curse is a blood curse and your bloodline is too terrifying!
So, if I'm wrong, the blood curse might not have any effect on you! "
Ye Xuan nodded. He also noticed that the blood curse had no effect on him.
Ye Xuan's blood was the most abnormal in his entire body!
Right at this moment, Man Zhu's figure suddenly trembled slightly, and it wasn't long before another woman appeared by her side.
The woman wore an emerald green dress, and her appearance was somewhat similar to Man Zhu.
Ye Xuan knew that this woman should be Sha Hua!
After Sha Hua appeared, the two women immediately hugged each other!
The two women hugged each other tightly and remained silent for a long time.
Ye Xuan and Ye Zhiming looked at each other and felt a little emotional.
A super expert's willfulness had caused these two women to suffer for countless lifetimes!
At this time, Man Zhu and Sha Hua suddenly walked in front of Ye Xuan and Ye Zhiming. The two women slowly knelt in front of Ye Xuan and Ye Zhiming.
Ye Xuan quickly helped the two women up. Ye Xuan smiled and said, "Miss Man Zhu, there's no need for such formalities!"
Man Zhu looked at Ye Xuan with a complicated expression, "Young Master, in order to save us …"
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "I've said it before.
Other than disliking that woman's behavior, there's another reason why I'm helping you. That's because I've promised Miss Mu Sheng. "
Man Zhu bowed respectfully, "No matter what, Sha Hua and I will never forget Young Master's kindness."
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "Let's go quickly!
Find a place and live a good life.
If fate wills it, we will meet again in the future! "
Man Zhu and Sha Hua looked at each other and in the next moment, the two suddenly walked in front of Ye Xuan. Ye Xuan was confused, but the two women kissed his cheeks.
Ye Xuan was stunned.
Ye Zhiming looked at the scene in front of him, not knowing what to think.
Soon, the two women left.
Ye Xuan was a little confused. He looked at Ye Zhiming and Ye Zhiming said softly, "That's the Kiss of Other Shore, also known as the Kiss of Blessing. It's their blessing for you."
Ye Xuan blinked, "My luck will get better?"
Ye Zhiming shook his head, "I don't know. I only know that the Kiss of Other Shore is also a Kiss of Blessing.
Whether it works or not, I don't know! But I think they kissed you because they like you! "
Ye Xuan was a little confused, "Why do you say so?"
Ye Zhiming said indifferently, "Why didn't they kiss me?"
Ye Xuan was speechless.
Ye Zhiming suddenly said, "What deal did you make with Mu Sheng?"
Ye Xuan smiled, "Just a small deal!"
Ye Zhiming looked at Ye Xuan, "No matter what deal you made with her, you've suffered a loss!
Because you've offended a super powerful person. This bad karma will bring you a lot of bad karma in the future. "
Ye Xuan smiled, "Actually, even if I didn't make a deal with her, I would still help her. And I believe you will too!"
Ye Zhiming said coldly, "I won't."
Ye Xuan smiled, "Zhiming, if you don't know, you wouldn't have taken the initiative to draw out the blood curse!"
Ye Zhiming looked at Ye Xuan, "Anyway, you're the one who offended that big shot. What's there to be afraid of?"
Ye Xuan laughed, "So be it!"
Ye Zhiming sighed, "Let's go!"
Ye Xuan nodded and the two continued forward.
This time, their goal was to find the Dao scripture!
After the two of them left the Yellow Springs Path, they arrived in front of a river. The river was long and wide, and its water was blood yellow in color. Within the river, there were some ferocious vengeful spirits, evil spirits, and some ugly insects and beasts!
The entire river was filled with a foul stench and ear-piercing wails.
Ye Xuan was shocked by the scene before him!
What the hell is this?
Ye Xuan turned to look at Ye Zhiming, who said softly, "The River of Forgetfulness!
Do you see that bridge? "
Ye Xuan looked into the distance. There was a bridge over the river. The bridge was divided into three levels.
Ye Zhiming continued, "On the Bridge of Forgetfulness, no one can cross the River of Forgetfulness.
There is no right or wrong in front of the Stone of Three Lives, and Granny Meng is at the Village Viewing Platform.
Previously, the Stone of Three Lives was beside the River of Forgetfulness, and it was also known as the Stone of Three Lives.
Now … the Stone of Three Lives is gone, and Granny Meng should be gone too. "
Ye Xuan was surprised, "The Stone of Three Lives was here?"
Ye Zhiming nodded, "Yes.
Back then, she was also trapped here. However, she still managed to escape in the end! "
Ye Xuan said softly, "No wonder she hates this place so much!"
As he spoke, he looked at the River of Forgetfulness. From time to time, there were ghosts and evil spirits howling in the river.
Ye Xuan asked softly, "What are those?"
Ye Zhiming said, "A lonely soul trapped in it!"
As she spoke, she glanced at Ye Xuan, "Don't think about saving them!"
Ye Xuan was puzzled, "Why?"
Ye Zhiming pointed at the Bridge of Forgetfulness, "The Bridge of Forgetfulness is divided into three levels. The ghosts of good and evil walk the upper level, the middle level, and the ghosts of evil walk the third level.
As for the evil and evil, they don't have the right to walk on the bridge, so they can only swim towards the river. If the River of Forgetfulness can wash away their sins, they can swim across it, reach the other side, and enter the Samsara Temple to reincarnate and start all over again! "
As she spoke, she glanced at the wandering ghosts in the River of Forgetfulness, "The fact that you can see them now means that their sins are grave, and they aren't worth saving!"
Ye Xuan asked in a low voice, "What is considered a good person?"
Ye Zhiming smiled, "A long time ago, one had to accumulate good deeds to be considered a good person. But now, as long as one doesn't do evil, one is considered a good person!"
Ye Xuan said softly, "So, strictly speaking, I'm not a good person?"
Ye Zhiming said indifferently, "What do you think?"
Ye Xuan smiled sheepishly, he looked at the Bridge of Forgetfulness, "Zhiming, to be honest, I'm very curious about the world where the Great Dao was complete."
Ye Zhiming shook his head, "You won't like it!
Because if you were born in that world, your actions would be enough to send you to the eighteenth level of hell.
Moreover, although the Great Dao was complete in that era, it was still humans who upheld the rules of the Great Dao, and where there are humans, there is no fairness.
Why did so many people defy the heavens and defy the Great Dao?
It's because there are too many unfair things!
To put it simply, the Great Dao is fair, but the people who uphold it aren't as fair as it is, do you understand what I mean? "
Ye Xuan nodded, "I understand!"
Ye Zhiming continued, "If there's injustice, there will be people who resist, so countless experts rose up and broke through the Great Dao … In any case, it became like this!
In this world, the strong are revered, and those with bigger fists can turn black and white upside down!
As for good and evil … those who do good will not necessarily be rewarded, and those who do evil will not necessarily be repaid with evil. On the contrary, the evil may live a better life.
As for good person … good person and honest person in this world are a bit of a derogatory term. "
Saying so, she shook her head and laughed, a little sarcastically, "Just like in the secular world, people only care if you have money or not, who cares if you are a good person or not?
But if you have money and power, even if you do evil, you can package yourself in a glamorous way.
In this world, people laugh at the poor, not at the prostitutes. "
Ye Xuan fell silent.
Good person?
He didn't know how to be a good person, but he knew that if others were good to him, he would be good to them.
To put it simply, repay kindness with kindness, and take revenge with a clear conscience.
Ye Xuan collected his thoughts and looked at the Bridge of Helplessness, "Who is that Meng Po you mentioned before?"
At this moment, an old woman suddenly appeared on the Bridge of Helplessness. She stood beside the bridge, and she was boiling soup …
Seeing this, Ye Xuan was stunned. He looked at Ye Zhiming, "Didn't you say that Meng Po is no longer here?"
Ye Zhiming stared at the old woman, and a moment later, she looked at Ye Xuan and said angrily, "What are you looking at?
A person who disappeared for at least a hundred thousand years suddenly appeared to boil soup for you!
Hurry up and drink it!
This soup is very nutritious, it can boost your sex drive! "
The corner of Ye Xuan's mouth twitched.
Damn, this old woman couldn't have come here just for me, could she?
Boil soup for me?
Would this soup really boost my sex drive?
....









Chapter 1306
Ye Zhiming's face darkened.
Meng Po!
She knew this person from Dao Yi, but this person had disappeared tens of thousands of years ago.
Why would she appear here and cook soup?
She knew it was because of Ye Xuan without a second thought!
Other than the unluckiest person in the world, who else could make a person who had disappeared for tens of thousands of years come here to cook soup?
This Ye Xuan is poisonous!
At the start, she thought that following Ye Xuan would bring disaster to Ye Xuan!
But now, it seems that she was gravely mistaken!
Damn it! Following him would only bring about a huge disaster for me!
At this moment, Ye Xuan suddenly tugged on Ye Zhiming's sleeve and said softly, "Zhiming, this is Meng Po, right?"
Ye Zhiming glared at Ye Xuan, "What do you think?"
Ye Xuan said solemnly, "She appeared for me?"
Ye Zhiming said solemnly, "At least you have some self-awareness. Someone wants you dead!"
Ye Xuan frowned, "What do you mean?"
Ye Zhiming sighed, "Look around you!"
Ye Xuan looked around and frowned, "What's wrong?"
Ye Zhiming pointed his finger at Ye Xuan's eyes, "Look again!"
Ye Xuan glanced around. Soon, his expression changed.
Around him, there were some mysterious black threads. These threads were tightly locking the space around him. Unknowingly, the space around him had been sealed by a mysterious power.
Ye Xuan said solemnly, "What is this?"
Ye Zhiming looked around and said softly, "The Law of the Great Dao!"
Ye Xuan frowned, "What do you mean?"
Ye Zhiming said, "Someone has reconstructed the shattered Great Dao. In other words, you are now under the Law of the Great Dao of the Underworld. You have to follow their Law … Cross the Bridge of Helplessness, drink Meng Po's soup and enter the Path of Reincarnation."
Ye Xuan frowned, "Zhiming, didn't you say that the Great Dao has collapsed?"
Ye Zhiming nodded, "Yes!
Many of the Laws and Order of Heaven and Earth have disappeared!
However, not all the Great Dao laws were reversed by someone!
Obviously, you've seen a legendary guardian of the Great Dao, and you're currently under the Great Dao Laws of the Netherworld. "
Ye Xuan looked at Meng Po on the Bridge of Helplessness, "Meng Po is a Great Dao Protector?"
Ye Zhiming nodded, "Yes!"
Ye Zhiming said, "Ye Zhiming," Po's Meng Po 'Ye Xuan.
Chi!
The sound of air rang in the air, but that was it Po '.
Ye Xuan was a little stunned. The power of the Great Path Laws was a little strange!
Po 'Mo's Ye Menof Dao. of of of of Po' Mo's is, "Xuan"
She turned to Ye Xuan, "Unless you can break the Dao, or reach the Dao Validation realm. That's because the Great Dao is divided into strong and weak. If you can reach the Dao Validation realm, this won't be able to trap you!"
Ye Xuan thought for a moment and was about to activate his bloodline power when Ye Zhiming said, "Don't do it yet, let's go take a look!"
Ye Xuan nodded, "That's fine!"
The two walked towards the Bridge of Helplessness.
Ye Xuan suddenly asked, "Zhiming, who do you think wants to kill me?"
Ye Zhiming shook his head, "You and I have Mu Sheng's help, the Underworld probably doesn't know we're here …"
Ye Xuan suddenly said, "Then there are two people left. The first one is the one Qing'er is going to deal with. He is also the one who gave me the Cause of Disaster. However, I don't think he is the one!
Other than this person, there's only one left! "
Ye Zhiming said solemnly, "It's her!"
Her!
The woman who put the curse on Man Zhu and Sha Hua!
Ye Xuan nodded, "It should be her!"
Ye Zhiming said softly, "The other party's revenge is a little too quick!
Ye Xuan said, "The other party's main body shouldn't be here."
Ye Zhiming looked at Ye Xuan, "I think I've guessed that woman's background!"
Ye Xuan asked curiously, "What's her background?"
Ye Zhiming looked into the distance and said softly, "To be able to do this, she must be from that place …"
Just as Ye Xuan was about to speak, Ye Xuan noticed that the space around him and Ye Zhiming was turning illusory!
Ye Zhiming said solemnly, "Come, let's cross the Bridge of Helplessness!"
She led Ye Xuan towards the Bridge of Helplessness. When the two arrived at the bridge, Ye Xuan wanted to go to the top layer, but a mysterious force blocked his way!
Ye Xuan looked at Ye Zhiming and Ye Zhiming said, "Let's go to the second layer!"
Ye Xuan nodded and led Ye Zhiming towards the second level. This time, the two of them stepped onto the second level bridge without a hitch.
Ye Zhiming said, "Half good and half evil!"
Ye Xuan smiled, "Let's go!"
Half good and half evil!
He had guessed it from the start!
Because his previous sword intent was the Good and Evil Sword Intent!
But now, his sword intent was formless and had reached the Sword Transformation Realm. Therefore, he no longer cared about the Good and Evil Dao.
The two of them slowly walked into the distance. Along the way, countless evil spirits and wraiths roared at them from both sides. The faces of these evil spirits and wraiths were ferocious, and they roared hysterically. Some of them even charged towards Ye Xuan and Ye Zhiming!
However, these evil spirits and wraiths couldn't get close to the Bridge of Helplessness.
Ye Xuan glanced at the evil spirits and wraiths. Thank goodness he didn't help them. These evil spirits didn't look like good things!
As if he had thought of something, Ye Xuan suddenly opened his palm and the Soul Suppressing Sword appeared in his hand.
Ye Zhiming looked at Ye Xuan, "What are you doing?"
Ye Xuan smiled, "Zhiming, how many evil spirits and wraiths do you think there are in the River of Forgetfulness?"
Ye Zhiming said in a low voice, "Countless!"
The corner of Ye Xuan's mouth curled up. The Soul Suppressing Sword in his hand flew out and disappeared into the River of Forgetfulness.
Soon, a powerful aura spread out from the River of Forgetfulness. Then, a black whirlpool appeared not far away from the two of them. Countless evil spirits and wraiths were devoured by the black whirlpool …
Ye Zhiming took a deep look at the black whirlpool. She knew that when the Soul Suppressing Sword reappeared, there would be an earth-shattering change!
Of course, the prerequisite was that she and Ye Xuan were both alive.
Ye Xuan suddenly said, "Zhiming!"
Ye Zhiming looked at Ye Xuan with a hint of doubt in his eyes, "What are you doing?"
Ye Xuan grinned and took out an item and placed it in Ye Zhiming's hand.
Ye Xuan opened his palm and saw that it was the life-saving stone that Mu Sheng had given to Ye Xuan!
Ye Zhiming looked at Ye Xuan. Ye Xuan smiled, "If the situation turns bad, you can leave. With this, you can escape!"
Ye Zhiming looked at Ye Xuan, "What do you mean?"
Ye Xuan shook his head, "Nothing. I brought this upon myself. I can't drag you down with me!"
Ye Zhiming suddenly threw the stone at Ye Xuan and said angrily, "Drag me down?
You're telling me that you're afraid of dragging me down? Then what were you doing before? "
Ye Xuan was about to speak when Ye Zhiming added, "Also, do you think I'm afraid of that woman?
Let me tell you, even if she comes in person, she won't be able to kill me!
If you have the heart to do that, you'd better worry about yourself! "
With that, she turned and walked towards Meng Po.
Ye Xuan tugged on Ye Zhiming's sleeve, "Are you angry?"
Ye Zhiming shook off Ye Xuan's hand, his face expressionless, not saying a word.
Ye Xuan hesitated, "I just don't want to drag you down!"
Ye Zhiming stopped and looked at Ye Xuan, "You said that you treat me as a friend, right?"
Ye Zhiming stopped and looked at Ye Xuan, "You said that you treat me as a friend, right?"
Ye Xuan nodded.
Ye Zhiming sneered, "If you really treated me as a friend, you wouldn't have let me leave alone at a time like this. You gave me that stone, so it's obvious that you don't treat me as a friend!
I believe that if Miss An was here, you definitely wouldn't have let her leave alone, right? "
Ye Xuan fell silent.
If An Lanxiu was here, he definitely wouldn't have let her leave alone, because he knew that she wouldn't have left alone.
Thinking of this, Ye Xuan suddenly sighed, "I'm sorry!"
Ye Zhiming looked at Ye Xuan, "What are you sorry for?"
Ye Xuan said seriously, "You already treat me as a friend. If not for that, you wouldn't have agreed to come to the Nether Realm with me, nor would you have agreed to help save Man Zhu and Sha Hua … It's my fault, I was out of my mind and didn't think of this. I always thought that you were only following me to avoid trouble and obtain the scriptures!"
Ye Zhiming sneered, "Let me tell you, you're not wrong. I'm following you to avoid trouble and obtain the scriptures!"
Ye Xuan smiled, "Alright, alright, since you're using me, I'll use you too!"
Ye Zhiming glared at Ye Xuan, "Don't be so mischievous, I'm very serious!"
Ye Xuan hurriedly nodded, "I know, you're very serious, I'm also very serious!"
He knew that Ye Zhiming had a sharp tongue but a soft heart, so he had to play along with her.
Ye Zhiming took a deep breath, "You're really shameless!"
With that, she turned and walked away.
Ye Xuan laughed and hurriedly followed, "Zhiming, do you have any way to solve our current situation?"
Ye Zhiming remained expressionless, "No!"
Ye Xuan chuckled, then looked at the old woman cooking the soup, "Why don't we get rid of the one cooking the soup?"
Ye Zhiming looked at Ye Xuan, "Are you serious?"
Ye Xuan hesitated for a moment, then said, "Can't I beat her?
She's just a soup cooker! "
Ye Zhiming said angrily, "Beat your head!
This soup cooker used to be a deity, do you know what a deity is?
It's someone who is blessed by the Great Dao's nomological laws, this kind of person has the power of a deity.
Beat her to death? See that ladle she's using to boil the soup?
Do you see that ladle she uses to make soup? She can smash your head with one ladle. "
Ye Xuan looked at Meng Po, who was still cooking soup, and said softly, "If fighting won't do, then we'll fight with words!"
Ye Zhiming sneered, "Your words are all about bluffing, right?
If you can bluff her, I … "
Ye Xuan said provocatively, "You what?"
Ye Zhiming looked at Ye Xuan, "What do you want?"
Ye Xuan said seriously, "If I succeed, you'll kiss me, how about it?"
Hearing this, Ye Zhiming flew into a rage, "Ye Xuan!"
Ye Xuan hurriedly said, "The pure kind!"
Ye Zhiming stared at Ye Xuan, clenching her fists. Ye Xuan was about to say something, but she suddenly said, "Sure!"
Ye Xuan blinked, "I was just joking …"
Ye Zhiming was expressionless, "I'm serious!
Go!
Hurry up and bluff her!
If you don't, I'll bite you to death right now! "
Ye Xuan, "…"
Ye Zhiming suddenly said angrily, "Hurry up and start your performance!"
Ye Xuan smiled sheepishly, then walked towards Meng Po. Behind him, Ye Zhiming suddenly said loudly, "Meng Po, he's going to bluff you!"
Hearing this, Ye Xuan almost fainted!
Damn it!
Why is this woman like this?
At this time, Meng Po suddenly stopped boiling. She looked up at Ye Xuan and smiled sinisterly, "Are you trying to bluff me?"
Ye Xuan turned to glare at Ye Zhiming, then looked at Meng Po. He thought for a moment, then bit his finger, and a drop of blood emerged from his fingertip.
Ye Xuan pointed lightly, and the drop of blood floated in front of Meng Po. "Meng Po, before I die, I have a dying wish. I want to know who my father is. Can you fulfill my wish?"
Hearing this, Ye Zhiming suddenly felt a sense of unease.
Damn it!
This guy is going to risk his father!
When Meng Po saw that drop of blood essence, a rare trace of seriousness suddenly appeared in her calm eyes …
Ye Zhiming, "…"
At this time, Ye Xuan suddenly took out the Sword Spirit and placed it in front of Meng Po. "Meng Po, this sword belongs to my master. My master is the Sect Leader of the Sword Sect, and he wears a green robe … I know that I won't be able to escape death today, but this sword is innocent. Please let it go, Meng Po!"
Meng Po looked at the Sword Spirit, and her grip on the wooden ladle tightened unconsciously.
At this time, Ye Xuan took out another sword. It was the other sword at the top of the pagoda, the sword of the Banished Immortal Island's founder.
Ye Xuan placed the sword in front of Meng Po. "And this sword, this is my big brother's sword. My big brother likes to wear white robes … Meng Po, please return this sword to my big brother in the future, and help me tell him that I'm useless and can't look for him anymore!"
Meng Po looked at the two swords in front of her, and fell silent.
Before she finished, Ye Xuan suddenly opened his palm, and he smiled bitterly. "There's another person, her name is Qing 'er … I know that Meng Po definitely doesn't know her, but it's fine … Meng Po, you're so strong, you must be able to see the Cause of Misfortune on me, right?"
Meng Po looked at Ye Xuan, but didn't say anything.
Of course she could!
This was what shocked her the most at this moment. This guy had the Cause of Misfortune, but he was still alive … Moreover, this was the first time she had seen the legendary Cause of Misfortune!
So it wasn't a legend, but a real existence!
Just who is this guy?
Ye Xuan sighed softly. "The only reason I'm still alive now is because of Qing 'er's help against the Cause of Misfortune … But now, I know that I'm no match for Meng Po. After Meng Po kills me …"
Meng Po suddenly said, "You're saying that Qing 'er is helping you against the Cause of Misfortune?"
Ye Xuan blinked, "Yes!
Is there a problem? "
Meng Po looked straight at Ye Xuan, "No one can resist the Cause of Misfortune!"
Ye Xuan spread his hands, "But I'm still alive."
Two green lights suddenly flashed in Meng Po's eyes. At this moment, she seemed to see through Ye Xuan completely … A moment later, her hands suddenly trembled, her eyes filled with disbelief. There really was someone who was helping this guy block the Cause of Misfortune!
Just who was this guy?
Was he the reincarnation of some super expert?
Ye Xuan suddenly closed his eyes slowly, "Dad … Big Brother … Master … Qing 'er … Farewell!
Meng Po, do it!
I won't resist anymore! "
Meng Po looked at the two swords and the drop of blood in front of her, and after a moment of silence, she said, "Young Master, don't be like this. I'm just someone who makes soup, I've never thought of killing anyone …"
Ye Zhiming: "…"
....
PS: There's only one person I like, that person I'll vote for!









Chapter 1307
To boil soup!
On the side, Ye Zhiming's expression turned a little ugly.
She knew that Meng Po was afraid!
However, this was normal. Who wouldn't be afraid after seeing this guy's bloodline and swords?
It could be said that the stronger one was, the more they could sense the uniqueness of Ye Xuan's bloodline and the power of the two swords.
The other was the Cause of Misfortune!
Although this Cause of Misfortune represented misfortune, what did it mean to be able to survive with the Cause of Misfortune?
It meant that someone was helping Ye Xuan defend against the Cause of Misfortune.
How strong must one be to defend against the Cause of Misfortune?
Ye Xuan didn't say, but Meng Po had her own thoughts.
Meng Po slowly boiled the soup, thinking about something.
Ye Xuan blinked, "Meng Po, aren't you going to kill me?"
Meng Po glanced at Ye Xuan, "Young Master, aren't you going to use your blood and swords to tell me that you have someone behind you?"
Ye Xuan bowed slightly, "Senior, I can't beat you."
Meng Po said, "Don't worry, I can beat you, but I don't dare to."
Both of them were very frank.
Ye Xuan thought for a moment, then said, "Senior disappeared for tens of thousands of years and suddenly reappeared. You must have come for me. I wonder who dragged you here?"
Meng Po chuckled, "Young Master, why ask when you already know the answer?"
The woman with the fan!
Ye Xuan shook his head and smiled, "Her revenge is too quick!"
Meng Po shook her head and sighed, "Young Master, you really shouldn't have interfered with the Flower of the Other Shore!"
Ye Xuan looked at Meng Po, "I heard from Knowing Destiny that you are a deity, the protector of the Great Way Rules. Someone of your status, why …"
Meng Po smiled, "Because she has a higher status than me!"
Ye Xuan was silent.
Meng Po chuckled, "Young Master, don't worry, I won't do anything!
Before coming here, I thought that gongzi was just an ordinary person, so I wanted to do that person a favor and form a good relationship with him so that I could enter the Daoting and seek a better position.
However, from the looks of it now, not only is Young Master not an ordinary person, but he also has so many backers … Although killing Young Master will form a good relationship with that person, it will also create a huge karma. This deal is not worth it. "
Ye Xuan said in a low voice, "Senior, since she wants to kill me, why didn't she come herself?"
Meng Po looked straight at Ye Xuan, "Because in her eyes, you don't have the right to make her come here personally!"
Ye Xuan was speechless.
Meng Po shook her head and said, "Young Master, you really shouldn't have interfered with the Red Spider Lilies."
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "Senior should know the ins and outs of that matter, right?"
Meng Po nodded. "I can only say that they are unlucky!"
Ye Xuan laughed, "Bad luck?
The willfulness of the strong is the fate of the weak. What a joke! "
Meng Po looked straight at Ye Xuan, "This is how the world is!"
Ye Xuan looked straight at Meng Po, "I heard from Knowing Destiny that you are the guardian of the Dharma of the Great Way, and the Great Way used to be fair. Shouldn't you be fair too?
Otherwise, wouldn't you be smearing the name of the Great Way? "
Meng Po put down the wooden ladle in her hand and looked at Ye Xuan, "Fair?
Young Master, do you think there is such a thing as fairness in this world? "
Ye Xuan looked straight at Meng Po, "You are the guardian of the Dharma of the Great Way!"
Meng Po chuckled, "There is a saying in the secular world, 'When the Emperor breaks the law, he will be punished the same as the common people. Young Master, let me ask you, do you really think that the Emperor breaks the law and the common people are punished the same as the common people?"
Ye Xuan was silent.
Meng Po continued, "The Dharma of the Great Way is just like the laws in the secular world. It is fair, but our world is very complicated!
I have been brewing soup here for hundreds of thousands of years. According to the Dharma of the Great Way, anyone who comes here must drink this soup, forget their past life, and reincarnate.
However, there are many exceptions, such as those with status and background. They don't need to drink the soup and can reincarnate with their memories … This is unfair to many people, but so what?
Because I have to give them face. If I don't give them face, they won't give me face. Today, I am a god, but tomorrow, I may be sweeping the floor! "
Ye Xuan was silent.
Meng Po continued, "I am the guardian of the Dharma of the Great Way, but this doesn't mean that I can really act fairly.
Of course, there are some who act fairly, such as my predecessor. She acted fairly and didn't give face to anyone. Young Master, do you know how she is now?
She was stripped of her status as a god and became an ordinary person. Then, she died 100,000 years ago!
Ironically, after she came here, she hoped that I would let her not drink the soup and reincarnate for the sake of the past! "
Ye Xuan said softly, "I understand."
The Dharma of the Great Way was fair, but people were selfish.
It couldn't be said that people were selfish. It could only be said that people in this world often had to be flexible. If they didn't know how to be flexible and didn't understand the ways of the world, they would be played by others.
Righteousness?
Selflessness?
The human world wouldn't allow that!
Moreover, even Ye Xuan himself couldn't be truly selfless and fair.
If he were to brew soup here and meet his friends from his past life, he would definitely go easy on them.
The Great Way established order, but it was people who protected it!
Meng Po continued, "Just like now, under normal circumstances, I should let Young Master drink a bowl of soup. However, I won't force you to drink it, because if I do, there's a high chance that the people behind Young Master will take revenge on me in the future!"
As she spoke, she shook her head and smiled, "Anyone can do good deeds, but if there's a price to pay, then no one will do it.
And if there's a reward for doing bad deeds, then anyone will do it! "
Ye Xuan was silent.
Meng Po continued, "Young Master, why didn't you fear the enemy and save the Red Spider Lily?
Because Young Master has a strong enough trump card, so Young Master doesn't panic.
But if I may ask, what if there's no one behind Young Master?
Young Master, do you still dare to help? "
As she spoke, she shook her head and smiled, "Isn't it ironic?
Even if you want to do good deeds, you need to have the strength. Just like in a certain world, you have to consider whether you can support someone who has fallen … "
Ye Xuan said softly, "I've thought things too simply!"
Meng Po smiled, "Young Master isn't thinking things too simply, but thinking of people too simply!"
Ye Xuan shook his head, "Senior, I think you're quibbling.
Of course, what you said isn't without reason, but forgive me for being blunt, you have the authority given by the Great Way, but you can't be fair. What are you doing?
You're betraying the Great Way!
Since you can't do things fairly, then why do you want to maintain order in the Great Way?
Of course, you have to understand the ways of the world, but this isn't an excuse for you to be biased!
At the end of the day, you're just using the authority given by the Great Way for your own personal gain. "
As he spoke, he paused, then continued, "Just like just now, Senior had already disappeared, but in order to curry favor with that mysterious woman, you didn't hesitate to appear and mess with me!
Senior, what kind of behavior is this?
It's a classic example of bullying the weak and fearing the strong!
I don't think the Great Way is wrong, it's you who are protecting it that's wrong. "
Hearing this, Meng Po's eyes narrowed, murderous intent flashing in the depths of her eyes.
Ye Xuan's eyelids twitched. Damn it, isn't a gentleman using his mouth, not his fists?
At that moment, there was a sudden change. Meng Po's body suddenly trembled violently, and soon, countless tiny black dots of light appeared on her body, and these black dots of light began to slowly disperse in all directions!
Ye Xuan was struck dumb at the sight of this.
Meng Po looked at her body in horror, "No, no … no …"
Ye Xuan looked at Ye Zhiming, "What's wrong with her?"
Ye Zhiming stared at Meng Po, "The power of the Great Way in her body is disappearing … The Great Way is stripping her of her Godly Seat!"
Hearing this, Ye Xuan's eyelids twitched, "It can't be because of me, right?"
Ye Zhiming looked at Ye Xuan, "This is the first time I've realized that a mouth can be so powerful!
You're a genius!
Don't cultivate your sword in the future, cultivate your mouth!
Your mouth is invincible! "
Ye Xuan, "…"
At that moment, Meng Po suddenly roared, "No!
Don't! "
Ye Xuan and Ye Zhiming looked at Meng Po.
The black dots of light on Meng Po's body were dissipating rapidly.
Meng Po suddenly looked at Ye Xuan, her expression savage, "It's you!
It's you! "
Ye Xuan hurriedly said, "Meng Po, this has nothing to do with me, I don't know anything about the Great Way!"
Meng Po glared at Ye Xuan, roaring, "It's you who ruined my state of mind with your words, ruined my cultivation!
It's you!
It's you! "
Ye Xuan hesitated, then said, "If you want to say that, then ruin my state of mind and cultivation with your words!
Come on!
I won't resist, go ahead and scold me! "
"Pfft!"
Ye Zhiming suddenly burst out laughing.
Ruin Ye Xuan's state of mind and cultivation with words?
She didn't think anyone could do that!
Because this guy was shameless. You want to defeat a shameless person with words?
That was a fool's dream!
Hearing Ye Xuan's words, Meng Po flew into a rage. She was about to attack, but she found that she could no longer mobilize the power of the Great Way.
At this moment, Meng Po was shocked, she hurriedly looked at Ye Xuan, "Young Master … I already promised not to kill you, why do you still want to harm me?"
Ye Xuan thought for a moment, then said, "Senior, I didn't want to harm you, I just discussed it with you … I didn't expect it to turn out like this.
I don't think I harmed you, but the Great Way gave up on you. "
As he spoke, he looked at Ye Zhiming, "Right?"
Ye Zhiming nodded, "Yes."
Hearing Ye Xuan's words, Meng Po was stunned. The Great Way gave up on me!
At this moment, a tiny black mark suddenly appeared between Meng Po's brows, and when it appeared, Meng Po's entire body went limp.
Ye Xuan looked at the black mark, "This is?"
Ye Zhiming said, "The Mark of a God, it contains the power of the Great Way!"
At this moment, the Mark of a God suddenly flew in front of Ye Xuan. Seeing this, Ye Xuan's eyelids twitched, "What does it mean?"
Ye Zhiming looked at Ye Xuan, slowly clenching his fists, "What does it mean?
Isn't it obvious?
It wants you to become a god, congratulations, you're now a real god! "
....









Chapter 1308
A fraud!
Ye Xuan was speechless. He looked at Meng Po in the distance. Meng Po lay limp on the ground. Her face was abnormally pale. She was completely different from before. Now, she looked like an old woman with one foot in the grave.
Meng Po's gaze was dull as she murmured.
Ye Xuan was silent.
He had never thought of targeting Meng Po. After all, she had no intention of killing him. However, he had never thought that she would be stripped of her god just because of his words.
This was too childish.
Power came from the Grand Dao Laws?
This was given by the Grand Dao Laws, and the Grand Dao Laws could be taken back at any time!
Thinking of this, Ye Xuan had no more thoughts about the God's Seal.
The power that one cultivated was still the most reliable!
At this moment, Meng Po suddenly laughed self-deprecatingly. "No wonder after tens of thousands of years of cultivation, my god's power has not improved at all. So, it has long given up on me!"
Ye Xuan looked at Meng Po. Meng Po smiled sadly. "The funny thing is, I thought that everything I did was approved by it …"
At this point, she looked at Ye Xuan. "You're right. The Great Tao is fair. It's us, the guardians, who destroyed its fairness. As a result, many people in the world rebelled against the Tao and broke the Great Tao, causing chaos in the world …"
Ye Xuan said in a low voice, "Senior, all of your power comes from this God's Seal?"
Meng Po looked at the God's Seal and said softly, "In our era, as long as we obtained the approval of the Grand Dao, we could obtain the God's Seal. This God's Seal could allow us to easily reach the Self Release and Dao Confirmation Realm. Because the Dao is it, it can easily allow people to reach the Self Release and Dao Confirmation Realm.
What we cultivate is also this God's Seal. The stronger it is, the stronger we will be. However, once it leaves, our strength will disappear along with it! "
Saying this, she looked at Ye Xuan. "Do you know why some people can break through the Dao?
It's very simple. Because those who break through the Dao do not cultivate the God's Seal. Their power is cultivated by themselves. They are not bound by the Grand Dao Laws! "
Ye Xuan looked at the God's Seal. "If I obtain it, can I directly prove my Dao?"
Meng Po looked at Ye Xuan. "Yes!"
Ye Xuan shook his head with a smile. "Then let's not!"
He had to admit that he was a little tempted, but he didn't want to use this method to obtain power!
Strength was given by others, and others could take it back. But the strength cultivated by oneself would always belong to oneself.
Hearing that Ye Xuan didn't want it, Meng Po frowned, "Do you know what it is?
That's the Mark of a God. Once you obtain it, not only will you immediately become a God, but you'll also be able to obtain the power of a God's Seed. With your current strength, you'll be able to reach Dao Corroboration immediately. "
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "I don't want this kind of Dao Verification!"
Meng Po stared at Ye Xuan. "Are you sure you want to give up?"
Ye Xuan looked at the God's Seal, "You can go!
I'm not the best choice for you! "
However, the God's Seal didn't leave. Instead, it floated in front of Ye Xuan and tried to enter the space between Ye Xuan's eyebrows. Ye Xuan's expression changed. Damn it, it's trying to force its way in?
Ye Xuan hurriedly used his sword intent to block the God's Seal, but the God's Seal didn't give up. It wanted to enter Ye Xuan's body!
Seeing this scene, Meng Po was dumbfounded. What was this?
Back then, in order to obtain this God's Seal, she had done so many things and begged so many times …
But now, this God's Seal wanted to follow Ye Xuan of its own accord!
Why was there such a huge gap between them?
Seeing that the God's Seal insisted on following him, Ye Xuan frowned. What is this thing trying to do?
Ye Xuan looked at Ye Zhiming. Ye Zhiming said solemnly, "It wants you to become a Great Dao Protector …"
Ye Xuan shook his head, "I don't want this kind of power that can be taken back at any time. Of course, I don't want to boil soup here!"
Meng Po was speechless.
Ye Zhiming rolled his eyes at Ye Xuan, "First, you can borrow this power. As long as you borrow it and don't rely on it, there won't be a problem!
Second, the Great Dao of this world has basically collapsed. After you obtain it, you don't need to boil soup here. "
Ye Xuan looked at Ye Zhiming, "If I become a Great Dao Protector, does that mean I'll be tainted by the Great Dao's Karma?"
Ye Zhiming nodded, "Yes.
There are disadvantages and advantages. The advantage is that you stand on the side of the Great Dao. If you want to prove your Dao in the future, it will be much easier.
The disadvantage is that you'll be standing against those Dao Defiants. "
"Dao Defiants?"
Ye Xuan was a little surprised, "What are those?"
Ye Zhiming replied, "Those who can break through the Dao. They're called Dao Defiants."
Ye Xuan's eyelids twitched. Dao Defiants? In other words, I'm standing against those Dao Defiants!
Ye Zhiming continued, "Didn't you say that the Great Dao isn't wrong?
Since it isn't, then there's no need to avoid it. It's not a bad thing to be close to the Great Dao.
As for going against the Dao Defiants, there are too few in this world who can break through the Dao. "
Ye Xuan smiled, "Right, there's always a price to be paid for what you get!"
As he spoke, he withdrew his Sword Intent, and the God's Seal entered the center of his forehead.
Bang!
In an instant, countless strands of mysterious energy started to converge towards Ye Xuan!
The energy of a god!
Ye Xuan slowly closed his eyes, and his aura started to grow stronger and stronger!
Power!
At this moment, Ye Xuan sensed the powerful energy within the God's Seal, and he could immediately attain the Dao Corroboration Realm if he wanted to!
But he didn't do so!
He didn't want to attain the Dao Corroboration Realm so easily.
Ye Xuan started to suppress the energy, and it didn't take long for the God's Seal's power to be suppressed. He could use it or not.
Ye Xuan's body returned to normal!
Ye Xuan took a deep breath, and then looked at Ye Zhiming, "I have to say, even I was a little tempted just now. That power is too tempting!"
Ye Zhiming said indifferently, "You held back!"
Ye Xuan nodded, "I don't want to become a slave to some power!"
As if he had thought of something, he asked again, "Zhiming, then Mu Sheng …"
Ye Zhiming said, "She's not a god, she's one of the Great Dao!"
Ye Xuan said solemnly, "How many Great Dao are there?"
Ye Zhiming looked at Ye Xuan, "Three thousand Great Dao. Do you think that's a joke?"
Ye Xuan blinked, "There are so many Great Dao … In other words, there are strong and weak Great Dao, am I right?"
Ye Zhiming nodded, "Yes!"
Ye Xuan hurriedly asked, "What level is the Great Dao that acknowledged me?"
Ye Zhiming said indifferently, "You'll have to ask Meng Po!"
Meng Po!
Ye Xuan turned to look at Meng Po, who said solemnly, "In the Daoting, there are four types of gods: Ghost God, Human God, Empyrean God, and Dao God.
Ghost God and Human God are of the same level, but Empyrean God and Dao God are different!
They belong to the real gods, and they believe in the Great Dao, the real Great Dao, and they are very powerful.
The mysterious woman that Young Master offended was an Empyrean God. "
Empyrean God!
Ye Xuan narrowed his eyes, and no one knew what he was thinking.
Meng Po continued, "I work in the Nether Realm, so I'm also known as a Ghost God. However, there are three types of Ghost Gods, First-class Ghost Gods, Second-class Ghost Gods, and Third-class Ghost Gods. I belong to the Second-class Ghost God, and my position in the Nether Realm isn't low, but it isn't particularly high either."
Ye Xuan said solemnly, "In other words, I'm also a Second-class Ghost God?"
Meng Po nodded, "Yes!
However, you can become stronger. There are three thousand Great Daos, and the Great Dao cultivates on its own. Since it acknowledges you, it will become stronger as well if you become stronger, and if it becomes stronger, you will also become stronger.
Although your strength belongs to it, other than cultivation, a god also needs to be worshipped, and a worshipped god is very terrifying.
If you have many worshippers, your God's Seal will evolve, and it may evolve from Xiao Dao to Great Dao. In that case, you may become an Empyrean God, or even the legendary Dao God! "
Ye Xuan thought for a moment, then asked, "The more worshippers, the stronger the God's Seal, right?"
Meng Po nodded, "Not only that, but the stronger the worshippers, the stronger the God's Seal.
To put it simply, if you have more than ten Dao Validation experts worshipping you, your God's Seal will definitely reach the level of a Third-Class Heavenly God, or even higher. At that time, your strength will become even stronger. "
Ye Xuan suddenly said softly, "If I can make Qing 'er worship me …"
At this point, he suddenly shivered. Holy shit, isn't this too exciting?
Ye Zhiming also heard Ye Xuan's words, and her face also twitched!
The God's Seal that the plain-dressed woman worshipped Ye Xuan?
She didn't dare to think about it!
This is too crazy!
As if thinking of something, Ye Xuan asked again, "Can a person only have one God's Seal in their lifetime?"
Meng Po shook her head, "No, but most people only have one God's Seal, because a Great Dao can only choose one person!"
Ye Xuan was puzzled, "Why?"
Meng Po said solemnly, "Because a Great Dao will not be willing to share its chosen person with others. If two Great Daos choose one person, then the power of faith it receives will be weakened. So, under normal circumstances, each person will have one Dao, and one Dao Yi person!"
Ye Xuan was silent for a long time, then asked again, "Three thousand Great Daos, what is the most powerful Dao?"
Meng Po was silent for a long time, then said, "It could be the legendary Dao of Destiny. This Dao contains the supreme law, and all things in the world have their own destiny. If you obtain this Dao, you can control your own destiny, and the destiny of all living beings, but …"
At this point, she didn't say anything else.
Ye Xuan asked, "But what?"
Meng Po said solemnly, "Rumor has it that this Dao has been suppressed!"
Hearing this, Ye Xuan's eyelids twitched, "Suppressed?"
Meng Po nodded, "I don't know the details, but I do know that many Great Daos were reversed, so much so that the Dao almost collapsed …"
Ye Xuan suddenly turned to look at Ye Zhiming, "Is Qing 'er resisting some kind of Great Dao?"
Ye Zhiming was silent for a moment, then said, "I don't know!"
Ye Xuan was silent for a long time, then said softly, "Whatever!
When I see Qing 'er in the future, I'll ask her to worship me. I want to see how strong the God's Seal that Qing' er worships is.
Hehe … "
Ye Zhiming looked at Ye Xuan with a strange expression.
This guy can't really do that, right?
If the plain-dressed woman believes in Ye Xuan's God's Cause …
....









Chapter 1309
Ye Xuan put away the god's seal and looked at Meng Po. At this moment, Meng Po was getting weaker and weaker.
Ye Xuan did not pity Meng Po. He did not forget that she was here to kill him.
Meng Po looked at Ye Xuan and smiled, "Do it!"
Ye Xuan shook his head and smiled, "Senior, why do you think I want to kill you?"
Meng Po smiled, "To prevent future troubles!"
Ye Xuan thought for a moment. Then he said, "Just go!"
Meng Po narrowed her eyes, "You won't kill me?"
Ye Xuan nodded, "I won't."
Meng Po looked at Ye Xuan, "Aren't you afraid that I will come back for revenge?"
Ye Xuan smiled, "You didn't dare to touch me even at your peak. Will you now?"
Meng Po was silent.
Ye Xuan said, "Meng Po, one last question. Do you know about the Yellow Springs Holy Water in the nether world?"
Meng Po narrowed her eyes, "You want the Yellow Springs Holy Water!"
Ye Xuan nodded, "Yes!"
Meng Po said, "You can't get it!"
Ye Xuan was puzzled, "Why?"
Meng Po said softly, "The Yellow Springs Holy Water is very helpful to the soul!
To the souls of the nether world, the Yellow Springs Holy Water is a supreme divine item. It is guarded by the lord of the nether world. It is almost impossible for an outsider to get it. "
Ye Xuan said, "Isn't the Yellow Springs Holy Water used to repair the soul?"
Meng Po nodded, "It is. No matter how damaged the soul is, the water can repair it. However, it can not only repair the soul, it can also strengthen it!
If you can get a drop of the Yellow Springs Holy Water, it is no exaggeration to say that your soul will be strengthened by at least ten times! "
Ten times!
Ye Xuan was moved. This was a little crazy!
Meng Po laughed at herself, "I have served the nether world for so many years. I have never seen the Yellow Springs Holy Water, let alone obtained it.
This kind of divine object, only the gods of the netherworld have the qualifications to obtain it. "
Ye Xuan asked, "Where is the Underworld River?"
Meng Po looked at Ye Xuan. "You want to steal it?"
Ye Xuan smiled sheepishly, "No, I just want to borrow some!"
Granny Meng shook her head. "The Yellow Springs Holy Water is in Fengdu City of the Netherworld, and this city is guarded by the Lord of the Netherworld. If you dare to step into this city, he will immediately sense it because your physical body is still here!"
Fengdu City!
Ye Xuan asked softly, "Is this Fengdu City the main city of the netherworld?"
Meng Po nodded.
Ye Xuan thought for a moment and said, "I understand."
Meng Po suddenly said, "You really won't kill me?"
Ye Xuan looked at Meng Po and smiled, "You may leave!"
Meng Po looked deeply at Ye Xuan, then turned and left.
After Meng Po left, Ye Zhiming suddenly said, "Just in case, you should have killed her!"
Ye Xuan chuckled, "Zhiming, I can kill her, but do you really think she doesn't have the ability to protect herself?"
Ye Zhiming looked at Ye Xuan. Ye Xuan said softly, "There is no fear in her eyes. If I'm not wrong, she definitely has a way to protect herself.
Not to mention anything else, as long as she makes even the slightest movement, exposing us, we will not be able to bear the consequences.
If I don't kill her, she won't be stupid enough to fight us to the death. "
Ye Zhiming nodded, "You've thought it through!"
Ye Xuan suddenly smiled, "Zhiming, do you still remember our bet?"
Hearing this, Ye Zhiming suddenly flew into a rage. She glared at Ye Xuan, wanting to hit him.
Ye Xuan smiled, "What, you want to go back on your word?"
(This chapter is not finished, please continue to the next page)
Ye Zhiming was silent.
Ye Xuan laughed, "I'm just joking with you!"
With that, he walked towards the River of Forgetfulness. At this time, Ye Zhiming suddenly appeared in front of him. She tiptoed and kissed Ye Xuan on the cheek, but the kiss soon broke off. At the same time, she retreated a few meters away, distancing herself from Ye Xuan.
Ye Xuan was stunned on the spot.
Really kissing?
Ye Zhiming looked coldly at Ye Xuan, "I lost the bet!"
Ye Xuan was about to speak when the River of Forgetfulness suddenly started trembling, and it didn't take long for a sword to emerge from within it.
Soul Suppressing Sword!
Ye Zhiming hurriedly said, "Put the sword into the Prison Pagoda, quickly!"
Ye Xuan understood the gravity of the situation and quickly put the Soul Suppressing Sword into the Prison Pagoda, because the sword's aura was too strong!
After putting the Soul Suppressing Sword into the Prison Pagoda, Ye Xuan and Ye Zhiming looked at the River of Forgetfulness. At this time, the River of Forgetfulness had been completely absorbed.
At least tens of millions of ghosts!
Ye Xuan was a little shocked, this little soul's appetite is too big!
At this time, Ye Zhiming suddenly said, "Someone is coming!
Hide! "
Ye Xuan immediately brought Ye Zhiming into the Prison Pagoda, and the Prison Pagoda concealed itself completely.
As soon as the two disappeared, a soul suddenly appeared beside the River of Forgetfulness. The soul glanced at the River of Forgetfulness and frowned, "How is this possible …"
A moment later, the soul turned around and disappeared.
At this time, Ye Xuan and Ye Zhiming appeared on the scene.
Ye Zhiming said solemnly, "The other party might have gone to report to the underworld!"
Ye Xuan nodded slightly, "Zhiming, I want to make a trip to Fengdu City!"
Ye Zhiming frowned slightly, "To get the Yellow Springs Holy Water?"
Ye Xuan nodded.
Ye Zhiming stared at Ye Xuan, "Don't be too greedy!"
Ye Xuan smiled bitterly, "To be honest, the main reason I came to the underworld this time is to get the Yellow Springs Holy Water!"
Ye Zhiming looked at Ye Xuan. "You're not proficient in the path of the soul. You didn't want the Netherworld Holy Water to strengthen your soul. You wanted it to heal your injuries. But your soul is still intact … You came here for someone else!"
Ye Xuan nodded.
After a moment of silence, Ye Zhiming suddenly looked at Ye Xuan, "You came for Mu Niannian!"
Ye Xuan nodded, "Yes!
Didn't you say that she was injured?
For an expert of her level, it is impossible for her body to be injured, but her soul must have been injured. The Yellow Springs Holy Water will definitely help her! "
Ye Zhiming looked at Ye Xuan, "Before coming to the underworld, you asked me what kind of healing holy item I had. At that time, I was still a little doubtful, so this was your goal.
And before you came here, you made a deal with Mu Sheng … If I am not wrong, you should have asked her to help you get the Yellow Springs Holy Water, and you saved Man Zhu and her sister … The reason why you did not hesitate to offend that mysterious woman, sowing evil karma, is not only because of your compassion, but also because you want the Yellow Springs Holy Water! "
Ye Xuan smiled awkwardly, "Saving the sisters is partly out of compassion, and partly out of selfishness!"
Ye Zhiming frowned slightly, "Why didn't you let her come and get it herself?"
Ye Xuan said in a low voice, "Sister Nian said that she does not want to provoke the experts of the underworld. I think the reason why she does not want to provoke the underworld is because of the Fifth Dimension, and because she is injured, she does not want to lick the boots of more opponents!"
Ye Zhiming was so angry that he laughed, "So you came to provoke them for her?
Ye Xuan, ah, Ye Xuan!
Have you ever thought about who you are?
Even she does not dare to provoke the underworld, so what right do you have to do it?
Because you have a lot of backing?
The underworld
(This chapter is not finished, please continue to the next page)
Do you know that you have backing?
Do they care about your backing?
And just now on the Yellow Springs Path, do you know that woman is a Daoting?
Not only is she a Daoting, she is also a Heavenly Deity. That woman's identity is not simple!
Just because you want the Yellow Springs Holy Water, you offended her, sowing evil karma … Aren't you very smart?
How can you be so stupid at this moment? "
Ye Xuan smiled, "If there is something wrong with your soul, I will do the same!"
"You!"
Ye Zhiming stared at Ye Xuan, angrily said, "You want to trick me again!
I will not believe you! "
Ye Xuan chuckled, "Zhiming, do you know how much Sister Nian has done for me?"
Ye Zhiming sneered, "Zhiming, do you know how much Sister Nian has done for me?"
She just wants to use you!
That woman is not as good as you think she is!
Not only her, I am also very bad, I also want to use you to fight against the power behind me, I am even worse than her! "
Ye Xuan shook his head and smiled, "Actually, I am also very bad, I am also using you!"
Ye Zhiming was silent.
Ye Xuan walked in front of Ye Zhiming and said seriously, "Sister Nian has done too much for me, I want to help her a little.
But now, I have to go to Fengdu City, the main city of the underworld, it is extremely dangerous, I can't bring you along. I have already made a deal with Mu Sheng, I will help her save someone, she will help me once, and guarantee your safety. Now, go back, she will take care of you in secret, after you leave, you can stay by her side and wait for me. "
As he spoke, he took out two Dao scriptures and placed them in Ye Zhiming's hands, "You are very concerned about Dao scriptures, although I do not know why you are so concerned about Dao scriptures, I know you want these two Dao scriptures, now, I am giving them to you!"
Ye Zhiming did not receive the Dao scriptures, she looked at Ye Xuan and sneered, "Are you going to make arrangements for your funeral?"
Ye Xuan smiled, "I will be careful, you know, I do not do things without confidence!"
As he spoke, he blinked, "Zhiming, can you tell me who you are?"
Ye Zhiming was expressionless, "Aren't you very good at guessing?
Why don't you guess! "
Ye Xuan shook his head, "You know too many things!
You give me the feeling that there is nothing you do not know, there is nothing you do not know … So, I can't guess. "
Ye Zhiming looked at the two Dao scriptures, not saying a word.
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "These two Taoist scriptures are now yours!"
As he finished speaking, he turned and left.
At this moment, Ye Zhiming suddenly said, "I will go with you!"
Ye Xuan shook his head, "No, I …"
Ye Zhiming appeared in front of Ye Xuan, she looked at Ye Xuan coldly, "You don't agree, right?
I will inform the underworld now, you will fall short at the last moment, do you want to try? "
Ye Xuan's face was filled with black lines, "Why are you like this?"
Ye Zhiming looked straight at Ye Xuan, "I will go with you!"
Ye Xuan said solemnly, "Knowing Destiny, it is very dangerous!"
Ye Zhiming was expressionless, "Don't worry, I will not die even if you die."
Ye Xuan still wanted to say something, but Ye Zhiming suddenly said, "Without my help, you will not get the Yellow Springs Holy Water, or should I say, you will die the moment you enter Fengdu City!"
Ye Xuan frowned, "Why?"
Ye Zhiming sneered, "I am not telling you!"
Ye Xuan, "…"
Ye Zhiming suddenly threw the two Dao scriptures to Ye Xuan, she glared at Ye Xuan, "Also, don't play with me, don't play tricks with me, I will not fall for it!"
As she finished speaking, she turned and left.
Ye Xuan shook his head with a smile, "What a silly girl!"
But his heart felt warm.

Chapter 1310
Along the way, Ye Zhiming was expressionless and silent.
Clearly, she was still angry.
But Ye Xuan couldn't understand why she was angry!
Ye Xuan walked to Ye Zhiming's side and Ye Zhiming glared at him, "Stay away from me!"
Ye Xuan said seriously, "Zhiming, I actually want you to come with me to Fengdu because without you, I'm blind in the nether world. But I'm afraid I'll implicate you."
Ye Zhiming looked into the distance, her eyes solemn, "The nether world is dangerous beyond your imagination.
I can only say that Mu Sheng doesn't have good intentions. Don't think that you tricked her.
At her level, her intelligence can't be low.
While you're using her, you don't know that she's also using you. "
Ye Xuan nodded, "I know!"
Ye Zhiming glanced at Ye Xuan, "You know, but you still came!"
Ye Xuan smiled, "I want the Yellow Springs Holy Water!"
Ye Zhiming sighed, his heart was filled with complicated emotions.
This guy in front of him was usually smart, but he would do stupid things at times.
Ye Xuan was about to speak when he suddenly froze.
In the next moment, he and Ye Zhiming disappeared.
Inside the Prison Pagoda.
The two looked at the Soul Quelling Sword in the first floor, their eyes filled with shock.
The shape of the Soul Suppressing Sword in front of him had already changed. Now, the Soul Suppressing Sword was completely black, as if it was condensed from black ink. And the powerful soul aura it emitted made even Ye Xuan's expression change!
Ye Xuan looked at Ye Zhiming. Ye Zhiming said solemnly, "I'm afraid this sword is about to reach the legendary 'Dao Proving' realm!"
"Dao Proving realm!"
Ye Xuan was shocked, "You mean, Little Soul is going to prove her Dao?"
Ye Zhiming nodded, "All living things in the world can prove their Dao!
Your sword has absorbed too many vengeful spirits and vengeful spirits, and many of those vengeful spirits and vengeful spirits are super cultivators. It has absorbed their memories and power … Of course, whether or not it can achieve Dao will depend on its own luck! "
Ye Xuan said in a low voice, "Knowing Destiny, have you ever seen a divine object that can prove Tao?"
Ye Zhiming said calmly, "The fan in the mysterious woman's hand is it!"
Ye Xuan took out the green-robed man's sword. "What rank is this?"
Ye Zhiming glanced at Ye Xuan, "This sword has no realm."
There was no realm!
Ye Xuan said softly, "I understand!"
These swords were not within the realm. Just like their master, they were not restricted by the realm.
In this world, there were two kinds of experts: the experts of the Dao Canon and those outside of it.
The green-robed man had no Realm, and neither did the Qing'er!
Those without realms were the most ferocious!
Ye Zhiming looked at the Soul Suppressing Sword. "Give her some time. If nothing goes wrong, she should be able to prove her Dao!"
Ye Xuan shook his head and smiled. "I haven't even reached Dao Validation yet!"
At this point, he looked at Ye Zhiming. "I can also absorb death qi and Yin qi …"
Ye Zhiming looked at Ye Xuan. "Don't even think about it!
The death qi and Yin qi here are equivalent to the spiritual qi in the world of the living. If you absorb them, you will definitely alarm the super experts here! "
Ye Xuan nodded. "I understand."
Ye Zhiming looked at Ye Xuan and shook his head. "I suddenly realized that you are very effective against the underworld!
This sword is extremely effective against the soul. It can be said that if the Self Release Realm experts here fight you, they won't even be able to fight back!
Moreover, you are like a fish in water here. Although the spiritual qi here is sparse, your body can absorb Yin qi and death qi … It can be said that apart from the few Heavenly God level experts here, ordinary experts can't do anything to you! "
Ye Xuan nodded. Actually, he also wanted to absorb the Yin qi and death qi here.
(This chapter is not finished, please continue.)
Because, if he absorbed both the Death Qi and Yin Qi in the netherworld, he might be able to directly prove his Dao!
Unfortunately, he couldn't do that for now!
A moment later, Ye Xuan and Ye Zhiming left the World Prison Pagoda.
The two continued forward.
The two did not choose to fly. Flying in this place was akin to courting death!
Just as they walked out of the Bridge of Helplessness, Ye Xuan saw a platform. On the platform, there was a bronze mirror.
Ye Xuan blinked. "Zhiming, is that bronze mirror a treasure?"
Ye Zhiming glared at Ye Xuan. "Treasure your head!
That's the Home Viewing Platform! "
Ye Xuan frowned. "Home Viewing Platform?"
Ye Zhiming nodded. "It's said that this Home Viewing Platform was built by a Bodhisattva of the Buddha Realm to let the deceased put down their loved ones. On the Home Viewing Platform, one can take one last look at one's hometown and loved ones.
This is the last look. After this look, everything from the previous life will disappear like smoke. "
Ye Xuan was curious. "Is it really possible?"
Ye Zhiming nodded. "It used to be possible, but I don't know now!"
Ye Xuan looked at Ye Zhiming. "Do you want to try?"
Ye Zhiming replied indifferently, "You can try if you want!"
Ye Xuan chuckled. "Then let's try!"
With that, he stepped onto the Home Viewing Platform.
No movement!
Ye Xuan looked at Ye Zhiming. "Looks like it won't work!"
Ye Zhiming said. "Try using your Dharmic powers!"
Ye Xuan hesitated for a moment. Then, he channeled his Dharmic powers into the bronze mirror. Soon, the bronze mirror trembled violently. Then, an image appeared on the bronze mirror.
Seeing this image, Ye Xuan was stunned.
Qingcheng!
Soon, he saw the Ye Clan in the bronze mirror.
At this time, the Ye Clan had already declined, and the clan was extremely deserted. There were only a dozen or so people left, and among these dozen or so people, he saw a familiar face …
An old man. The old man who had once bullied him.
This old man was not dead yet, but he was already old and senile. Furthermore, he did not have any cultivation.
In the courtyard, the old man seemed to sense something. He suddenly turned his head and was stunned. His body gradually trembled.
At this moment, a voice suddenly came from the side. "Old fart, what are you standing there for?
Why aren't you working?
Don't you want to eat? "
The Grand Elder's body trembled. He quickly picked up a broom and started sweeping the floor.
Not far away, someone was cursing. "It's all because of this old fart who chased Young Master Ye Xuan away. Otherwise, our Ye Clan would not have fallen to this state …"
In front of the Home Viewing Platform, Ye Xuan was silent.
Qingcheng Ye Clan?
He had almost forgotten about it!
The image on the bronze mirror suddenly changed to a palace. In front of the palace's main hall, a woman in a dragon robe was looking at the sky. No one knew what she was thinking.
When he saw the woman, Ye Xuan slowly clenched his right hand.
At this moment, the woman in the dragon robe suddenly opened her right hand. In her right hand was a small wooden figurine. The wooden figurine looked exactly like Ye Xuan.
The woman gently stroked the wooden figurine. After a while, she shook her head. "A guy who doesn't recognize people after putting on his pants …"
With that, she turned and left.
Below the Home Viewing Platform, Ye Zhiming looked at Ye Xuan and sneered.
Ye Xuan's expression was a little unnatural.
At this moment, the image on the bronze mirror gradually disappeared.
After a long silence, Ye Xuan turned to Ye Zhiming. "Zhiming, do you want to come up and take a look?"
Ye Zhiming was expressionless. "You want to see my background, right?"
(This chapter is not over. Please continue to the next page.)
Ye Xuan chuckled. "Yes!"
After a moment of silence, Ye Xuan walked up to the Home Viewing Platform. Ye Xuan hurriedly infused his Buddhist power into the bronze mirror. The bronze mirror trembled slightly and soon, an image gradually formed.
Ye Zhiming looked at the bronze mirror expressionlessly.
Ye Xuan stared at the bronze mirror. Suddenly, a huge abyss appeared in the bronze mirror. The abyss looked like a bloody mouth standing between several mountains. The image was a little blurry and Ye Xuan couldn't see it clearly.
As the image gradually became clearer, a voice suddenly rang out from the bottom of the abyss. "Who dares to spy on the abyss!"
With that, a powerful force suddenly shot up to the sky.
Boom!
The image in the bronze mirror suddenly stopped.
The abyss!
Ye Xuan looked at Ye Zhiming. "Zhiming, you come from the abyss?"
Ye Zhiming nodded.
Ye Xuan asked again, "What kind of place is the abyss?"
Ye Zhiming said indifferently, "It's not a good place!"
"…" Ye Xuan was speechless.
Ye Zhiming suddenly said, "Let's go!"
With that, she walked into the distance.
Ye Xuan hurriedly followed. He glanced at Ye Zhiming. "How is the abyss compared to the underworld?"
Ye Zhiming said, "It can't compare to the underworld!"
Ye Xuan said softly, "In other words, it's stronger than the underworld now?"
Ye Zhiming nodded. "You can say that.
However, the premise is that the Bodhisattva and that person from the underworld don't interfere. If they interfere, other than the top two or three forces, no other force can stand against the underworld! "
Saying this, she glanced at Ye Xuan. "Of course, other than you, the powerful second generation!"
Ye Xuan was speechless.
Ye Zhiming said again, "I know, you're going to ask me which Bodhisattva and person I am, right?"
Ye Xuan nodded and smiled. "Zhiming knows me best!"
Ye Zhiming glanced at Ye Xuan. "The Bodhisattva is the Nanzang Bodhisattva of the Buddhist Realm. He's a very powerful Bodhisattva. He could have become a Buddha, but he didn't."
Ye Xuan was puzzled. "Why?"
Ye Zhiming said softly, "Because he once made a vow that he would not become a Buddha until all the evil spirits in hell are gone."
Hearing this, Ye Xuan's eyelids twitched. "Isn't that a little difficult?"
Ye Zhiming nodded. "It's not just a little difficult. Look, even now, the Tendo has collapsed and the evil spirits are still increasing …"
Ye Xuan suddenly said, "If I destroy the Realm of Ultimate Bliss, will this Bodhisattva come after me?"
Ye Zhiming sneered. "What do you think?"
Ye Xuan said in a low voice, "Is he really that strong?"
Ye Zhiming said calmly, "He has already attained Dao at least tens of thousands of years ago!
Moreover, his opponent was a protector of the Great Dao, which was the Great Dao of Expiation. This Great Dao of Expiation was ranked in the top thirty of the Three Thousand Great Daos. He was a genuine Heavenly God, and a top-notch one at that!
The past Lords of the Underworld have been respectful to him. Even the Daoting dare not offend him! "
Ye Xuan said in a low voice, "I'm starting to panic when you put it like that!"
Ye Zhiming sneered. "What's there to panic about?
Aren't you good at fighting?
Just beat him up! "
Ye Xuan was speechless.
Ye Zhiming continued walking forward. Ye Xuan hurriedly caught up with him and asked, "Who's that person?"
Ye Zhiming stopped and said in a low voice, "A person who once broke through Dao and regretted it. He then imprisoned himself in the eighteenth level of hell, torturing himself for the rest of his life!"
Hearing this, Ye Xuan's eyelids twitched. "F * ck, he's that cruel to himself?"
.....

Chapter 1311
Ye Zhiming nodded, "Indeed."
Ye Xuan asked, "Do you know who it is?"
Ye Zhiming shook his head, "I don't!
I only know that there's a taboo in the eighteenth level of hell, and that taboo is that mysterious person. "
Ye Xuan asked again, "What about the Lord of the Underworld?
How strong is he? "
Ye Zhiming replied softly, "I don't know. The past Lords of the Underworld have always been very mysterious, and the current one is even more so. There's almost no information about him in the world of the living."
Ye Xuan frowned, "Why so mysterious?"
Ye Zhiming shook his head, "I don't know!"
Ye Xuan fell silent.
Ye Zhiming glanced at Ye Xuan, "It's not without reason that Mu Niannian doesn't want to provoke the Underworld!
Of course, I believe that if the world knew of her strength, there wouldn't be many forces that would be willing to provoke her! "
Ye Xuan asked in a low voice, "Zhiming, even you can't see Sister Nian's true strength?"
Ye Zhiming shook his head, "I can't!
This Sister Nian of yours is too mysterious! "
Ye Xuan nodded, "She's too mysterious!
Not only is she mysterious, but she also likes to act weak! "
Act weak!
Hearing this, Ye Zhiming's mouth twitched. That woman is a little scary!
As the two spoke, they arrived at a mountain range. The mountain range was shrouded in Yin Qi, making it extremely eerie. Miserable shrieks could be heard from time to time.
Ye Xuan turned to look at Ye Zhiming, "Zhiming, this is?"
Ye Zhiming looked at the mountain range before him with a solemn expression, "This is the legendary Ferocious Dog Mountain Range!"
Ye Xuan frowned, "Ferocious Dog Mountain Range?"
Ye Zhiming nodded, "This Ferocious Dog Mountain Range is home to countless ferocious dogs from the Great Desolation Era. These dogs are known as the Ferocious Hounds, and they often feed on souls. When they consume souls, they do not devour them immediately, but eat them bit by bit. Therefore, the souls they consume are worse than death."
Ye Xuan frowned, "Their target is all souls?"
Ye Zhiming shook his head. "Not in the past. In the past, they only ate evil spirits, but now …"
Upon hearing this, Ye Xuan understood.
Now that the Great Dao had collapsed, these hyenas would probably not abide by the rules anymore!
Ye Xuan collected his thoughts. "Are we going to take a detour?"
Ye Zhiming shook his head. "This is the shortest route to Fengdu City. If we were to take a detour, it would take at least a day!"
Ye Xuan nodded. "Then let's go!"
With that, Ye Xuan and Ye Zhiming entered the Ferocious Dog Ridge. As soon as they entered the Ferocious Dog Ridge, Ye Xuan felt a piercingly cold air. At the same time, a ferocious dog suddenly appeared in front of them.
Hyena!
This hyena wasn't big, only a little bigger than an ordinary dog, but it exuded a fierce aura!
Ye Xuan looked at the hyena and said with a smile, "It can't be that it wants to bite us, right?"
Ye Zhiming said indifferently, "This dog has a spirit. It should be able to sense our strength!"
As soon as Ye Zhiming finished speaking, the hyena immediately turned around and disappeared into the wild grass.
Ye Zhiming said, "Let's go!"
With that, she and Ye Xuan walked into the distance.
Not long later, the two of them entered the vast mountain range. During this time, Ye Xuan and Ye Zhiming heard countless screams. Some of them were far away, some were close.
At this moment, Ye Xuan and Ye Zhiming came to a sudden stop. Not far away from them, there were several hyenas tearing at a man. The man was howling hysterically in pain.
The man suddenly looked at Ye Xuan and Ye Zhiming. When he saw them, the man hurriedly said, "Save me!"
Ye Xuan looked at Ye Zhiming. Ye Zhiming said indifferently, "Save me if you want to!"
Just as Ye Xuan was about to make a move, the man suddenly roared, "Hurry up and save me!"
Hearing that, Ye Xuan frowned. "Brother, isn't there something wrong with your tone?"
The man roared, "You can't just watch me die … You …"
Ye Xuan frowned deeply. This guy actually used such a matter-of-fact tone to ask for help?
The man's face suddenly turned savage. He glared at Ye Xuan with hatred. "You'll die a horrible death, you'll die a horrible death …"
Ye Xuan suddenly looked at the hyenas. "Don't bite so fast. Take it slow. Yes, start from his thighs. Yes, bite his penis. Yes, just like that …"
Ye Zhiming rolled his eyes at Ye Xuan, speechless.
In the distance, the man's soul was disappearing bit by bit. The pain made Ye Xuan's scalp go numb. This was the torture of a thousand cuts in the mortal world!
The man was cursing Ye Xuan crazily, which made him quite speechless.
Ye Xuan looked at the dying man and smiled. "Brother, it's these hyenas that are biting you. Why are you cursing me?"
The man did not reply. He was still cursing. At this moment, his mind was no longer normal.
Not long after, the man was eaten clean.
The hyenas turned to look at Ye Xuan and Ye Zhiming. They did not pounce on Ye Xuan and Ye Zhiming. Instead, they turned around and ran away.
These hyenas were able to survive until now. Their intelligence was not low.
Although the Wild Dog Ridge was their territory, it was not a place that just any ghost could eat!
As long as they sensed danger, they would immediately retreat.
Seeing the hyenas retreat, Ye Xuan shook his head. "Humans are inferior to dogs!"
Ye Zhiming said softly, "Do you think that person was stupid?"
Ye Xuan smiled. "Yes."
Ye Zhiming shook his head. "There are countless people more stupid than him in the world!
There will always be people who like to take others' help for granted.
Little do they know that no one owes anyone anything in this world. If others help you, it is a favor. You should be grateful. "
Ye Xuan smiled. "Indeed."
The two continued forward. During this time, no hyenas came to disturb them. Their journey was smooth. Just as they were about to leave the Wild Dog Ridge, Ye Zhiming suddenly stopped. She and Ye Xuan looked not too far away. Not too far away, a pack of hyenas was chasing a woman. The woman was about seventeen or eighteen years old. She wore a white dress, her hair draped over her shoulders, and her face was pale. She was a female ghost!
Seeing that the hyenas were about to catch up to the woman, Ye Xuan suddenly put his fingers together, and a tiny wisp of sword energy pierced through the air. Very soon, that tiny wisp of sword energy directly appeared behind the woman, and the pack of hyenas retreated continuously, their eyes filled with fear.
The hyenas glanced at Ye Xuan and Ye Zhiming, then turned and ran.
Ye Xuan looked at the woman not too far away. The woman was also looking at him and Ye Zhiming.
Ye Xuan sized up the woman. He had to admit that this female ghost was extremely beautiful. Her eyes were bright, and her teeth were white. She looked like someone who walked out of a painting.
Ye Xuan sighed in his heart. Are all the female ghosts of the nether world so beautiful?
The woman floated in front of Ye Xuan and Ye Zhiming. She nodded slightly, "Thank you!"
Ye Xuan smiled. "Miss, you are?"
The woman replied, "A Yin spirit."
Ye Xuan sized up the woman. She was a soul, and her soul wasn't very strong. Could she really be an ordinary Yin spirit?
That didn't make sense!
The women he met were usually very strong!
At this time, Ye Zhiming suddenly said, "Let's go!"
Ye Xuan nodded. He and Ye Zhiming left, but before they could take two steps, they suddenly turned around. The woman was following them!
It's them!
Ye Zhiming frowned. "What are you doing?"
The woman pointed in the distance. "You're going to Fengdu?"
Ye Xuan blinked. "No, we're not going to Fengdu!"
The woman shook her head. "There's a Ghost Revealing Mirror in Fengdu City. If you go like this, you'll be seen by it!"
Ye Xuan frowned. "You know we're not souls?"
The woman nodded. "You have the aura of the yang world on you!"
Ye Xuan turned to look at Ye Zhiming. "Did Mu Sheng's technique to conceal our aura from the Yang Realm lose its effect?"
Ye Zhiming shook his head. "It didn't!"
Hearing that, Ye Xuan's expression changed. He looked at the woman not far away. "Who are you?"
The woman suddenly floated in front of Ye Xuan. She looked at Ye Xuan. "Take me away!"
Ye Xuan was stunned on the spot!
Ye Zhiming looked at the woman in front of him. No one knew what he was thinking.
The woman said again. "Take me away!"
Ye Xuan tugged at Ye Zhiming. "Zhiming, open your Heavenly Eye and look at her!"
Ye Zhiming stared at the woman. "I can't see through her!
She's either an ordinary soul or she's at the same level as Mu Niannian. "
Ye Xuan fell silent.
It's most likely the second!
The woman was still looking at Ye Xuan.
Ye Xuan asked in a deep voice, "Why are you following me?"
The woman said softly. "I want to leave this place!"
Ye Xuan was still confused. "Then why did you choose me?"
The woman looked at Ye Xuan. "Maybe it's fate, or maybe it's a coincidence!"
Ye Xuan was speechless.
Ye Zhiming suddenly said, "Let's go!"
With that, she pulled Ye Xuan away.
At this moment, the woman suddenly said, "The Guardian of the Great Abyss. Perhaps this is a good karma!"
The Guardian of the Great Abyss!
Ye Zhiming stopped and turned to look at the woman. She suddenly put her fingers on her forehead. "Heavenly Eye, open!"
Chi!
Ye Zhiming's forehead suddenly split open. Then, a beam of light enveloped the woman in the distance. The woman stood motionless and did not resist.
A moment later, Ye Zhiming's eyes narrowed. "You've revealed everything about yourself!"
The woman looked at Ye Zhiming. "Woman from the Great Abyss, I have no intention of harming him. On the contrary, I shouldn't have met him here. If I'm not wrong, it's because of the Calamity Cause on him."
Ye Zhiming looked at Ye Xuan. "Do you want her to follow?"
Ye Xuan smiled. "I'll listen to you. If you want her to follow, she'll follow. If you want her to not follow, she won't follow."
Hearing this, Ye Zhiming's expression softened. It was obvious that Ye Xuan was on her side.
Ye Zhiming was silent as if thinking about something.
Ye Xuan looked at the woman. "Who are you?"
The woman shook her head. "A ghost!"
Ye Xuan sighed in a low voice. "Why can't I meet a normal woman?"
As he said this, he looked at Ye Zhiming. "I really, really don't want to fight anymore!
I want to start a harem and take all the women I meet. I believe that if I can do that, I can definitely rule over the heavens! "
At this moment, the woman suddenly said, "I'm a ghost … You can't even let ghosts go?"
Ye Zhiming sneered. "What's a ghost?
He doesn't even want to let the heavens go!
Also, that San Sheng is a rock. Who knows, he might even have designs on a rock! "
Ye Xuan was speechless.
...
PS: I forgot to ask for votes yesterday. I feel like I've lost a few thousand monthly votes … The more I think about it, the angrier I get …









Chapter 1312
Ye Xuan was speechless. I was only joking!
Ye Zhiming seems to be very angry!
At this moment, the woman not far away suddenly said, "Let me follow you. I'll bring you to Fengdu City!"
Ye Zhiming sneered, "We can go without you!"
The woman looked at Ye Zhiming, "People of the Dayuan Kingdom, you have an impure motive by following him. Why can't I follow him?"
Ye Zhiming was expressionless, "You should ask him!"
Then, she looked at Ye Xuan, "Are you going to let her follow us?"
Ye Xuan quickly said, "I told you.
I'll listen to you!
If you don't, I won't let her follow us! "
Ye Zhiming looked at the woman with provocation.
The woman thought for a moment and said, "Let me guess. All of you probably have 2 objectives for coming here. The 1st is probably for the Dao Scripture of legend, and the 2nd is probably for the Nether Springs of the Netherworld, right?"
Ye Xuan's mouth twitched. Damn, is this woman a deity?
Ye Zhiming looked at the woman, "Can you help us get the Underworld Holy Water?"
The woman shook her head, "No!"
Ye Zhiming said indifferently, "If you can't, then there's no need for you to follow us!"
The woman suddenly said, "But I know the whereabouts of the Dao Scripture."
Dao Scripture!
Ye Xuan looked at the woman, "You know the whereabouts of the Dao Scripture?"
The woman nodded, "The fifth Dao Scripture is in the Underworld, and I know where it is!"
Ye Xuan said in a deep voice, "What do you want from me?"
The woman looked at Ye Xuan, "I just want to follow you for a period of time. After a period of time, if you can't satisfy me, I'll leave!"
Ye Xuan looked at Ye Zhiming, who was silent for a long time, "Make your own decision!"
Ye Xuan smiled, "Let's go!"
Then, he pulled Ye Zhiming and left.
This woman was too mysterious. He didn't want her to follow him.
At this moment, the woman suddenly said, "We'll meet again!"
Ye Xuan turned his head and glanced at the woman. The woman was also looking at him. There was an indescribable smile on her face.
Seeing this, Ye Xuan's heart was suddenly filled with anger. He turned around and walked in front of the woman. He looked her straight in the eye. "Do you really want to follow me?"
The woman nodded.
Ye Xuan suddenly took out a drop of blood essence and passed it to the woman. "Senior, do you know what bloodline this is?"
The woman looked at the bloodline. "I don't know, but it's very strong!"
Ye Xuan asked, "Have you seen such a powerful bloodline before?"
The woman shook her head. "No!"
Ye Xuan then took out the green-robed man's sword. "Senior, do you know what sword this is?"
The woman looked at the sword and was silent for a long time. "It's not within the realm …"
Ye Xuan nodded slightly. "After that, he took out the sword of the Banished Immortal Island's Patriarch!
Senior, look at this one! "
The woman looked at Ye Xuan. "What do you want to say?"
Ye Xuan looked straight at the woman. "You can see the Calamity Cause on me, right?"
The woman nodded. "If you want to say something, you can say it directly."
Ye Xuan shook his head and smiled. "I don't mean anything else. Since Senior wants to follow me, then follow me!
If Senior needs anything, you can tell me. I'll definitely do my best to help you. "
The woman said. "I really do have a favor that I need your help with!"
The corners of Ye Xuan's mouth twitched. Damn it. Does this woman know how to be polite?
She really doesn't know how to be polite!
The woman looked at Ye Xuan. "You said it!"
Ye Xuan hesitated for a moment. "What favor?
？”
The woman said. "There's a very powerful sword in your body. Can I enter it to recuperate?
Don't worry. I won't ask for your help for free. I'll go in and recuperate! "
Soul Suppressing Sword!
Ye Xuan knew that she was talking about Soul Suppressing Sword!
So she took a liking to Soul Suppressing Sword!
Ye Xuan turned to look at Ye Zhiming. Ye Zhiming spoke softly. "You decide!"
She didn't dare to interfere in Ye Xuan's matters. It wasn't that she didn't want to, but she didn't dare!
Because her intuition told her that if she forcefully interfered, then it wouldn't get better, and it would only get worse!
After all, she didn't have Mu Niannian's formidable strength!
All she could do was let Ye Xuan make his own choice!
Ye Xuan thought for a long time before he said, "Then can you help me with something?"
The woman looked at Ye Xuan. "What?"
Ye Xuan said, "I want the Yellow Springs Holy Water!"
The woman pointed into the distance. "Go straight from here, and you'll arrive at Fengdu City after 500 kilometers. The Yellow Springs River is in a forbidden area of Fengdu City!"
The corners of Ye Xuan's mouth twitched. "I want you to help me get the Yellow Springs Holy Water!"
The woman shook her head. "I can't do that!"
Ye Xuan frowned. "Aren't you supposed to be very formidable?"
The woman spoke softly. "Besides the Lord of the Underworld personally guarding the Yellow Springs River, there are at least 5 other Dao Validation Realm experts. Besides that, there's a super grand formation there. So long as something happens in Fengdu City, the Ghost Emperors of the Underworld can immediately appear there."
Ye Xuan spoke solemnly, "Is there a huge gap in strength between me and the Lord of the Underworld?"
The woman blinked and said, "Haha …"
Ye Xuan's face darkened. "What do you mean by that!?"
The woman thought for a moment and said, "You should be able to fight a Ghost Emperor now."
Ye Xuan frowned slightly. "I'm only qualified to fight a Ghost Emperor?"
The woman spoke indifferently, "A Ghost Emperor is at least at the peak of the Dao Validation Realm!"
Ye Xuan turned to look at Ye Zhiming. Ye Zhiming nodded. "Yes."
The woman continued, "Besides the Ghost Emperors of the Underworld, there's also a King of the Underworld who's in seclusion, three Judges, and a King of Hell who rules the 18 levels of Hell … In short, there are many other experts."
Ye Xuan frowned slightly. "These people you mentioned are all at the Dao Validation Realm?"
The woman nodded. "Yes!"
Ye Xuan said solemnly, "There are so many Dao Validation Realm experts in the Underworld?"
As he spoke, he looked at Ye Zhiming.
Ye Zhiming nodded. "Actually, she didn't tell us everything. There are still some experts in the Underworld that we don't know about!
You should know what she's trying to say! "
Ye Xuan knew that the woman wanted him to give up!
Ye Xuan smiled. "It's fine. I have my own plans!"
Ye Zhiming didn't say anything.
She knew that this fellow was usually joking around, but once he got serious, even 10 bulls couldn't pull him back.
However, she wasn't particularly worried because this fellow would never do anything stupid!
Since he dared to go to Fengdu, he must have some trump card!
Ye Xuan didn't ask further and continued on his way with Ye Zhiming and the mysterious woman.
On the way, Ye Xuan glanced at the mysterious woman. "How should I address you?"
The mysterious woman replied, "You can call me Ah Yin!"
Ah Yin!
Ye Xuan nodded and was about to say something when Ye Zhiming suddenly said, "We should be at the legendary Samsara Temple!"
Ye Xuan looked into the distance. At the end of his vision, he could vaguely see a black temple.
Ye Xuan asked, "Samsara Temple?"
Ye Zhiming replied, "Samsara Temple is also known as the Reincarnation Temple. People can reincarnate here."
At the side, Ah Yin suddenly said, "This place is divided into six paths: Tendo, Asura, Human, Hell, Ghost, and Animal.
The first three are the Good Path and the last three are the Evil Path.
Reincarnating here will determine whether a person walks the Good or Evil Path based on what they did when they were alive.
But now, the Good and Evil Reincarnation Path has lost its effect. Not only is there no way to determine good or evil, even reincarnation has lost its function.
This place is in ruins and ghosts rarely come here. It's very secluded. "
Ye Xuan whispered, "I see, I thought it was because there are very few ghosts here!"
Along the way, he really didn't see many ghosts.
Not long after, the three of them arrived at the great hall. The great hall was incomparably gloomy, and it was divided into six paths that corresponded to the Heaven Path, the Asura Path, the Human Path, the Hell Path, the Ghost Path, and the Animal Path.
Ye Xuan's divine sense scanned the Samsara Temple. There were no ghosts here.
Ye Xuan suddenly asked, "Can I take this thing with me?"
Ye Zhiming's eyelids twitched. She looked at Ye Xuan, "What for?"
Ah Yin also looked at Ye Xuan, "This thing is useless because the Great Dao has disappeared. It's just a broken temple."
Ye Xuan thought for a moment, then said, "Let's go in and take a look!"
With that, he walked towards the Samsara Temple!
Behind him, Ah Yin looked at Ye Zhiming, "Has he always been this bandit?"
Ah Yin, "…"
After Ye Xuan entered the Samsara Temple, it was empty. Around the temple, there were all kinds of eerie murals.
The Underworld was really cold, not a place for people to stay.
Ye Xuan looked around, then said, "Is there anyone who wants to leave a legacy?
I'm very suitable! "
Ye Zhiming, who had just entered, almost fainted when he heard this!
So this was what this guy was planning!
Ah Yin's expression was a little strange.
Was it a mistake for him to follow this guy?
This guy was too unreliable!
Ye Xuan didn't give up when there was no response, and he said again, "Is there anyone who wants to leave a legacy?
I'm not talented, but I'm the number one genius in the Yang Realm, the number one Swordsman, the number one body cultivator. I'm invincible below First Release, and I'm invincible above First Release … "
Behind Ye Xuan, Ah Yin suddenly said, "I'm going out to calm down!"
With that, she turned around and left.
Ye Zhiming said solemnly, "I need to calm down as well!"
With that, she turned around and left.
When the two women reached the entrance of the temple, the temple suddenly trembled.
Ye Xuan was stunned when he saw this.
Behind him, the two women suddenly stopped. Ye Zhiming's eyes narrowed slightly, and there was a trace of shock in them.
She had the Heavenly Eye, and she'd looked around when she'd just entered. There was nothing here!
But now it seemed that wasn't the case.
Ah Yin, who was beside her, had a trace of doubt in her eyes. She turned to look not far away, and said softly in her heart, "No way … you really took a fancy to this thick-skinned guy …"
At this moment, Ye Xuan suddenly bowed respectfully, "Disciple greets Master!"
Ah Yin, "…"
Ye Zhiming, "…"
.....









Chapter 1313
There were many times and many things that you had to try.
How would you know if you didn't try?
How would you know if you didn't try?
In any case, you wouldn't die if you tried!
As for shame, for Ye Xuan, shame was of no use at all!
The moment you chose to be shameless was the moment you rose in life!
Right at this moment, an old man suddenly appeared in front of Ye Xuan. The old man wore a black robe and held a black mirror in his hand.
When the old man saw Ye Xuan acknowledge him as his master, he hurriedly waved his hand. "Little Brother, don't just bow to me."
Ye Xuan blinked. "Yes, Master!"
The old man was slightly speechless. He was about to speak when he seemed to notice something, and he suddenly looked at the nearby Ah Yin.
Ah Yin smiled slightly.
There was a trace of shock in the old man's eyes. "It's you!"
Ah Yin nodded.
Ye Xuan hurriedly asked, "Who is she?"
The old man hesitated for a moment, and then he looked at Ah Yin. Ah Yin smiled. "Don't worry about me!
You two talk about your own matters! "
When he heard this, the old man understood and nodded. "Yes, yes!"
As he spoke, he looked at Ye Xuan. As he looked at Ye Xuan, his expression was slightly strange. "Little Brother, you …"
Ye Xuan hurriedly walked over to Ah Yin's side. He smiled. "Miss Ah Yin and I are good friends. Since Senior knows Miss Ah Yin, then we're on the same side!
It's fine if Senior doesn't want to give me the inheritance. Really, I don't like to force things! "
The old man glanced at Ah Yin, and there was very little hesitation in his heart.
He couldn't figure out the relationship between Ye Xuan and Ah Yin!
Ye Xuan suddenly smiled. "Yin, we can't make things difficult for Senior!
Let's go! "
As he spoke, he turned and left!
Yin!
The corners of Ah Yin's mouth twitched …
The old man's expression changed drastically, and he hurriedly said, "Little Brother, please wait!"
Ye Xuan turned around to gaze at the black robed old man. The black robed old man hesitated for a moment before he said, "Young Brother, you aren't a Yin Spirit!"
Ye Xuan said seriously, "Yes!"
The black-robed elder fell silent.
Ye Xuan suddenly looked at Ah Yin. "Is this old man powerful?"
Ah Yin glanced at Ye Xuan and was about to speak when the black-robed elder beside him suddenly said proudly, "The Old Man is the Reincarnation King, the master of the Samsara Temple. He is in charge of the cycle of life and death!"
Lunhui Wang!
Ye Xuan blinked, and then he said, "Senior is a Heavenly God!"
The black-robed old man said proudly, "The Old Man is not only a God, but also a God with real power!"
Ye Xuan was speechless.
It turned out that the guardians of the Great Dao were the same as those in the secular world. Their official titles were also divided into those with power and those without.
Ye Xuan restrained his thoughts and said, "Senior, have you perished?"
The black-robed old man nodded with a downcast expression, "Yes!
The reason I left a strand of my soul here was to find an inheritor to pass down the Dao of Samsara.
Unfortunately, I haven't found a suitable candidate after so many years! "
Ye Xuan hurriedly pointed at himself, "Senior, what do you think of me?"
The black-robed old man glanced at Ye Xuan, and then he hesitated for a moment before he said, "To be honest, you aren't very suitable!
What I need is a very steady person!
Because once you obtain the God Seal of the Grand Dao of Samsara, you'll possess the ability to reincarnate. If the holder of the seal isn't steady enough, then it'll be a calamity for the people of the world! "
Ye Xuan smiled, "Actually, Senior doesn't know that others only know that I'm boastful on the outside, but they don't know that I'm actually very mature and steady on the inside."
The black-robed old man gazed at Ye Xuan, "I can't tell!"
Ye Xuan was speechless.
Ye Zhiming suddenly said, "You've actually made up your mind, right?"
The black-robed old man nodded, and then he gazed at Ye Xuan, "Little Brother, you're an extraordinary genius, but you really aren't suitable to wield the Grand Dao of Samsara. So …"
Ye Xuan hurriedly said, "Senior, how do you know that I can't if you don't let me try?"
The black-robed old man smiled bitterly, "You can't try!"
A mysterious seal suddenly appeared on the center of Ye Xuan's forehead.
The God Seal!
A trace of surprise flashed through the black-robed old man's eyes, "You …"
Ye Xuan smiled, "Senior, I'm a protector of the Grand Dao as well."
The black-robed old man spoke solemnly, "That's quite surprising to the Old Man. However, since you already possess a God Seal, then it's even more impossible for you to wield the Grand Dao of Samsara!"
Ye Xuan was puzzled, "Why?"
The black-robed old man said, "Because a person can only protect a single Grand Dao!"
Ye Xuan thought for a moment, and then he smiled, "Fine!
I won't force it! "
As soon as he finished speaking, he turned to look at Ah Yin and smiled, "Let's go!"
Ah Yin gazed at Ye Xuan, "Are you really not going to force it?"
Ye Xuan smiled, "I thought about it and decided not to!
After all, I might become a Dao Breaker in the future as well! "
A Dao Breaker!
Ah Yin's eyes immediately narrowed while the black-robed old man's face became slightly gloomy.
A Dao Breaker!
That's their mortal enemy!
Meanwhile, Ye Zhiming spoke abruptly, "I support you!
With your natural talent, wouldn't it be extremely easy for you to break through the Dao in the future? "
As soon as she finished speaking, she pulled Ye Xuan along and left.
A protector of the Grand Dao?
No!
She hoped that Ye Xuan would become a Dao Breaker instead.
The current Daoting and the 3,000 Grand Daos were in chaos, and she didn't want Ye Xuan to be swept into it.
Granny Meng's God Seal could only be considered as a Xiao Dao, but Lunhui King's Dao wasn't a Xiao Dao, it was a true Grand Dao.
Moreover, it was a Grand Dao with real power!
Once Ye Xuan obtained the inheritance of this Grand Dao, he would be completely swept into the disputes of the Daoting, and he might even become the enemy of the Dao Breakers.
How did Lunhui King die?
Ye Xuan didn't know, but she did!
Lunhui King had been beaten to death, and the current Dao of Reincarnation had actually collapsed, and it wasn't a complete Dao.
It wouldn't be entirely a good thing if Ye Xuan accepted the inheritance of the Dao of Reincarnation!
Just as Ye Zhiming was leaving with Ye Xuan, Ah Yin suddenly gazed at the black-robed old man, "Perhaps you should consider it!"
"This …."
The black-robed old man was in a difficult position.
Ah Yin chuckled, "I really should consider it!"
Her smile was a little strange.
The black-robed old man hurriedly said, "Young brother, please wait!"
Ye Xuan stopped and turned to look at the black-robed old man. The black-robed old man spoke solemnly, "Young brother, to tell you the truth, I knew as soon as I saw you that you're the person I've been waiting for many years!"
Ye Xuan blinked, "Senior, didn't you say that I'm not suitable?"
The black-robed old man smiled embarrassedly, "Young brother, I think you're very suitable, really!"
Ye Xuan glanced at Ah Yin and smiled, "Senior, did you suddenly change your mind because of Miss Ah Yin?"
The black-robed old man nodded, "Yes!"
Ye Xuan looked at Ah Yin and smiled, "Looks like Miss Ah Yin isn't as simple as I thought!"
Ah Yin chuckled, "The Dao of Reincarnation is ranked in the top 10 of the 3,000 Great Daos. Although it's not a complete Great Dao, it's at least in the top 30. If you obtain the inheritance of the Great Dao of Reincarnation and become the guardian of the Great Dao of Reincarnation, you'll obtain the Art of Reincarnation, and you'll be able to control the Great Dao of Reincarnation with a yang-realm body. To put it simply, as long as you're strong enough, you can send a Dao Vindication expert into the reincarnation cycle with just a word. Moreover, you can choose whether to send him into the evil or good path!"
Ye Xuan fell silent.
Ah Yin looked at the black-robed old man, "Don't feel wronged. He inherits the Great Dao of Reincarnation, and he won't disgrace it. If you don't believe me, you can release the Mark of God and let him make his own choice!"
The black-robed old man hesitated, and then he silently chanted. Soon, a mark floated out from between his brows!
The Mark of God!
Ye Xuan noticed that it was a red Mark of God, different from Meng Po's. Meng Po's Mark of God was blue.
Obviously, the level was different!
After the Mark of God appeared, it suddenly appeared on top of Ye Xuan's head. The next moment, a red light directly enveloped Ye Xuan.
Ye Xuan frowned, "This is?"
Ah Yin smiled, "It's observing you!"
After a moment, the Mark of God suddenly trembled, and the red light gradually moved away from Ye Xuan.
Beside him, the black-robed old man said softly, "It seems that little brother is not suitable."
At this moment, the Mark of God suddenly turned into a red light and entered Ye Xuan's body!
Seeing this scene, the black-robed old man was stunned, "This … isn't he not suitable?
How … "
Ye Xuan was also a little confused. Just now, he felt the rejection of the Mark of God, but he didn't expect it to directly choose him.
What was going on?
Beside him, Ah Yin suddenly said, "Not suitable doesn't mean everything!"
The black-robed old man looked at Ah Yin, and Ah Yin smiled, "Just like in the secular world, many times, two people are indeed not suitable for each other, but not suitable doesn't mean they can't be together again!"
The black-robed old man frowned, "I … I don't understand!"
Beside him, Ye Zhiming suddenly said, "It's like a marriage of mutual benefit, for mutual benefit, everyone can be together!"
Saying so, she looked at Ye Xuan, "Although he is not suitable for the Reincarnation Dao, the Reincarnation Dao has chosen him, which means that the Reincarnation Dao has chosen him to use him!"
Ye Xuan, "…"
Ye Zhiming said again, "You can also use it!"
Beside him, the black-robed old man smiled bitterly, "It's very complicated!"
Ah Yin looked at the black-robed old man, "No matter what, the Reincarnation Dao has made its own choice, you can go in peace!"
The black-robed old man bowed slightly to Ah Yin, "Take care of yourself!"
As he spoke, he gazed at Ye Xuan, "Little Brother, no matter what, you're the protector of the Reincarnation Dao now. Even though you haven't been conferred a title by the Daoting, you already have real authority. Remember, enter the Reincarnation Dao. Don't let a good person enter the path of evil, and don't let an evil person enter the path of kindness."
Ye Xuan nodded slightly, "I'll be careful!"
The black-robed old man nodded, and then his figure gradually became ethereal.
Suddenly, he seemed to have thought of something, and he said, "Little Brother, I have a presumptuous request!"
Ye Xuan said, "Senior, please speak!"
The black-robed old man said, "I was killed all those years ago, and I wasn't able to enter the Reincarnation Dao. But this strand of my soul can enter the Reincarnation Dao to be reborn … Err, help me. Right, I want to enter the Reincarnation Dao of kindness!"
Ye Xuan was speechless.
.









Chapter 1314
All of them had strange expressions on their faces!
Ye Xuan was speechless as well.
This fellow had helped others reincarnate countless times, and now he wanted someone else to help him reincarnate, and he even emphasized that he should enter the Virtuous Path of Reincarnation!
Ye Xuan thought about it and said, "Senior, what should I do?"
The old man nodded. "Summon the Seal of Samsara!"
Ye Xuan nodded and summoned the Samsara Divine Seal. The black-robed old man looked at the Samsara Divine Seal with a complicated look in his eyes. "Farewell, old friend!"
He looked at Ye Xuan. "Activate its power and open the Virtuous Path of Reincarnation!"
Ye Xuan nodded. He tried to sense the Samsara Divine Seal. Very soon, the Samsara Divine Seal began to tremble slowly. Suddenly, the Samsara Divine Seal erupted with a brilliant green light. The green light was like a door standing in front of everyone!
The Virtuous Path!
The old man looked at Ye Xuan. "You have to use the power of this seal more often!
As for how to use it, you can ask Senior Yin next to you! "
After saying that, he directly jumped into the door.
Bang!
The black-robed old man disappeared.
Ye Xuan put away the Seal of Samsara, and then he looked at Ah Yin. "Has he reincarnated?"
Ah Yin nodded. "Yes!"
Ye Xuan asked solemnly, "Does he still have his memories?"
Ah Yin shook his head. "No!"
Ye Xuan frowned. "But I remember that he didn't drink Granny Meng's soup!"
Ah Yin chuckled. "Because his main soul has shattered, and only a strand of his soul is left. Whether this strand of soul can successfully reincarnate is a problem, let alone carry his memories!"
Ye Xuan said solemnly, "If a friend by my side perishes, can I let them use the Seal of Samsara to reincarnate?"
Ah Yin looked at Ye Xuan. "In theory, yes, but I advise you not to do that!"
Ye Xuan was puzzled. "Why?"
Ah Yin smiled and said, "This thing controls the order of reincarnation, and it is particular about fairness and justice. If you use it for yourself, it will leave you!
Moreover, even if you want to use it in this way, your friends must die a normal death. To put it simply, don't let their souls be destroyed. If their souls are destroyed or erased, then they won't be able to enter the cycle of reincarnation! "
Ye Xuan nodded. "I understand!"
Ah Yin nodded slightly. "Do you want to learn how to control the Samsara Seal now?"
Ye Xuan laughed and said, "Of course!"
Ah Yin nodded. "Then we'll stay here for half a day!
Half a day should be enough for you! "
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "Thank you very much!"
Then, he sat cross-legged on the ground. At this time, Ah Yin pointed at the space between Ye Xuan's brows. Soon, countless information flowed into Ye Xuan's brain.
Reincarnation Divine Art!
This Reincarnation Divine Art originated from the Reincarnation Great Dao. It was one of the 3,000 Dao techniques and belonged to the category of supernatural powers. Therefore, it could not be compared to Dao scriptures and martial arts.
However, Ye Xuan discovered that this Reincarnation Divine Art was truly heaven-defying. It had three major uses. The first was that the Reincarnation Great Dao could directly help him reach the peak of the Dao Validation realm. The second was that he could use the Reincarnation Divine Art to open the Good and Evil Reincarnation Path. Once this art was used, even a Dao Validation expert would not be able to resist it. Of course, this depended on one's own strength. If one was strong enough, this Reincarnation Divine Art had almost no limit!
In theory, anyone could be sent to the Evil Path of Samsara!
However, this was not possible now because the Reincarnation Great Dao had collapsed. The Reincarnation Great Dao's spirit was actually in a deep sleep because it had been seriously injured. Although it did not die directly, it had fallen into a deep sleep.
Now, the Reincarnation Divine Art was only left with its instinctive consciousness. Its true spiritual intelligence was still in a deep sleep.
Although the Reincarnation Spirit was in a deep slumber, its usefulness could not be underestimated. The Reincarnation Divine Art was not something that an ordinary person could block. This was especially true against spirits, as it had an innate restraining effect.
It could be said that the power of the Reincarnation Divine Art had increased by at least several times in the face of this Reincarnation Divine Art.
The third use was immunity. He was immune to all Reincarnation Divine Arts and martial arts. No Reincarnation Divine Art had any effect on him!
Ye Xuan still did not use the Reincarnation Divine Art to reach the Dao Validation realm. He did not want to use this method to reach the Dao Validation realm. This was because the Reincarnation Divine Art was a true external object. If he used it to reach the Dao Validation realm and the Reincarnation Divine Art left him in the future, then his own strength would also disappear. At that time, it would be a real pain in the ass!
Therefore, he would use the Reincarnation Divine Art, but he would not rely on it!
While Ye Xuan was cultivating, Ye Zhiming walked out of the hall and sat on the stone steps. She rested her chin on her hands and looked up at the gloomy sky. No one knew what she was thinking about.
At this moment, Ah Yin suddenly walked to Ye Zhiming's side and sat down. She smiled. "Dayuan person, you are very wary of me!"
Ye Zhiming said indifferently, "I am not wary of you, really, because I know that you do not have the ability to harm him."
She paused, then added, "I do not have that ability either!"
Ah Yin chuckled. "You mean the person behind him?"
Ye Zhiming nodded.
Ah Yin smiled, but did not speak.
Ye Zhiming looked at Ah Yin. "You are not simple to be able to hide from my Third Eye!"
Ah Yin smiled. "That is because your strength has not fully recovered. Otherwise, I would not be able to hide from you."
Ye Zhiming said in a low voice, "Why are you following him?"
Ah Yin asked, "What about you?"
Ye Zhiming said indifferently, "You should have guessed it!"
Ah Yin nodded. "Dao scripture!
You want to follow him to find the Dao scripture! "
Ye Zhiming nodded. "Yes!"
Ah Yin said softly, "Dao scripture …"
Ye Zhiming said, "There is a Dao scripture on you, right?"
Ah Yin smiled. "You guessed it wrong!
That Dao scripture is useless to me, no, I should say, unless it is the complete version of Dao scripture, it is not of much use to me! "
The complete version of Dao scripture!
Ye Zhiming said softly, "I wonder if there is any hope of collecting all the Dao scriptures!"
Ah Yin said, "The people of the world of the living are fighting for the Dao scripture!"
Ye Zhiming nodded. "Many!"
Ah Yin chuckled. "I received news that the Dao stone is in his hands, right?"
Ye Zhiming looked straight at Ah Yin. "So, you are here for the Dao stone!"
Ah Yin smiled. "Don't misunderstand, San Sheng is a very good friend of mine."
Ye Zhiming was silent.
Ah Yin turned to look, then said, "I thought San Sheng had followed him here!
But I did not expect that!
However, I am even more curious about him!
For a person with the Cause of Disaster to be able to survive until now, how strong must the Dao Protector behind him be! "
Saying this, she looked at Ye Zhiming. "I know that there is a person in the world of the living who is not simple, she is the Fifth Dimension Tendo!
Have you seen her? "
Ye Zhiming nodded. "Yes!"
Ah Yin smiled. "How strong is she?"
Ye Zhiming shook his head. "I don't know!"
Ah Yin blinked. "You can't tell?"
Ye Zhiming nodded. "That woman is very scary!"
Mu Niannian was the scariest woman she had ever seen, be it in terms of strength or intelligence!
Ah Yin said softly, "I really hope I can meet her!"
Ye Zhiming looked at Ah Yin. "Who is the best fighter in the world of the dead now?"
Ah Yin thought for a moment, then said, "You're giving me a hard time!"
Ye Zhiming asked again, "Who are the best fighters in the world of the dead now?"
Ah Yin smiled. "Now it's easy to answer!
The first should be the Lord of the Dead. That person's strength had reached the legendary Dao Proving Realm tens of thousands of years ago. As for now … it's a mystery anyway.
The second is that Nanzang Bodhisattva of Buddhism. This person has great faith, great wishes, and his Dharma cultivation is unfathomable. His strength is also a big mystery!
Because I haven't seen him fight for almost ten thousand years!
The last time he fought was because of that calamity! "
Ye Zhiming was silent for a moment, then asked, "No more?"
Ah Yin continued. "There are two more. One of them imprisoned himself in the Eighteen Levels of Hell, claiming that he will suffer the cruelest torture in the world until his life ends … Unfortunately, he still has at least a hundred thousand years to live!
Moreover, even if his physical body dies, his soul can remain in this world for at least a hundred thousand years … So if he doesn't regret it, he will continue to be tortured for at least another two hundred thousand years … What a long time! "
Ye Zhiming said in a low voice, "Won't he commit suicide?"
Ah Yin shook his head. "He said that it would be too easy for him!
He won't allow himself to die so comfortably! "
Ye Zhiming frowned. "What did he do to make him treat himself like this?"
Ah Yin shook her head. "No one knows except that Nanzang guy!"
Ye Zhiming pondered for a moment, then asked again, "What about the last one?"
Ah Yin laughed and said, "That Dao Lord Green Abyss of the Dao Court is also involved in this matter. His strength is also a mystery, because he basically hasn't fought much."
Ye Zhiming was silent for a moment, then said, "They are actually the Dao Protectors of the Great Dao, right?"
Ah Yin nodded. "Yes!
They are the protectors of the former Order. "
Ye Zhiming frowned. "Then why did half of the Three Thousand Great Dao almost collapse?
Did the Daoting and these powerful Dao Protectors not do anything?
Or did they have some internal problems? "
Ah Yin said softly, "They did have some internal problems back then, but in the face of disaster, all problems are not problems. So, they worked together to eliminate all the founders of the current Order, those Dao Breakers!"
Speaking of this, she shook her head and smiled, then looked at Ye Zhiming. "People of Dayuan, have you ever seen a Dao Breaker?"
Ye Zhiming shook his head. "I've only heard of it, never seen it!"
Ah Yin smiled. "No wonder!"
Ye Zhiming frowned. "What do you mean?"
Ah Yin looked into the distance and said softly, "It's not that they don't want to stop it, but they can't … Every Dao Breaker is an existence that can destroy the world, especially those who can break the top ten Great Dao. Such people are unimaginably terrifying.
The one in the eighteenth floor of the Underworld is just an ordinary Dao Breaker, but if he wants to leave, no one in the Underworld can stop him. "
Speaking of this, she seemed to think of something and suddenly turned to look at the hall. "The Dao Protector behind him is a Dao Breaker, right?"
Ye Zhiming said, "I don't know, I haven't seen him."
Ah Yin smiled. "He should be a Dao Breaker, but I don't know what level he is at … If it's just an ordinary Dao Breaker …"
.....
PS: Everyone, tell me, who do you want to see?









Chapter 1315
Half a day later, Ye Xuan walked out of the Samsara Temple!
He looked refreshed and his face was full of smiles.
Ye Zhiming and Ah Yin looked at Ye Xuan. Ah Yin smiled. "You succeeded?"
Ye Xuan nodded. "Yes!"
Ah Yin smiled. "Congratulations, you have two types of Divine Seals. This is rare even in the Daoting."
Ye Xuan whispered, "Miss Ah Yin, I heard you talk about the Daoting before. What is this Daoting?"
Ah Yin smiled. "It's a very powerful force. Everyone in it is the Guardians of the Great Dao!"
Ye Xuan asked in a low voice, "Am I considered a Daoting now?"
Ah Yin smiled. "In theory, yes, because you are also a Guardian of the Great Dao. However, you must be conferred a title by the Daoting to be considered a Daoting.
And I heard Miss Zhiming say that you saved the Red Spider Lily on the Bridge of Helplessness. Is that right? "
Ye Xuan nodded.
Ah Yin said softly, "Then you might not become a member of the Dao Court!"
Ye Xuan asked, "That woman?"
Ah Yin smiled. "She's not an ordinary woman. She's of high status and has an important position in the Daoting. If she doesn't agree, no one will reject her."
Ye Xuan asked, "Does Miss Ah Yin know what she did?"
Ah Yin nodded. "Yes!"
Ye Xuan shook his head. "If the Daoting are all like that, I won't join them even if they beg me!"
Ah Yin looked at Ye Xuan. "That's not right!
There are good people in every force, but there are also bad people.
In the Daoting, there are some with bad intentions, but there are also many who are just. "
Ye Xuan smiled, "That's true. But Lady Ah Yin, did no one in the Daoting stop her?"
Ah Yin shook his head, "No one will offend her for a mere flower spirit!"
She paused and looked at Ye Xuan. "Except for you!"
Ye Xuan smiled. "I don't know who she is!"
Ah Yin chuckled, "The cause of evil has been set, it cannot be changed."
Ye Xuan looked at Ah Yin. "Miss Ah Yin, are you also a Dao Protector?"
Ah Yin shook his head. "I'm not, but I'm in the Daoting Circle."
Daoting!
Ye Xuan pondered for a moment before he said, "Let's go!"
He didn't forget that he was here for the Yellow Spring Holy Water!
The three continued on their way.
On the way, Ah Yin pointed into the distance. "A hundred li ahead is the lotus sacred platform!"
Ye Xuan was curious. "Lotus sacred platform?"
Ye Zhiming suddenly said, "That's Nanzang Bodhisattva's place of worship, it specializes in releasing souls from purgatory."
Nanzang Bodhisattva!
Ye Xuan's eyelids twitched. He looked around and said, "Why don't we take a detour?"
Ah Yin looked at Ye Xuan and smiled. "I heard you destroyed the Realm of Pure Bliss!"
Ye Xuan blinked. "Let's take a detour!"
Ah Yin shook her head. "If we take a detour from here, we'll have to cross Golden Chicken Mountain. It'll take more time to reach Fengdu City!"
She looked at Ye Xuan and smiled. "Don't worry about that Nanzang Bodhisattva. It's been a long time since Nanzang Bodhisattva has appeared to release souls from purgatory."
Ye Xuan was puzzled. "Why?"
Ah Yin spoke softly. "The order of reincarnation has fallen into chaos. Coupled with the fact that not many souls have come to the netherworld, Nanzang Bodhisattva hasn't appeared to release souls from purgatory. So, you don't have to worry about encountering him!"
She shook her head and smiled. "In the past, countless souls wanted to encounter Nanzang Bodhisattva. Because once they were released from purgatory by him, then no matter how great their sins were, they would be able to obtain reincarnation.
Moreover, if they were fated to obtain the blessing of his Dharma and form a good relationship with him, then their future in their next life would be limitless! "
Ye Xuan hesitated for a moment before he said, "Then let's not take a detour!"
He believed that he wouldn't be so unlucky!
The three of them continued on their way, and it didn't take long for Ye Xuan to see a lotus platform. It was 27m tall and a few meters wide.
There were a few meditation cushions before it, but they were covered in a thick layer of dust.
Moreover, the lotus platform was covered in spiderwebs, and it was obvious that it hadn't been used in a long time.
Ye Xuan glanced at the surroundings of the lotus platform, and it was completely desolate.
Ah Yin said softly, "A very long time ago, this place was extremely prosperous and bustling, and it was one of the rare holy places in the Netherworld.
Unfortunately, now …. "
Ye Xuan glanced at the lotus platform, and then he said, "Let's go!"
Ah Yin nodded.
The three of them were about to leave when a ray of Buddhist light suddenly surged out from the lotus platform. The three of them were stunned by this scene.
Ye Xuan's face darkened. Dammit! Am I really that unlucky?
Right when Ye Xuan was about to slip away, a monk in a golden kasaya suddenly appeared on the lotus platform, and there was a ray of holy Buddhist light behind the monk.
Nanzang Bodhisattva!
Ye Xuan's expression was slightly unsightly. The Nanzang Bodhisattva before him felt like a vast starry sky, and it was unfathomable.
If I were to fight him one on one, then it would be quite difficult ….
Ye Zhiming's expression was also somewhat unsightly. This Ye Xuan was too unlucky, wasn't he?
How many years had it been since this Nanzang Bodhisattva appeared?
And this guy appeared as soon as he came?
Ah Yin glanced at Nanzang Bodhisattva, and didn't speak.
Nanzang Bodhisattva looked at Ye Xuan, and there was a trace of surprise in his eyes, "The cause of calamity …"
Ye Xuan was silent.
He was thinking, should he fight or run?
Or bluff?
But this big monk didn't look like he could be bluffed!
At this time, Ah Yin suddenly put his palms together, and smiled, "Nanzang!"
Nanzang looked at Ah Yin, and he smiled, "You're here too!"
Ah Yin nodded.
Nanzang said softly, "You …"
Ah Yin smiled but didn't speak.
Nanzang smiled, "I won't ask anymore!"
Ah Yin said, "Nanzang, did you sense something?"
Nanzang looked at Ye Xuan, "Spiritual insight, are you a Buddhist disciple?"
Ye Xuan smiled, "Not really!"
Nanzang looked at Ye Xuan, "I heard that the Realm of Ultimate Bliss was destroyed by a young man, and that young man had a deep relationship with the Realm of Ultimate Bliss, was it you?"
Ye Xuan nodded, "It was me!"
Nanzang smiled, "Young man, why did you destroy the Realm of Ultimate Bliss?"
Ye Xuan said, "The Realm of Ultimate Bliss wanted to rob my study room, and kill me!"
Nanzang sighed softly, "Greed!"
Saying so, he looked at Ye Xuan, "I also felt the aura of Wu Wang on you … It seems that he didn't just pass on the Buddhist scriptures to you, he also passed on his Buddhist teachings to you!"
Ye Xuan nodded, "Yes."
Nanzang looked at Ye Xuan, "Don't you have anything you want to say to me?"
Ye Xuan thought about it, and then said, "Buddha said, revenge breeds revenge, when will it end? I think, let's just forget about this!"
Pfft!
At the side, Ye Zhiming suddenly couldn't help but laugh, but she felt that it was inappropriate, so she forcefully held it in, but it was really difficult to hold it in …
At the side, Ah Yin also shook her head, this guy destroyed the Realm of Ultimate Bliss!
But now he was telling others to forget about it!
How could his skin be so thick?
Nanzang looked at Ye Xuan, for a moment he was speechless, it was very obvious that this was the first time he met such a person!
At this time, Ye Xuan said again, "Nanzang Bodhisattva, Buddhism emphasizes fairness, is this right?"
Nanzang nodded, "Yes!"
Ye Xuan looked at Nanzang, "When I was being bullied by the Realm of Ultimate Bliss, why didn't Nanzang appear to stop them?"
Nanzang shook his head, "I haven't interfered in the matters of the living world for a long time!"
Ye Xuan asked again, "Then why is Nanzang blaming me now?
Is this fair? "
Nanzang looked at Ye Xuan, "You have killed a lot, your sins are a little heavy, I can help you transcend!"
Ye Xuan suddenly said, "Nanzang Bodhisattva, do you know about the red spider lily on the Bridge of Helplessness?"
Nanzang nodded, "I do!"
Ye Xuan smiled, "She was innocently tortured for so many lifetimes, don't her tormentors have heavy sins?
Why don't Bodhisattva help her? "
Nanzang didn't say anything.
Ye Xuan smiled, "I know, because she is strong and has an extraordinary identity, Bodhisattva doesn't dare to help her, he doesn't even dare to show mercy and save the red spider lily, right?"
Nanzang looked at him, still didn't say anything.
Ye Xuan went on, "Buddhists are particular about great kindness and compassion. But it also depends on the person to show mercy, right?"
Nanzang sighed softly, didn't say anything.
Ye Xuan still wanted to say something, but Ah Yin pulled on Ye Xuan's sleeve, but Ye Xuan couldn't stop, he continued, "Nanzang Bodhisattva, you said that if hell is not empty, you will not become a Buddha, but have you ever thought, why is hell not empty?
The problem is not in hell, but in the world of the living.
Why were there so many Dao Breakers in the past?
Because there is unfairness, and since there is unfairness, there is resistance.
Just like the Realm of Ultimate Bliss, they wanted the Dao scriptures, so they came to rob me. Bodhisattva, what do you think of their behavior? "
Ah Yin pulled on Ye Xuan's sleeve again, and Ye Xuan glared at Ah Yin, "Don't stop me, I want to continue bluffing, oh no, I want to continue!"
Saying this, he looked at Nanzang, "Buddha says that all living beings are equal, but in my opinion, they are not.
The senior who taught me Dharma said that all living beings are equal in his heart, I believe this because he has no double standards.
Nanzang Bodhisattva, you … "
On the side, Ah Yin suddenly pulled on Ye Xuan's hand, "He said he wants to help you purify some of the evil karma in you, this is a good thing for you!
Many people yearn for him to help them transcend! "
Ye Xuan blinked, "Doesn't helping me mean to kill me?"
The corners of Ah Yin's mouth twitched. "Who told you that expiation means killing you?
Haven't you heard of this saying?
When Buddha helps all living beings, he says he wants to help you purify the evil karma in you, do you understand? "
Ye Xuan looked at Ah Yin, "Why didn't you say so earlier?"
Ah Yin spread his hands, "You can't stop yourself!"
Ye Xuan was silent for a long time, then said, "What now?
I'm a bit embarrassed! "
...









Chapter 1316
At this time, Nanzang Bodhisattva suddenly smiled, "Actually, what you said is right!"
Ye Xuan looked at Nanzang Bodhisattva, Nanzang Bodhisattva said softly, "There are many unreasonable things in this world, just like what you said about the red spider lilies …"
Saying this, he sighed softly.
Ah Yin suddenly said, "Nanzang Bodhisattva, don't blame yourself, if it wasn't for you, those two would have disappeared long ago!"
Nanzang shook his head, "We all know that Daoting has done wrong, but no one is willing to stand up for it …"
Saying this, he looked at Ye Xuan, "On this point, we can't compare to you!"
Ye Xuan smiled bitterly, "Now that woman wants to take revenge on me!"
Nanzang asked, "If you were given a chance to choose again, you would still do the same, right?"
Ye Xuan nodded.
Nanzang smiled slightly, "Good!
Little brother, although you are entangled by the cause of disaster, you have a good heart, no wonder Wu Wang would pass his lifetime inheritance to you! "
Ah Yin suddenly said, "Good heart?"
Saying this, she also glanced at Ye Xuan.
Nanzang nodded, "I am not wrong!"
Ye Xuan said solemnly, "Senior, I destroyed the Realm of Ultimate Bliss, aren't you going to avenge them?"
Nanzang shook his head, "The monks of the Realm of Ultimate Bliss were greedy, they only had themselves to blame for what happened.
Moreover, as far as I know, you did not completely destroy the Realm of Ultimate Bliss, but rather, you are rebuilding it? "
Ye Xuan nodded.
Nanzang smiled, "In return, I will recite the Mahayana Diamond Sutra for you!"
Ye Xuan hurriedly said, "Can you release the cause of disaster from my body?"
Nanzang hesitated, then shook his head, "I'm afraid not!"
Ye Xuan, "…"
Nanzang smiled, "However, it can wash away some of the karma and evil thoughts from your body!"
Ye Xuan thought about it and nodded. "Thank you!"
Nanzang nodded slightly and began to silently recite the scripture. Soon, countless golden scriptures floated towards Ye Xuan. Soon, Ye Xuan was directly wrapped up by those golden scriptures, and some of the black lines around him began to slowly turn illusory!
At the side, Ye Zhiming looked at Ye Xuan, who was wrapped in scriptures, thinking about something.
Ah Yin was also quietly watching Ye Xuan and Nan Zang in front of him.
About two hours later, Nanzang stopped, and Ye Xuan was surrounded by a ball of Buddhist light.
Ye Xuan moved his muscles and bones a little. As if he had discovered something, he looked towards Nanzang. "Why do I feel so light?"
At the side, Ah Yin suddenly said, "Because some of the messy karma on you has been washed away, there is no cause and no effect, so naturally you are free.
Moreover, the Soul Expiation technique has purified your body, so there isn't a single impurity in your body right now. It'll be even easier for you to charge into the Dao Realm! "
Ye Xuan's expression shook, and he looked at Nanzang and pressed his palms together. "Thank you!"
He was quite surprised this time because he hadn't expected that Nanzang wouldn't just not cause trouble for him, he would even help him!
Nanzang gazed at Ye Xuan. "Little Brother, I've always believed that good will be rewarded with good, and evil will be repaid with evil!
The Buddhas seized your scriptures, so it's understandable that you killed them. On the other hand, you left behind the Buddhist Clan's inheritance and helped rebuild the Western Paradise. This is a good deed on your part, and I'm helping you today in order to repay this good deed.
After today, the enmity between you and the Buddhist Clan will be settled. What do you think? "
Ye Xuan glanced at Nanzang and nodded. "Alright!"
Nanzang nodded slightly, and then he looked at Ah Yin. "Take care!"
As soon as he finished speaking, his body turned illusory, and it didn't take long for him to vanish completely.
On the spot, Ye Xuan was silent.
Ye Zhiming suddenly looked at Ah Yin. "What would have happened if he had massacred the entire Western Paradise?"
Ah Yin smiled. "Then if he doesn't have a trump card today, he won't be able to leave this place!"
Ye Zhiming was silent.
Ah Yin said softly, "The Buddhist Clan's experts seized his study room, and this was an evil deed.
In Nanzang Bodhisattva's heart, Ye Xuan's killing of them was understandable, and the Buddhas' fate was their own fault.
However, there are many monks in the Western Paradise who study Buddhist Dharma, and these people are innocent!
Ye Xuan didn't kill them, and instead rebuilt the Western Paradise. In Nanzang Bodhisattva's heart, this is a good deed, and since it's a good deed, there should be good results.
But … "
At this point, she stopped.
Ye Xuan looked at Ah Yin. "But what?"
Ah Yin said softly, "You received the inheritance of an enlightened Buddhist monk, and that monk has some connection with Nanzang Bodhisattva. However, he didn't mention this, nor did he give you any advice. This means that he doesn't want to have too much to do with you.
Just like he said, you two are even. "
Ye Xuan smiled. "I understand!"
Ah Yin looked at Ye Xuan. "I can give you a reminder. If you leave now, go back and cultivate well, your future will be limitless.
If you … "
Ye Xuan looked at Ah Yin. "If I go back now and behave myself, will the Underworld let me go?"
Ah Yin said in a low voice, "You can hand over the Stone of Three Lives."
Hearing this, Ye Zhiming frowned. She knew that Ah Yin and the Stone of Three Lives were friends!
Ah Yin's question was undoubtedly a test for Ye Xuan, because Ye Xuan didn't know this!
Ye Xuan looked at Ah Yin and smiled. "Miss Ah Yin, San Sheng is my friend, I won't hand her over to the Underworld. I don't have the right to do so, because she isn't one of my possessions. What right do I have to make decisions for her?"
Ah Yin looked at Ye Xuan. After a moment, she smiled. "I'm relieved that she's with you!"
Ye Xuan frowned. "You're the friend San Sheng spoke of!"
Ah Yin nodded. "Yes, I'm her only friend in the Underworld, and she's my only friend.
I came to find you this time because I wanted to see who she had chosen. The reason I was able to find you is because you have her aura on you. I have been with her for over a hundred thousand years, so I am very familiar with her aura. "
Then, she turned her head and looked into the distance. "Go six hundred and sixty miles, and you'll reach Fengdu City. After you enter the city, go to the south of the city. There's a forbidden ground there, and it's the Yellow Spring River. There are at least six Dao Validation experts guarding there. It's impossible for you to enter openly."
Ye Xuan asked, "Do you have a way?"
Ah Yin nodded. She opened her palm, and there was a small stone in her hand. "This is a Soul Concealing Stone. It can hide the aura of the soul. You can use this stone to sneak into the Yellow Spring River. As for whether you can get the Yellow Spring Holy Water, it depends on your luck!"
Ye Xuan took the Soul Concealing Stone and looked at Ah Yin. "You're leaving?"
Ah Yin nodded. "I can't follow you anymore!"
Saying this, she shook her head with a smile. "I overestimated my strength!
I thought I could resist the Disaster Cause on you, but now it seems I can't.
I have a strong feeling that if I continue to follow you, I'll be done for! "
Ye Xuan was speechless.
Ah Yin continued, "Actually, it's not that Nanzang Bodhisattva didn't interfere with the Red Spider Lily you mentioned before, but it didn't work out. That woman's background is much more terrifying than you think!
As far as I know, after she found out you saved the Red Spider Lily, she was very, very angry. And when she's angry, the consequences will be very serious.
And you're going to get the Yellow Spring Holy Water … If I continue to follow you, I'm afraid it'll be hard for me to get away. So, we can only part here! "
Ye Xuan nodded with a smile. "Take care!"
Ah Yin nodded. "If you can go back, remember to tell San Sheng for me. Tell her not to think about attacking the Underworld!
If she doesn't give up, tell her that I'm fine. I'll find time to visit her! "
Ye Xuan replied, "Alright!"
Ah Yin smiled. "Take care!"
Saying this, she turned around and floated into the distance. Before long, she completely disappeared from Ye Xuan and Ye Zhiming's sight.
On the spot, Ye Xuan fell silent.
Ye Zhiming suddenly said, "Let's go!"
Ye Xuan looked at Ye Zhiming. Ye Zhiming looked back at him coldly. "What are you trying to say?"
Ye Xuan smiled bitterly. "Zhiming, this trip to Fengdu City will be very dangerous …"
Ye Zhiming stared at Ye Xuan. "You want me to leave?"
Ye Xuan hesitated for a moment. Then he said, "You said it, not me!"
Hearing this, the corners of Ye Zhiming's mouth twitched. She shook her head and smiled. "You brat, go!"
Saying this, she walked into the distance.
Ye Xuan hurriedly followed, then said, "Zhiming, look, Nanzang is so powerful, but he doesn't want anything to do with me … And this Ah Yin, he's so mysterious, but he doesn't dare to continue following me. I know that the two of them must have sensed that I'm in danger, that's why they did that. You …"
Ye Zhiming looked at Ye Xuan. "Since you know it's dangerous, why do you still want to go to Fengdu City?"
Ye Xuan smiled. "You know that I'm actually very afraid of death, so I won't do anything that would endanger my life. I'm 90% confident in going to Fengdu City this time!"
Ye Zhiming looked at Ye Xuan. "Let me go with you!
With me around, I can help you a lot!
As for the danger, don't worry, I'm 90% confident that I'll be fine on this trip! "
Ye Xuan said in a low voice. "You're tricking me!"
Ye Zhiming sneered. "You tricked me first!"
Saying this, she walked into the distance.
In the field, Ye Xuan sighed softly, then followed her.
On the way.
"Zhiming, since when did you treat me as your friend?"
"I've never treated you as a friend!
I'm just using you! "
"You hurt me too much by saying that!"
"I'm just using you, using you to find the Dao scriptures, using you to fight against the forces behind me …"
"Zhiming, why do you look like a little girl?
Can you revert to your original form?
You'll definitely be prettier if you revert to your original form, right? "
"Shut up!"
"Why don't you revert to your original form for me to see?"
"Shut up!"
"I'll just take a look …"
"Scram!"
“.....”

Chapter 1317
Fengdu City.
Fengdu City was huge and the entire city reeked of yin and death energy.
Cold!
This was Ye Xuan's first impression upon seeing Fengdu City!
He had never seen such a cold place before. The entire city reeked of yin and death energy. This was a place that no one could enter.
If not for the Death Zone, he would not be able to adapt to this place!
As if thinking of something, Ye Xuan turned to Ye Zhiming, "Zhiming, are you alright?"
Ye Zhiming shook his head, "I'm fine!"
Ye Xuan nodded. He looked at the city gate of Fengdu City, where there were many spirits floating around.
Ye Xuan asked softly, "Zhiming, are you really coming with me?"
Ye Zhiming looked at Ye Xuan, "Are you really going?"
Ye Xuan nodded.
Ye Zhiming said, "Then I'll go with you!"
Ye Xuan fell silent.
Ye Zhiming said softly, "I'm serious, I can protect myself."
Ye Xuan looked at Ye Zhiming, "You've accompanied me all the way here, it's already very kind of you!
You really don't have to risk your life with me, I'm serious. "
Ye Zhiming looked at Ye Xuan, "You're afraid of dragging me down and feeling guilty for the rest of your life, right?"
Ye Xuan nodded.
After a long silence, Ye Zhiming said, "Without my help, you won't be able to get the Yellow Springs Holy Water!"
Saying so, she walked into the distance.
After a moment of silence, Ye Xuan followed.
Using the Soul Concealing Stone that Ah Yin had given them, they successfully entered Fengdu City. After entering Fengdu City, Ye Xuan and Ye Zhiming felt uneasy!
There were too many ghosts here!
Furthermore, some of the spirits had hideous appearances and were extremely ugly to look at.
Ye Xuan looked around and found that Fengdu City was bustling.
There were tall buildings, countless hearses on the streets, and ghosts bustling about. Both sides of the street were lined with all kinds of shops …
This wasn't quite the same as what he had in mind!
Ye Zhiming suddenly said softly, "The souls here are probably unable to reincarnate, or perhaps they are ghost cultivators who are focused on cultivating their souls!"
Ye Xuan looked at the yin souls. Some of the yin souls were not weak. A few of them were even at the Return to Origin Breaking Realm Realm!
However, he did not discover any Self Release Realm cultivators!
Clearly, experts at the Self Release Realm were few and far between in the netherworld.
The two of them didn't waste any time and continued forward. Before long, Ye Xuan and Ye Zhiming arrived at the forbidden area of Fengdu City!
The Yellow Spring River!
In front of the two of them was a dense forest. Behind this dense forest was the legendary Yellow Spring River.
As soon as Ye Xuan and Ye Zhiming approached the forest, they felt several powerful auras!
This powerful aura caused the two's expressions to change!
Very strong!
Ye Xuan's expression was solemn. This place was indeed not simple!
Fortunately, he had the Soul Concealment Stone that Ah Yin had given him. Otherwise, he and Ye Zhiming wouldn't have been able to get close to this place.
As if he had thought of something, Ye Xuan looked at Ye Zhiming and sent him a voice transmission, "Enter the pagoda!"
Ye Zhiming nodded, and then he entered the Prison Pagoda.
Ye Xuan walked slowly towards the dense forest. Because of the Soul Concealment Stone, he was able to avoid the powerful auras. After entering the forest, Ye Xuan noticed that the forest was filled with all sorts of mysterious talismans. These talismans were hung all over the ancient trees, and it was very strange.
At this moment, Ye Zhiming suddenly said, "This is the Ghost Talisman Formation. It can see through all concealment techniques in the world."
Ye Xuan said solemnly, "Is it useful against my Soul Concealment Stone?"
Ye Zhiming said, "No. However, you have to be careful. Don't touch these talismans!"
Ye Xuan nodded and walked slowly towards the distance. During this time, he didn't dare to touch the talismans. He was very clear about his current situation. If he was discovered, who knew how many experts from the netherworld would besiege him!
There can't be the slightest mistake!
Ye Xuan walked slowly, and not long later, he stopped. Not far in front of him, there were many ghosts hanging. These ghosts were nailed to some mysterious ancient trees. From time to time, their bodies would flicker with lightning. Every time lightning flashed, these ghosts would let out miserable shrieks!
Ye Xuan glanced at the ghosts, and said solemnly, "These guys aren't here to steal the Yellow Springs Holy Water, are they?"
Ye Zhiming said, "They should be. The netherworld left them here to deter those who came to steal the Yellow Springs Holy Water."
Ye Xuan looked at the ghosts, and shook his head, "How tragic!"
Saying so, he continued walking.
Ye Zhiming said, "You might also be hung here!"
Ye Xuan's face darkened, "I won't!"
Ye Zhiming said, "Then be careful!"
Ye Xuan nodded, he was even more careful now.
This place is really dangerous!
I'm really on tenterhooks at every moment.
After walking for about a quarter of an hour, Ye Xuan suddenly stopped. A few dozen feet in front of him, there was an ancient tree with a bloody head hanging on it. The bloody head had flesh and skin on it, so it was not a ghost. However, Ye Xuan discovered that there was a soul imprisoned in that head.
Needless to say, this was also a prisoner, but this guy should be stronger than the ones before him.
Ye Xuan glanced at the head, and continued walking.
At this time, the head slightly raised, and looked at Ye Xuan's position!
Ye Xuan's body stiffened, and he looked at the head. The head stared back at him, and the corner of its mouth curled up into a sinister smile.
Ye Xuan was silent.
Damn it!
This person can see me?
What the hell?
Ye Zhiming said solemnly, "Get ready to run!"
Ye Xuan nodded.
But he knew that if he ran now, only death awaited him.
Ye Xuan was very calm. What kind of storm had he not been through?
Ye Xuan looked at the head, and the corner of his mouth curled up into a calm smile.
The head was slightly taken aback. Why is this guy so calm?
Ye Xuan walked in front of the head, and he sized it up. He didn't speak, very calm, and very calm.
At this time, a voice suddenly sounded in Ye Xuan's mind, "You're pretending to be calm!"
Ye Xuan suddenly took out the green-robed man's sword, and he held it in front of the head.
Seeing the sword, the head's pupils shrank, and he looked at Ye Xuan with a trace of disbelief, "This sword …"
Ye Xuan smiled, but didn't say anything.
The head looked at Ye Xuan, "You … Dao Breaker?"
Ye Xuan nodded.
The head frowned, "But I can feel that you're not very strong, you …"
Ye Xuan frowned, and the head's eyelids twitched. He didn't dare to continue.
Dao Breaker!
This kind of person is very, very scary.
Ye Xuan looked at the head, "Why are you imprisoned here?"
The head said solemnly, "Yellow Springs Holy Water!"
Ye Xuan said in a low voice, "You failed?"
The head glanced at Ye Xuan, but didn't speak.
Ye Xuan turned his head, looked into the distance, and smiled, "To tell you the truth, this Venerate came here for the Yellow Springs Holy Water."
The head suddenly said, "Are you really a Dao Breaker?"
Ye Xuan looked at the head, and frowned, "Do you want to see if this Venerate's sword is sharp?"
As he spoke, he held the sword against the forehead of the head.
The head didn't show any fear, and it gazed calmly at Ye Xuan, "Your Excellency, if this sword really is yours, then why do I feel like it isn't one with you?"
Ye Xuan fell silent.
This fellow isn't easy to fool!
Suddenly, the Sword Spirit trembled slightly, and then it transformed into a ray of blood red light that entered the space between Ye Xuan's brows.
At this moment, he was the sword, and the sword was the Venerate!
The head's expression changed when it saw this scene, and it hurriedly said, "Please forgive me if I've offended you just now!"
At this moment, he believed Ye Xuan!
In his opinion, since the sword could fuse with Ye Xuan, it was definitely Ye Xuan's sword!
Because a sword of this level would absolutely not submit to an outsider.
Of course, he hadn't imagined that Ye Xuan wasn't an outsider in the heart of the sword.
Ye Xuan's expression was calm as he sized up the head, and then he said, "How many years have you been imprisoned here?"
The head replied in a low voice, "19,000 years!"
20,000 years!
Ye Xuan's eyelids twitched. Dammit! Isn't that a little too cruel?
Ye Xuan pondered deeply for a moment and said, "How about this? I'll rescue you once I'm done!"
He wanted to pacify this fellow right now and stop it from acting rashly. Otherwise, he would really be finished once the experts of the Netherworld were drawn over!
The head hesitated for a moment before it said, "There's no need!"
A trace of surprise flashed through Ye Xuan's eyes, "Could it be that you don't want to leave?"
The head shook its head, "To tell you the truth, I already possess the ability to break open the seal within me. However, I'm waiting for them to relax a little before I escape."
As he spoke, he gazed towards the distance, "According to my observations, these experts of the Netherworld would gather during a special festival, the Ghost Festival that occurs once every 100 years. At that time, this place would become much more relaxed, and I'm prepared to escape at that time."
Ye Xuan blinked, "The Ghost Festival?"
The head nodded, "The Ghost Festival is in a month!"
Ye Xuan thought for a moment, and then he said, "Fine, then I won't force you!
Take care of yourself! "
As soon as he finished speaking, he walked towards the distance.
Meanwhile, the head suddenly said, "Senior, take care as well!"
Ye Xuan grinned, and his smile carried a strand of invincible confidence, "Don't worry, even if Nanzang, the Lord of the Netherworld, and that Daolord Qing Ming join forces, they won't be able to do anything to me!"
As soon as he finished speaking, he left in a carefree manner.
There was a trace of respect in the eyes of the head behind him ….
...
In the distance, Ye Xuan heaved a sigh of relief in his heart. Thank goodness that fellow was dealt with!
Otherwise, it would have been really dangerous!
With his current strength, it wasn't enough for him to do as he pleased in the Netherworld!
Ye Xuan took a deep breath, and then he continued forward. Around an hour later, Ye Xuan walked out of the dense forest.
Outside the dense forest, the dim view of the sky was like a sea of blood at dusk, and it was a beautiful and strange red.
Before him was a river that stretched for 150 kilometers. The river flowed with water that was dazzling like mercury, and it was pleasing to the eye at first glance.
There was a stone tablet by the river, and there were two lines of words on it:
Yellow Spring River, Yellow Spring River. At the sight of this river, Yin and Yang are separated.
Previous life?
This life?
Everything was futile.

Chapter 1318
Yellow Spring River!
This was Ye Xuan's first time seeing the Yellow Spring River. He had to admit that he was shocked.
The river water was like mercury, sparkling under the light. At a glance, it was like a galaxy.
Ye Zhiming's voice suddenly rang in Ye Xuan's mind, "The Yellow Spring Holy Water should be at the bottom of the Yellow Spring River, but you must be mentally prepared."
Ye Xuan was puzzled, "What do you mean?"
Ye Zhiming said, "Do you see the Yellow Spring River?
This water will corrode your body. I'm not sure if your body can withstand the water of the Yellow Springs! "
Ye Xuan looked at the Yellow Spring River and chuckled, "We'll know after we try!"
Then, he walked toward the Yellow Spring River.
At this moment, a powerful aura suddenly swept over the Yellow Spring River.
Ye Xuan's expression turned cold. What a powerful aura!
It seemed like there was a super expert guarding this place!
Ye Zhiming said, "That person is at least at the peak of Dao Vindication realm."
Ye Xuan nodded. The Nether World was not simple. From the looks of it, the Yang World was definitely weaker than the Nether World.
After confirming that the mysterious expert had left, Ye Xuan walked down the Yellow Spring River. However, as soon as he entered the river, he frowned and retracted his right foot.
Pain!
When he stepped in, it was like being pricked by thousands of needles. It was excruciating!
Ye Xuan was shocked. Even Self Release realm experts couldn't injure his body, but it couldn't block the Yellow Spring River!
This was a bit troublesome!
Ye Zhiming said, "The Yellow Spring Holy Water should be at the bottom of the Yellow Spring River. You can't use sword intent or other powers to force your way in. You can only go in slowly, and your body …"
Ye Xuan grinned, "It's fine. I can hold on!"
Then, he walked down the Yellow Spring River.
As soon as he entered the Yellow Spring River, Ye Xuan couldn't help but suck in a cold breath. This was too damn painful!
The Yellow Spring River couldn't destroy his body, but his body couldn't completely block the corrosive power of the Yellow Spring either.
Simply put, he wouldn't die, but he would be in great pain.
A life worse than death!
Ye Xuan clenched his fists. He took a deep breath and continued forward.
Just like that, Ye Xuan slowly walked into the distance. When he completely entered the Yellow Spring River, he truly understood what it meant to be in so much pain that he wished he was dead!
That kind of corrosive pain was really not something that a human could endure.
Most importantly, he couldn't use his power to resist the corrosive power. Otherwise, with his strength, he could use his sword intent to resist the Nether Water.
However, he couldn't do that now. If he rushed to release his sword intent now, he would be courting death.
Ye Xuan clenched his fists and quickened his pace.
Within the Prison Pagoda, Ye Zhiming watched on.
At this moment, the Ye Xuan in front of her gave her a strange feeling.
The guy in front of her usually laughed and looked very unreliable, but at this moment, she suddenly realized that this guy actually had a lot of good points.
His will was firm and he could endure what ordinary people couldn't!
She could feel the pain that Ye Xuan was experiencing. This pain was definitely worse than death by a thousand cuts.
But this guy could actually endure it!
After a long time, Ye Zhiming sighed softly.
In the Yellow Spring River, Ye Xuan slowly walked towards the depths of the Yellow Spring River. After walking for about an hour, he suddenly realized that not only was his physical body being corroded, but his soul was also being corroded!
Both his soul and physical body were being corroded!
When his soul started to be corroded, Ye Xuan's expression changed!
He could endure the corrosion of his physical body, but when his soul was being corroded, he panicked a little!
The pain of his soul being corroded was at least ten times worse than the pain of his physical body!
Ye Xuan stopped in his tracks!
At this moment, Ye Zhiming suddenly said, "Let's go back!"
Ye Xuan took a deep breath and grinned, "Since I'm already here, how can I give up halfway?"
Saying that, he continued forward.
But now, it was different. Every step he took was extremely difficult, as if it weighed a thousand tons.
It was really too painful!
His soul and physical body were being corroded, and he couldn't use his own strength to resist the corrosive force.
In this river, even the slightest fluctuation of energy would consign him to eternal damnation.
Gritting his teeth, Ye Xuan walked step by step towards the depths of the Yellow Spring River. But now, his consciousness was starting to blur.
Every time his consciousness was about to fade, he would bite the tip of his tongue, and the sharp pain would make him a little more clear-headed.
In the Prison Pagoda, Ye Zhiming asked softly, "Is it worth it?"
Ye Xuan didn't answer Ye Zhiming. He only wanted to reach the depths of the Yellow Spring River as soon as possible.
About an hour later, Ye Xuan suddenly stopped. At this moment, his face was extremely pale, and his body was trembling as if he was convulsing. But there was a trace of excitement on his face.
He had reached the end!
Not far in front of him, there was a huge runic array. In the center of the runic array, there was a small green bottle. Within the small bottle, there was a dark grey liquid.
Ye Xuan said in a trembling voice, "Zhiming, is that the Yellow Spring Holy Water?"
Ye Zhiming was silent for a moment, then said, "The liquid is dark gray, symbolizing the soul and death … This is the Yellow Spring Holy Water!"
Ye Xuan was about to go over, but as if he thought of something, he hurriedly stopped.
Formation!
There was a powerful formation at the bottom of the Yellow Spring River. Apart from the formation, he also felt a powerful aura!
There was an expert guarding it!
Damn it!
The nether world actually sent so many experts to protect the Yellow Spring Holy Water!
Ye Xuan tried to calm himself down. After a moment, he said in a low voice, "Zhiming, can you feel where that expert is?"
Ye Zhiming said, "A hundred zhang to the right!"
Ye Xuan looked to the right. A hundred zhang away, there was nothing there!
Ye Zhiming said, "He's hiding in the dark!"
Ye Xuan fell silent.
What should I do?
If I touch the Yellow Spring Holy Water, I'm sure …
I'll be discovered!
For a moment, Ye Xuan fell silent.
Ye Xuan was also silent. Ye Xuan was in a dilemma. If he wanted to take the Yellow Spring Holy Water, he would definitely alarm the experts here. If he left now, Ye Xuan would definitely be unwilling!
It really wasn't easy for him to come here!
At this time, Ye Zhiming suddenly said, "I have to make a decision!"
Ye Xuan looked at the Yellow Spring Holy Water. After a long silence, he said, "Zhiming, can you help me avoid this formation?"
Ye Zhiming was silent.
Ye Xuan smiled bitterly, "I'm too unwilling to leave now!"
Ye Zhiming said, "Give me some time!"
Ye Xuan nodded. He looked at the Yellow Spring Holy Water in the distance, thinking about something.
Roughly fifteen minutes later, Ye Zhiming suddenly said, "This is an ancient Godly Talisman Array, specifically used to imprison people. If you were to disturb it, you'll be imprisoned immediately. However, if there's no energy fluctuation, it won't be activated.
So, you only have one choice later, and that is to take the Yellow Spring Holy Water by force and immediately escape.
But doing so will alarm the experts here. If you don't have a plan, you won't be able to take the Yellow Spring Holy Water away! "
Ye Xuan nodded, "I understand!"
With that, he slowly closed his eyes, "Big Sister, can I use the Dao of Space?"
Dao of Space!
He didn't forget the Dao of Space in the pagoda. These Dao of Space were not just for show, they were just not used at the right time!
It was worth mentioning that his greatest trump card was not the Dao scriptures or martial arts, but the World Prison Pagoda!
His current body could already withstand most of the power of the World Prison Pagoda!
Moments later, Big Sister's voice suddenly resounded in Ye Xuan's mind, "Although the space here is reinforced by the formation, there are no Grand Dao Laws. So, you can use the Dao of Space to forcefully move yourself and the Yellow Spring Holy Water away.
However, I have to remind you that there are many experts here, and I'm afraid there are experts who can forcefully seal off space. Once such experts make a move, it will be very difficult for you to escape from the Netherworld! "
Ye Xuan nodded, "I understand!"
With that, he slowly walked towards the green bottle. There were at least 20 drops of Yellow Spring Holy Water in the bottle!
20 drops!
This was a sacred item that the Netherworld had accumulated for many years!
At this moment, Ye Zhiming suddenly said, "I know that you don't do things that you're not confident in. What trump card do you have?"
Ye Xuan fell silent for a moment, then he smiled, "What trump card do I have?
It's just pure guts! "
With that, the Dao of Space suddenly condensed between his eyebrows. At the moment the Dao of Space appeared, a furious shout suddenly resounded from the depths of the Yellow Spring River. "How dare you!"
As soon as the voice resounded, a powerful aura suddenly shook from the depths of the Yellow Spring River. In an instant, the entire Yellow Spring River shook violently.
At this moment, Ye Xuan and the bottle of Yellow Spring Holy Water disappeared.
Teleportation!
At the moment when Ye Xuan disappeared, an old man with a walking stick suddenly appeared where Ye Xuan was. When he saw Ye Xuan disappear, the old man was slightly stunned. In the next moment, his face turned ferocious, and he suddenly stomped his right foot, turned into a black light, and disappeared.
After Ye Xuan left the Yellow Spring River, he directly appeared in the dense forest from before. Ye Xuan was stunned. Why am I still in this forbidden area?
Meanwhile, the Big Sister said in a low voice, "There's an extremely powerful restriction in the space of this forbidden area, and the Dao of Space can't break it. So …"
Ye Xuan's face darkened. "So I can only teleport in this forbidden area?"
The Big Sister said, "Yes!"
The corners of Ye Xuan's mouth twitched. At this moment, he turned around, and his expression changed drastically in the next moment!
They've found me!
What should I do?
Ye Xuan fell silent for a moment and was about to leave when a voice resounded from the side. "Senior?"
Ye Xuan turned around and saw that it was the mysterious head he'd encountered earlier.
The head gazed at Ye Xuan and said excitedly, "Senior, did you succeed?"
Ye Xuan blinked. Then he said, "How can I fail if I attack with my own body?"
As he spoke, he took out the green bottle that contained the Yellow Spring Holy Water.
The head's face was filled with admiration. "I admire you!"
Ye Xuan suddenly said, "Do you want to kill our way out?"
The head blinked and said, "Kill our way out?"
Ye Xuan roared with laughter, "Of course we're going to kill our way out!
How about it? Do you dare to kill our way out with me? "
The head was in a difficult position. He would be able to sneak out in another month, so it would be too risky if he were to break free now!
Ye Xuan roared with laughter, "How can cultivators like us be afraid?
If you have the guts, then break free right now and kill our way out of the Netherworld with me! "
Kill our way out of the Netherworld!
The head's blood boiled when he heard that, but he was still slightly worried. "Senior, the Lord of the Netherworld …."
Ye Xuan waved his hand and smiled, "The Lord of the Netherworld is nothing!
If he dares to attack, then I'll obliterate his soul today.
I'll only ask you one thing. Do you dare to kill our way out of the Netherworld with me?
If you do, then I might even give you some good fortune! "
The head fell silent for a few breaths of time before he spoke fiercely, "Dammit! Let's do it!"
As soon as he finished speaking.
Bang!
A powerful aura suddenly burst forth from the battlefield …
.....









Chapter 1319
The head in front of Ye Xuan started to tremble violently, and it didn't take long for a body to actually grow out at a visible speed!
At this moment, the old man holding a crutch at the bottom of the river suddenly appeared not far from Ye Xuan.
Ye Xuan's eyelids twitched when he witnessed this scene, but his expression was very calm.
The old man gazed at Ye Xuan, "How interesting. A Self Release Realm cultivator actually dared to come and steal the Yellow Springs Holy Water!"
Ye Xuan glanced at the old man and smiled without saying a word!
His smile carried deep meaning.
The old man frowned slightly when he witnessed this scene. Could it be that this fellow has something to rely on?
As if he'd thought of something, he suddenly gazed at the man by Ye Xuan's side, "Wuxin, you're on his side!"
The man who'd just regrown his body roared with laughter, "Yinmu Chun, I'm on the same side as this senior!"
"Senior!"
The old man called Yinmu Chun gazed at Ye Xuan, and his brows knit together slightly, "You called him senior?"
Wuxin smiled, "Yinmu Chun, it's not too late for you to flee now. Really."
Yinmu Chun took a deep and long glance at Ye Xuan, "Who exactly are you!?"
At this moment, he felt quite fearful in his heart. Under normal circumstances, it was impossible for a Self Release Realm cultivator to come here!
Moreover, he was clearly aware of Wuxin's strength, yet Wuxin had actually called this fellow senior!
It wasn't simple at all!
Meanwhile, Wuxin stretched his body, and then he gazed at Ye Xuan and smiled, "Senior, should I kill this fellow?"
Ye Xuan glanced at Yinmu Chun, "He isn't worthy of me making a move against him!
Just kill him! "
Wuxin was stunned, and then he smiled, "Alright!"
As soon as he finished speaking, he suddenly turned around to gaze at Yinmu Chun, and then he smashed his fist forward.
His fist smashed forward, and a black fist swept forward.
Wuxin's eyes narrowed slightly. He didn't dare act carelessly in the slightest, and he tapped his walking stick forward lightly. In an instant, a black shield appeared in front of him.
Meanwhile, the fist smashed directly against the black shield.
Bang!
Along with an explosion, Yinmu Chun retreated explosively by almost 300m!
Ye Xuan glanced at Wu Xin beside him. This guy was a little fierce!
This fellow was definitely an expert at the pinnacle of the Dao Proving realm!
Wu Xin was about to attack again, but at this time, Ye Xuan suddenly said: "Let's go!"
After he finished speaking, he turned around and transformed into a sword light, disappearing into the distance.
Wu Xin stared blankly for a moment, then hurriedly followed.
Ye Xuan's speed was extremely fast. In the blink of an eye, he left the forbidden area of the Underworld. When he appeared in Fengdu City, three extremely powerful auras suddenly enveloped him.
Ye Xuan's expression darkened!
Three Self Release Realm experts!
At this time, Wu Xin suddenly appeared beside Ye Xuan. He looked at Ye Xuan and smiled, "Senior!"
Ye Xuan nodded slightly. At this time, four people appeared in front of them, two old men and two middle-aged men.
Wu Xin said solemnly, "The Four Revelations, the four old farts in charge of guarding the Yellow Spring River!"
Ye Xuan looked at Wu Xin, "Can you defeat the four of them?"
Wu Xin blinked, "Fight four?"
Ye Xuan nodded, "Of course!"
Wu Xin hesitated for a moment and then said, "I can fight two, but four … this …"
Ye Xuan nodded, "I understand!"
Wu Xin hurriedly said, "The four of them shouldn't be a match for a single sword strike from Senior, right?"
Ye Xuan smiled proudly, "How many people in this world can take a sword strike from me?"
Wu Xin felt deep veneration!
Who in this world can take a sword strike from me?
How many years has it been since I've heard such bold words?
At this moment, Yinmu Chun, who was the leader of the Four Revelations, suddenly said, "Who exactly are you!?"
In their perception, Ye Xuan was at the Self Release Realm, but they were slightly doubtful!
A Self Release Realm expert dared to be so arrogant?
It didn't make sense!
Ye Xuan glanced at Yinmu Chun, "Are you worthy of my sword?
Call the Lord of the Nether Realm out! "
Hearing this, Wu Xin, who was next to Ye Xuan, was stunned, and then he hurriedly looked at Yinmu Chun, "Yinmu Chun, hurry up and call your Lord of the Nether Realm out!
Hurry up! "
At this moment, Wu Xin's back was ramrod straight.
This thigh is thick!
The feeling of hugging a thigh is really not bad!
Opposite Ye Xuan, Yinmu Chun stared fixedly at Ye Xuan, "Someone like you is worthy of seeing my Lord of the Nether Realm?
You … "
Ye Xuan suddenly opened his palm, and the Sword Spirit appeared in his hand.
When they saw this sword, Yinmu Chun and the others' expressions changed!
They weren't sure if Ye Xuan was strong, but this sword really wasn't simple!
This was clearly a sword of the Dao Breaking realm!
Could it be that this fellow in front of them was a Dao Breaking expert?
At this thought, Yinmu Chun and the others couldn't help but turn pale.
Yinmu Chun looked at Ye Xuan, and then he hesitated, "Your Excellency … Who exactly are you?"
Ye Xuan didn't answer, and he just slowly closed his eyes, "Zhiming, take advantage of the chaos and leave with the Yellow Springs Holy Water!"
Ye Zhiming said solemnly, "What about you?"
Ye Xuan said, "I have a way to escape!"
Ye Zhiming still wanted to say something, but Ye Xuan suddenly said softly, "Please!"
Ye Zhiming said, "Alright!"
Ye Xuan looked at Yinmu Chun and smiled, "What, am I not worthy of seeing your Lord of the Nether Realm?"
Yinmu Chun said solemnly, "Your Excellency is a Dao Breaker?"
A Dao Breaker!
An expert of this level wasn't just terrifying, it was extremely terrifying. It could be said that a Dao Confirming expert was practically powerless before a Dao Breaking expert!
One was a Dao Confirming expert, the other a Dao Breaking expert. The difference between them was like the difference between the heavens and the earth!
Ye Xuan didn't speak, but Wu Xin suddenly laughed, "Of course Senior is a Dao Breaker!
Yinmu Chun, you didn't expect this, right?
Don't waste your breath!
Quickly call your Lord of the Nether Realm out and let him fight Senior! "
A Dao Breaker!
Yinmu Chun and the others' expressions became slightly unsightly when they heard Wu Xin's words.
A Dao Breaker!
Such an expert wasn't someone they could resist!
Right at this moment, a shapeless pressure suddenly smashed down from the sky. In next to no time, a middle aged man suddenly appeared above them. The middle aged man wore a white robe, and he didn't just wear a white robe, even his hair was white!
Yinmu Chun and the others bowed slightly to the middle-aged man. "Gehenna Monarch!"
Gehenna Monarch!
The Lord of Necropolis City held an extremely high position in the Nether Realm, and he only obeyed the orders of the Lord of the Nether Realm.
Gehenna Monarch looked at Ye Xuan, "You're Ye Xuan!"
Ye Xuan!
Yinmu Chun and the others' expressions became slightly unsightly when they heard Gehenna Monarch!
They naturally knew who Ye Xuan was!
Isn't he that fellow who possesses the Dao Stone?
What's he doing here?
That wasn't the main point. The main point was that they'd actually been intimidated by this fellow!
The gazes of Yinmu Chun and the others gradually turned gloomy when they thought up to this point.
On the other hand, Wu Xin who stood by Ye Xuan's side was quite stunned. What the hell?
Suddenly, Ye Xuan opened his palm, and the Pagoda appeared. At the same time, Ye Zhiming appeared as well.
Ye Xuan placed the Pagoda in Ye Zhiming's hand, "Let's go!"
"Go?"
Meanwhile, Gehenna Monarch spoke indifferently, "Ye Xuan, do you think she can leave?"
Ye Xuan smiled as he gazed at Ye Zhiming, "Let's go!"
Ye Zhiming stared at Ye Xuan, "Come back alive!"
With that, she turned around and left.
Gehenna Monarch clenched his right hand in the direction of Ye Zhiming, and a powerful Yin Soul Energy locked onto the area where Ye Zhiming was. At this moment, Ye Xuan suddenly roared, "Mu Sheng!"
Mu Sheng!
Gehenna Monarch frowned slightly. At this moment, a crack suddenly appeared in the sky, and in the next moment, a powerful force swept down from the sky.
Gehenna Monarch's expression changed, "Dao World, don't you dare!"
As soon as he finished speaking, he blasted out a punch!
Boom!
A powerful force shot into the sky, and at this moment, an afterimage suddenly appeared in the sky. The afterimage flashed down like a bolt of lightning, and in an instant, Gehenna Monarch's power was directly destroyed. At the same time, Gehenna Monarch retreated explosively for hundreds of meters.
The entire Fengdu City shook!
When Fengdu City regained its peace, Mu Sheng appeared in front of Ye Zhiming and Ye Xuan. She grabbed Ye Xuan and Ye Zhiming with both hands and soared into the sky. However, at this moment, a mysterious force suddenly swept towards them from below!
Mu Sheng frowned slightly, "Hades …"
At this moment, an afterimage rushed up from below. It was Gehenna Monarch!
The two Monarchs of the Underworld!
Ye Xuan suddenly said, "Take her and leave!"
As soon as he finished speaking, he transformed into a ray of sword light and charged down.
Below, Gehenna Monarch's eyes narrowed slightly, and he punched out to meet Ye Xuan's sword light.
Boom!
The sword light shattered, and Ye Xuan retreated explosively for nearly 300 meters!
As soon as Ye Xuan stopped, the space behind him turned into nothingness. His body had withstood this powerful force, but the space behind him couldn't!
Fortunately, Ye Zhiming and Mu Sheng had disappeared.
Gehenna Monarch looked at Ye Xuan, "Hades, go after Mu Sheng!"
As soon as he finished speaking, a Yin spirit disappeared at the end of the sky.
Gehenna Monarch looked at Ye Xuan, "I underestimated your strength!
As expected of someone who possesses the Dao Scripture and the Dao Stone. At such a young age, you actually have such ability.
However, you overestimate yourself a little!
How dare you come to my Underworld to steal the Yellow Spring Holy Water. What do you call this?
This is self-destruction. "
As soon as he finished speaking, some experts appeared around him!
A total of 10 Dao Validation experts came!
These 10 people were the 10 Ghost Emperors of the Underworld!
The battle between Mu Sheng and Gehenna Monarch just now was too big, so most of the experts of the Underworld rushed to Fengdu City.
Just now, there were no less than 15 Dao Validation experts in the field!
Ye Xuan was silent.
At this moment, Wuxin suddenly said in a trembling voice, "Senior …"
Ye Xuan looked at Wuxin, and Wuxin stared at Ye Xuan, gulping, "Senior, you're a Dao Breaker, right?"
Ye Xuan spread his hands, "I also want to be, but unfortunately, I'm not!"
"Ah!"
Wuxin suddenly collapsed, "Why do you want to harm me like this?
I can sneak out in one month!
One month!
You tricked me into killing our way out with you … I actually believed you. I'm really the biggest idiot in history. I'm an idiot, I'm an idiot!
I can't beat a dozen Dao Validation experts!
I can't beat them!
You big liar!
You goddamn liar … Ahhhhhhhhh … "
At this point, he actually wailed like a child. Although he did not cry, there was a sense of sorrow … It was very miserable.

Chapter 1320
At this moment, Wu Xin was indeed sullen!
After being trapped for more than 20,000 years, he originally had a chance to escape, but he chose to listen to this fellow's words and escaped ahead of time. Now, great!
What should he do now that the experts of the Netherworld had gathered?
What to do?
Thinking of this, Wu Xin could not help but feel sorrow in his heart.
The experts of the Netherworld revealed extremely strange expressions as well.
They naturally knew who Wu Xin was. This guy had also come to steal the Yellow Springs Holy Water in the past, but he didn't succeed. His physical body was severed by the Lord of the Underworld and he was sealed in the forbidden area, suffering the pain of the Yin wind cutting his soul.
It was just that they did not expect that this fellow could actually break the seal and escape!
All the experts of the Nether Dimension were slightly shocked because that seal was personally placed by the Lord of the Nether Dimension all those years ago.
To the side, Ye Xuan glanced at Wu Xin, who was still wailing. He couldn't bear it in his heart. "Senior, calm down first!"
Wu Xin raised his head to look at Ye Xuan. He just stared at Ye Xuan. Ye Xuan felt a little uncomfortable being stared at by him. Ye Xuan smiled awkwardly. "Senior, we can still kill our way out!"
"Kill our way out!"
Wu Xin looked at Ye Xuan and said angrily, "There are already 20 Dao Vindication cultivators here. Senior, how many are you planning to fight?"
Ye Xuan hesitated for a moment before raising a finger.
Wu Xin stared blankly. "Ten?"
Ye Xuan quickly shook his head. "One!"
Wu Xin flew into a rage. "Do you want me to fight nineteen?"
Ye Xuan thought for a moment and said, "Then I'll fight two!
You can fight eighteen of them! "
"You!"
Wu Xin angrily pointed at Ye Xuan. He was so angry that he couldn't speak.
Ye Xuan smiled bitterly, "Senior, I can only fight two at most!
Moreover, it's a little difficult to fight both of them! "
Thoughtless looked at Ye Xuan, "Big brother, my dear big brother, I don't understand. You, a Self Release Realm cultivator, came to steal the Yellow Springs Holy Water?
What right do you have to steal the Yellow Springs Holy Water?
Why? "
Ye Xuan fell silent for a moment before he said, "How bold!"
Wu Xin angrily said, "Your guts are fat, very fat. Laozi has never seen your guts so fat!
But why did you lie to me?
You want me to come out early?
Do you know that I can leave the netherworld in a month's time?! "
Ye Xuan glanced at Wu Xin and said helplessly, "I didn't plan on calling you, but you stopped me. I asked if you wanted to kill your way out, and then you agreed!"
Wu Xin said angrily: "You told me that you are a Dao Breaker, you said that no one in the Underworld is your match!"
Ye Xuan shrugged. "I was bragging!
Senior, don't tell me you've never bragged before? "
"I …"
Wu Xin was so angry that he almost died on the spot.
At this time, Ye Xuan suddenly walked in front of Wu Xin. He opened his palm, and in the center of his palm, there was a dark grey drop of water.
Yellow Springs Holy Water!
Wu Xin was stunned!
Ye Xuan said, "Senior, you have been trapped for so many years, your soul must have been seriously injured. Come, drink it."
Wu Xin looked at Ye Xuan with some uncertainty. "For me?"
Ye Xuan hurriedly said, "Don't look!
Drink it quickly! "
Wu Xin quickly took the Yellow Springs Holy Water and drank it. The moment he drank it, a powerful soul aura swept out of his body. The soul aura made the entire Fengdu City tremble.
Ye Xuan's eyelids twitched. Isn't this Yellow Springs Holy Water too abnormal?
At this moment, the surrounding Underworld powerhouses all looked at Wu Xin.
Gehenna King's gaze also fell on Wu Xin. It should be said that his focus has always been on Wu Xin.
The people of the Underworld knew little about Wu Xin's origin and strength, but they knew that Wu Xin was not ordinary. Back then, the Lord of the Underworld personally took action to suppress this guy.
Wu Xin greedily took a deep breath, clenched his fists, and in an instant, a soul fluctuation shook the surroundings.
Powerful soul power!
But at this moment, there were nearly 30 Dao Validation realm powerhouses present!
Seeing this lineup, Ye Xuan fell silent.
How can I get out?
I definitely can't beat them!
It's useless to bluff!
As if thinking of something, Ye Xuan turned to look at Wu Xin. Sensing Ye Xuan's gaze, Wu Xin immediately looked at him with an unfriendly expression. "What bad ideas are you up to now?"
Ye Xuan, "…"
At this moment, Gehenna King suddenly said, "Wu Xin, the Lord of the Underworld didn't kill you back then because he cherished talent. If you are willing to join the Underworld, all the past grievances will be settled. What do you think?"
Hearing this, Ye Xuan's eyelids twitched. He glanced at Wu Xin. Damn, this guy won't join the Underworld, will he?
Wu Xin did not answer Gehenna King. Instead, he looked at Ye Xuan and chuckled. "Are you panicking?
I'm asking you, are you panicking? "
Ye Xuan looked at Gehenna King. "Can I surrender as well?"
The corners of Wu Xin's mouth twitched. "Fuck!"
The experts of the Underworld looked at each other. Dammit, what kind of weirdo is this?
Are the people of the Yang Realm all so amusing?
Gehenna King looked at Ye Xuan and smiled. "Surrender?
That's fine too!
But you have to hand over one of your souls and one spirit! "
One soul and one spirit!
At the side, Wu Xin looked at Ye Xuan and sneered.
Handing over one soul and one spirit was equivalent to becoming someone else's dog!
If someone told you to go left, then you couldn't go right!
Ye Xuan thought for a moment and said, "Can I go back and think about it?"
As soon as he finished speaking, he turned around and ran.
Wu Xin was dumbfounded.
Ye Xuan ran very quickly because he used the Space Dao Law. In the blink of an eye, he vanished from Fengdu City.
Gehenna King was expressionless. He didn't give chase, and the experts of the Underworld didn't attack either.
Two breaths later, Ye Xuan reappeared at his original position.
Wu Xin looked at Ye Xuan and said with a smile, "Aiyo, Great Hoodwinker, why are you back again!"
Ye Xuan's expression turned a little ugly.
Dammit, there's something wrong with Fengdu City!
When he tried to use the Space Dao Law to escape this place, he realized that the space here was like a maze. So, after going around for a while, he returned here again.
There was a spatial array here!
Gehenna King looked at Ye Xuan. "Do you want to continue running?"
Ye Xuan suddenly said, "Why aren't you guys making a move? What are you waiting for?"
Gehenna King did not say anything and turned to look at the horizon.
At the intersection of the Yang Realm and the Yang Realm, Mu Sheng stopped with Ye Zhiming. Behind the two of them was a dark shadow.
Mu Sheng turned around and looked at the approaching dark shadow. "You go first!"
Ye Zhiming said in a low voice, "What about him?"
Mu Sheng was expressionless. "I only promised to help him once, and he asked me to save you!"
Ye Zhiming fell silent.
Mu Sheng looked at Ye Zhiming. "He stayed there on purpose. His hatred is too great. If he leaves with us, all the powerhouses in the Yang Realm will join forces to keep us here. Do you understand?"
Ye Zhiming did not say anything. He turned around and ran.
Mu Sheng turned to look at the dark shadow with a cold gaze. "Underworld scum!"
With that, she turned into a black light and disappeared on the spot.
Boom!
Suddenly, the intersection of the Yang Realm and the Yang Realm shook violently …
..
Fengdu City.
Gehenna King suddenly retracted his gaze and looked at Ye Xuan. "You're very capable to be able to get the Dao Realm to help you!"
Ye Xuan chuckled. "Looks like she's safe now!"
Gehenna King turned to look at Wu Xin. "What do you think of my suggestion?"
Wu Xin laughed. "If I had been willing to bow my head back then, I wouldn't have been imprisoned for 20,000 years!
As for now … If I surrender, wouldn't I have been imprisoned for 20,000 years in vain? "
At the side, Ye Xuan immediately gave him a thumbs up. "Good job, Senior!"
Wu Xin glared at Ye Xuan angrily. "Shut up!"
Ye Xuan was speechless.
Gehenna King glanced at Wu Xin and nodded. "Since that's the case, then you can die here!"
With that, he turned into a black light and charged at Wu Xin.
Wu Xin laughed. "Come on!
Let me see if you've improved over the years! "
With that, he also charged out.
The Underworld powerhouses looked at Ye Xuan. Yinmu Chun, who was the leader, suddenly said, "Kill him!"
More than twenty Dao Proving Realm powerhouses dashed towards Ye Xuan as soon as they finished speaking.
How terrifying was it when over 20 Dao Validation powerhouses attacked in unison?
However, Ye Xuan's expression was extraordinarily calm, and he slowly closed his eyes. When the Dao Validation powerhouses arrived before him, Ye Xuan suddenly opened his eyes, and the corners of his mouth curled up slightly. "Die!"
As soon as he spoke, he suddenly clenched his fists, crisscrossed his arms, and then held them horizontally in front of him.
In an instant ….
Rumble!
A destructive force suddenly erupted from Fengdu City, and the more than 20 Dao Validation Realm powerhouses who were charging at Ye Xuan were pushed back nearly 10,000 feet. Not only that, but the entire Fengdu City began to crumble.
Gehenna King and Wu Xin suddenly stopped, and then they turned to look at where Ye Xuan stood with a trace of shock in their eyes!
Gehenna King didn't attack Wu Xin again. Instead, he suddenly clenched his right hand. "Suppress!"
As soon as he spoke, countless specters condensed in Necropolis, and the city that was on the verge of shattering gradually calmed down under the suppression of the specters.
Meanwhile, Ye Xuan was nowhere to be seen!
He ran!
Gehenna King's face became ferocious. "Trying to escape?
You're dreaming! "
As soon as he finished speaking, he slowly closed his eyes, and a short moment later, he suddenly smashed his right fist towards the right.
Ye Xuan threw a punch. There was no disturbance in the space where his punch landed. However, on a hill thousands of miles away, Ye Xuan suddenly stopped. His expression changed drastically, and he raised his arms to block the attack.
Bang!
A powerful force suddenly erupted from the space in front of him, and Ye Xuan instantly retreated by over 1km!
As soon as he stopped, the space in front of him suddenly trembled, and then Gehenna King and all the experts from the Nether Dimension appeared in front of him.
Wu Xin appeared by Ye Xuan's side as well!
Gehenna King looked at Ye Xuan. "I underestimated you!"
Ye Xuan wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth, and then he looked at Wu Xin in confusion. "You're not going to escape?"
Wu Xin was expressionless. "Do you think I can escape?"
As he said this, he paused for a moment before continuing. "What was that move you used just now?
It looked very powerful! "
Ye Xuan blinked. "It's a martial art I created. It's called 'Seeking Death'!
What do you think? "
Wu Xin looked at Ye Xuan. "The name is very domineering … but are you sure you created it yourself?"
Ye Xuan nodded. "I created it myself!"
Wu Xin shook his head. "If you created it yourself, I'll eat 10kg of dung, and it'll be diluted!"
Ye Xuan was speechless.
Wu Xin suddenly said, "Kid, I don't think you're an ordinary person. Since you dared to steal the Yellow Spring Holy Water, you must have some trump card, right?"
Ye Xuan nodded. "I do!"
Wu Xin's eyes lit up. "What trump card?
Take it out and beat them to death! "
Ye Xuan looked at Wu Xin. "My helpers are in the world of the living. You help me stall them, and I'll go to the world of the living to get reinforcements. Then, I'll come back to save you. What do you think?"
Wu Xin glanced at Gehenna King and the others. He thought for a moment before saying, "I understand.
Your trump card is that you go first, and I'll bring up the rear, right? "
Ye Xuan was speechless.
.....









Chapter 1321
At this moment, there were already 36 Dao Proving experts on the hill!
36!
Some of them were the guardians of the Grand Dao.
Even Ye Xuan felt like surrendering when he saw such a lineup.
Wuxin suddenly said, "Kid, do you really not have any trump cards?"
He still thought that Ye Xuan had a trump card!
A Self Release expert coming to steal the Yellow Springs Holy Water?
This shouldn't be just guts, right?
He was gutsy in the past, but not to this extent!
"Trump card?"
King of Gehenna suddenly said with a smile, "Ye Xuan, actually, I'm also very curious. What made you dare to steal the Netherworld Holy Water?"
Ye Xuan smiled, "Gehenna King, you are the Fengdu City Lord. I heard that your strength is only second to the Lord of the Underworld."
With that, he took out the Executing Heaven Sword, "I want to spar with you!
Let's make this clear, we will fight one-on-one, fair duel, no gang fights! "
Gehenna King looked at Ye Xuan, "Challenge me?"
Ye Xuan nodded, "One-on-one!"
Gehenna King nodded, "Alright!"
With that, the surrounding Underworld experts retreated 3km away.
The Underworld believed in the strong!
Gehenna King was challenged in public, so he had to accept because it would damage his dignity, especially when the other party was only at the Self Release Realm!
Beside Ye Xuan, Wuxin glanced at Ye Xuan and then retreated to the side. He didn't choose to run because at least 10 Underworld experts had locked onto him!
Opposite Ye Xuan, Gehenna King was expressionless, "Draw your sword!"
Ye Xuan nodded and suddenly disappeared.
Gehenna King looked at Ye Xuan who was charging at him with a calm expression. He didn't look down on him because he wouldn't look down on any opponent, but he didn't pay too much attention either!
The person in front of him wasn't enough for him to pay attention to!
When Ye Xuan appeared a few dozen feet in front of Gehenna King, a divine seal appeared between his brows.
Samsara Divine Seal!
The moment the Divine Seal of Samsara appeared, Ye Xuan's aura skyrocketed!
The Dao Proving Realm!
At this moment, Ye Xuan used the Samsara God Seal and the God Seal that Granny Meng had given him to reach the Dao Vindication realm. In addition, the three domains suppressed Gehenna King. Not only that, but the World Prison Pagoda also appeared above Gehenna King's head, and nine different colored beams of light enveloped Gehenna King.
Dao Law Suppression!
Sword Domain Suppression!
Proving one's own Dao!
At this moment, Ye Xuan directly used all his trump cards!
Because he knew that he only had one chance against Gehenna King.
Slowly fight with the opponent and then reveal his trump card when the fight reaches a certain point?
That wouldn't do because he wouldn't be able to outlast him. Moreover, that would waste too much time!
What's the point of delaying a fight?
If you want to fight, then fight with your life!
At the instant that Ye Xuan utilized all his trump cards, the expressions of everyone in the surroundings had changed!
Including the King of Hell!
He hadn't imagined that Ye Xuan was actually a Guardian of the Grand Dao as well. Moreover, Ye Xuan possessed two types of God Seals!
Most importantly, Ye Xuan actually possessed three domains. Moreover, this attack of Ye Xuan's was very unusual because it had surpassed the Unrestrained Sword Heart!
At this moment, Gehenna King knew that he'd actually underestimated Chen Xi when he said he didn't underestimate Chen Xi!
He should have taken this young man seriously!
Gehenna King didn't think too much about it and suddenly roared furiously. "Myriad Yin Converge!"
At this moment, he chose to defend, and he could only defend because he'd lost the initiative to attack!
As soon as he finished speaking, boundless Yin Souls suddenly appeared around Gehenna King, and countless Yin Souls protected him!
Meanwhile, Ye Xuan's sword arrived.
This attack could be said to be Ye Xuan's strongest attack until now because he'd utilized the God Seal to temporarily improve his cultivation to the Dao Proving Realm!
His sword descended!
Bang!
Countless Yin Souls let out shrill cries as a destructive force suddenly erupted. Even though Ye Xuan's attack had annihilated countless Yin Souls, it hadn't been able to destroy Gehenna King's Yin Converge!
Gehenna King gazed at Ye Xuan and revealed a savage smile, "This is the Nether Dimension. You can't destroy my Yin Converge. Now, it's time for you to die!"
As soon as he finished speaking, he was about to attack. However, the Execution Heaven Sword in Ye Xuan's hand suddenly transformed into the Soul Suppressing Sword!
At the instant that the Soul Suppressing Sword appeared, the Yin Souls around Gehenna King were completely absorbed. At this moment, Gehenna King's expression changed drastically, "How could this be possible!?"
In the next moment, the Soul Suppressing Sword stabbed into Gehenna King's head.
Bang!
In an instant, the Yin Souls around Gehenna King were completely absorbed by the Soul Suppressing Sword. However, the Soul Suppressing Sword didn't absorb Gehenna King!
Everyone in the surroundings was dumbstruck!
Gehenna King lost?
How was this possible?
Not far away, Wuxin glanced at Ye Xuan and said softly, "This guy is too calculative."
In fact, if Ye Xuan had taken out the Soul Suppressing Sword from the beginning, Gehenna King would have been prepared. However, Ye Xuan didn't.
Ye Xuan used the Execution Heaven Sword, and when the Execution Heaven Sword failed to destroy the Yin Converge, everyone thought that Gehenna King was going to counterattack!
At that time, even Wuxin thought that Ye Xuan was finished!
Once he caught Gehenna King off guard and failed to win, he would be counterattacked!
However, no one expected that Ye Xuan would take out the Soul Suppressing Sword at this time!
The moment he took out the Soul Suppressing Sword happened to be when Gehenna King was the most relaxed. At this time, Ye Xuan won with one strike!
The Soul Suppressing Sword was suppressed inside Gehenna King's body. At this moment, Gehenna King didn't dare to move at all. If he moved, he would die!
Not far away, Ye Xuan took a deep breath. At this moment, he was very tired. That strike just now seemed to have drained all his strength!
He knew very well that he only had one chance to strike. If he couldn't win with one strike, Gehenna King would counterattack. At that time, it would be very difficult for him to win unless Gehenna King made a huge mistake!
Fortunately, Gehenna King didn't take him seriously!
Ye Xuan retracted his thoughts and put away the two God's Seals. It had to be said that the power of these two God's Seals was very tempting, but he still knew very well what he wanted!
This kind of Dao Validation was not true Dao Validation. He wanted to rely on himself to achieve true Dao Validation!
Ye Xuan looked at Gehenna King who was not far away and said with a smile, "Gehenna King, the road to the Underworld is not easy. Please send us on our way!"
Gehenna King narrowed his eyes, "You want to take me hostage?"
Ye Xuan nodded, "Yes!
Do you have a problem with that? "
Gehenna King sneered. At this moment, the Soul Suppressing Sword suddenly trembled violently. In an instant, Gehenna King's expression changed greatly because he discovered that the sword was devouring his soul!
Ye Xuan looked at Gehenna King, "If you want to die, you can kill yourself now. This way, I can't take you hostage!
Kill yourself! "
Gehenna King stared at Ye Xuan without saying a word.
Ye Xuan smiled, "It seems that you don't want to die!
Then let's go! "
After saying that, he looked at Wuxin, "Brother, let's go!"
Wuxin hesitated for a moment and then followed Ye Xuan. If he didn't follow Ye Xuan, he really wouldn't be able to leave the Underworld!
At this moment, the Underworld experts blocked in front of Ye Xuan. Ye Xuan smiled, "What, you don't care about Gehenna King's life?"
Yinmu Chun, who was the leader, glanced coldly at Ye Xuan and then looked at Gehenna King. Gehenna King was silent.
Yinmu Chun fell silent as well when he saw this.
He understood what Gehenna King meant!
Ye Xuan roared with laughter, and then he left with Gehenna King and Wuxin.
As for Yinmu Chun and the others, they didn't leave and followed closely behind.
It didn't take long for Ye Xuan's group of three to arrive at the Bridge of Helplessness. Ye Xuan took a deep breath because he was about to leave the Underworld!
But right at this moment, the Bridge of Helplessness suddenly trembled.
Ye Xuan frowned slightly. What's going on in the Underworld?
Ye Xuan looked at Gehenna King, and Gehenna King frowned as well while a trace of bewilderment appeared in his eyes.
It wasn't just Gehenna King, even the other Underworld experts were slightly bewildered because they hadn't made a move.
After all, Gehenna King's status in the Underworld played a decisive role, so they didn't dare sacrifice him. It should be said that besides the Lord of Gehenna, no one dared to sacrifice Gehenna King.
Right at this moment, Wuxin who was by Ye Xuan's side suddenly said, "Something isn't right. An expert is traversing through space and rushing over!"
Ye Xuan's brows knit together slightly, "From the Underworld?"
Wuxin shook his head, "I don't know!"
Ye Xuan was just about to speak when the space in front of him suddenly split apart, and then a woman walked out from within it.
When they saw this woman, all the experts of the Yin Dimension were stunned. In the next moment, all of them hurriedly bowed respectfully. "Sixth Princess!"
Gehenna King bowed slightly as well, and his eyes were filled with shock.
The Sixth Princess is the most beloved daughter of the Lord of Daoting. What's she doing here?
On the other hand, Ye Xuan's face sank. This woman was none other than the woman who'd imprisoned the Paramita Flower in the past.
She'd actually come here herself!
As soon as the Sixth Princess emerged, her gaze directly descended onto Ye Xuan. Her eyes were filled with indifference, and it was like a god was looking at a mortal.
Wuxin spoke in a low voice by Ye Xuan's side, "She wouldn't have come to look for trouble with you, right?"
Ye Xuan smiled, "What do you think?"
Wuxin's expression turned unsightly.
The Sixth Princess suddenly walked towards Ye Xuan, "Don't worry. I won't kill you so quickly. I'll take my time …"
At this moment, Ye Xuan suddenly drew his sword and slashed.
He who strikes first gains the advantage!
Ye Xuan still didn't hold back in this attack, and he immediately used the Samsara Seal and the three Sword Domains.
The Dao Validation Realm!
The Sword Spirit!
When the sword descended, it could destroy the world.
However, Ye Xuan's shocking attack was blocked by a ray of white light!
The ray of white light forcefully blocked Ye Xuan's sword.
A wisp of ridicule appeared on the corners of the Sixth Princess's mouth, "Kill me?
I was born with a Divine Body, and I've long since surpassed the Dao Validation Realm. Even Dao Breakers can't do anything to me, and you think you can? "
As soon as she finished speaking, she waved her right hand.
Bang!
Ye Xuan's entire body was sent flying. The moment he was sent flying, countless mysterious black thunderbolts frantically bombarded Ye Xuan …
Under the bombardment of these black thunderbolts, Ye Xuan's physical body actually began to crack inch by inch …
Beside him, Wuxin's eyes were filled with horror, "The legendary Dao Domination!"
Dao Domination!
What was above the Dao Validation?
There were two realms. One was the Dao Breaking realm. Dao Breakers were enemies of the Dao and broke the Great Dao. The other was the Dao Domination. These people could truly control the Great Dao after the Dao Validation, and such experts were as rare as the legendary Dao Breakers!
It's over!
That was the only thought left in Wuxin's mind.
....









Chapter 1322
As soon as he stopped, Ye Xuan hurriedly circulated the energy of Buddhism within him. However, his energy was actually unable to destroy the black lightning!
Ye Xuan was horrified, and he hurriedly activated his Sword Domain. At the same time, an expanse of formidable Sword Intent suddenly enveloped his body.
Bang!
The lightning was slashed into pieces by his Sword Domain and Sword Intent.
At this moment, his entire body was covered in injuries.
What formidable strength!
Ye Xuan raised his head and gazed at the Sixth Princess with a solemn expression on his face.
He's even stronger than the King of Hell!
The Sixth Princess gazed at Ye Xuan from afar, "He's not that weak. But now this is interesting!"
As soon as she finished speaking, she opened her palm, and a whip suddenly appeared there. The whip seemed to be condensed from lightning. No, it was condensed from lightning!
The Sixth Princess walked slowly towards Ye Xuan, "This is the Godstriking Whip, and it specializes in striking those with formidable bodies. I hope you'll be able to endure a few more strikes!"
As she spoke, she was about to attack. Meanwhile, Ye Xuan suddenly vanished on the spot.
Hiss!
A strand of sword light flashed through the battlefield.
A wisp of ridicule arose on the corners of the Sixth Princess' mouth. She waved her hand lightly, and then a bolt of lightning flashed.
Bang!
The lightning flickered while the heavens and the earth shook!
The bolt of lightning had just come into contact with the ray of light when it was instantly shattered. But right at this moment, Ye Xuan suddenly appeared in front of the Sixth Princess, and he stabbed his sword towards the center of the Sixth Princess' forehead!
However, the Sixth Princess didn't dodge at all, and she just allowed Ye Xuan's sword to stab towards her.
When Ye Xuan's sword was just half an inch away from the center of the Sixth Princess' forehead, it was stopped by an invisible force!
The Sixth Princess gazed at Ye Xuan and ridiculed, "Do you know what an innate divine body is?
It's because I'm protected by the gods!
Not to mention a tiny Swordsman like you, even if all the Swordsman in the world converged together, they wouldn't be able to harm me!
How can a mortal's sword harm a deity? "
With that, she suddenly lashed out with her whip. This time, Ye Xuan was already mentally prepared. The moment the Sixth Princess lashed out with her whip, he had already retreated hundreds of feet. However, as soon as he stopped, the space around him suddenly collapsed!
Boom!
Ye Xuan retreated several thousand feet, and the space he was originally in had turned into a pool of lightning!
At this moment, the Sixth Princess suddenly waved her hand, and the space in front of Ye Xuan was suddenly torn apart by a black bolt of lightning. Ye Xuan's pupils constricted, and he slashed down with his sword.
Boom!
A wave of sword radiance and lightning abruptly broke out, while Ye Xuan instantly retreated. While he was retreating, countless bolts of lightning shot towards him like flying swords.
Every bolt of lightning contained a power that could destroy heaven and earth!
It was obvious that the Sixth Princess wanted to destroy Ye Xuan's body!
After Ye Xuan stopped, he suddenly clenched his fists, and then held them horizontally in front of him.
Die!
A formidable force suddenly erupted in front of Ye Xuan!
Rumble!
In an instant, the entire hill was transformed into ash.
Moreover, the bolts of lightning had vanished!
At the same time, the experts of the Netherworld in the surroundings were shaken to the point of retreating repeatedly. However, the Sixth Princess didn't take a single step back, and the force vanished without a trace as soon as it arrived in front of her!
The Sixth Princess gazed at Ye Xuan. In the next moment, she suddenly vanished on the spot. Ye Xuan's pupils constricted, and he roared furiously, "Suppress!"
Bang!
The Sword Domain suddenly appeared in front of Ye Xuan. Meanwhile, a bolt of lightning suddenly tore through the Sword Domain, and Ye Xuan's countenance instantly turned ghastly pale!
Meanwhile, the Sixth Princess was already within Ye Xuan's Sword Domain. She laughed coldly as she suddenly clenched her right hand tightly. In an instant, countless bolts of lightning condensed in her palm.
Ye Xuan was shocked, and he hurriedly withdrew his Sword Domain. He was just about to retreat when the Sixth Princess appeared in front of him. A wisp of ridicule arose on the corners of her mouth when she noticed the trace of terror in Ye Xuan's eyes, "You finally know about space?
Aren't you …. "
Right at this moment, the Sixth Princess's voice stopped abruptly.
Because an illusory Xiao Ta had suddenly appeared above her!
The World Prison Pagoda!
Ye Xuan suddenly roared furiously, "Dao Laws, return!"
Bang!
The World Prison Pagoda shook violently. In the next moment, nine beams of energy that could obliterate the heavens and the earth suddenly erupted from within the pagoda and enveloped the Sixth Princess.
The Sixth Princess' eyes narrowed slightly, and then she suddenly relaxed her palm, causing countless bolts of lightning to shoot into the sky.
However, the bolts of lightning weren't able to shatter the energy of the World Prison Pagoda!
Above the Sixth Princess's head, a blood-red "prisoner" character gradually appeared.
A trace of uneasiness arose in the Sixth Princess' heart, and she was about to attack again. Meanwhile, Ye Xuan suddenly clenched his fists and smashed them forward!
Die!
Dao scripture martial arts!
As these two punches blasted out, a destructive force erupted from Ye Xuan's fists. However, it was blocked by a white light. However, at this moment, the white light gradually became illusory!
Because he still had the power of the Dao Laws of the Prison Pagoda!
Ye Xuan roared, "Kill!"
As soon as he finished speaking, the Sword Spirit suddenly flew out from his waist, and then it slashed down in a straight line!
The sword slashed at the white light.
Boom!
The white light instantly shattered. Ye Xuan hurriedly took a step forward and punched the Sixth Princess in the face.
Bang!
The Sixth Princess retreated immediately!
It wasn't that she didn't want to dodge that punch, but she couldn't. Because she noticed that Xiao Ta was suppressing her strength!
As she retreated, the World Prison Pagoda remained above her head. Moreover, the "prisoner" character above her head was growing redder!
God Imprisonment!
At this moment, the World Prison Pagoda and the nine Dao Laws had actually forcefully suppressed the Sixth Princess!
Of course, this was an opportunity that the Sixth Princess had given her. If she hadn't underestimated Ye Xuan, she wouldn't have been able to rely on the World Prison Pagoda at all.
Right at this moment, Ye Xuan suddenly appeared in front of the Sixth Princess, and her peerlessly beautiful face suddenly became ferocious. "Ant!"
Ye Xuan didn't punch this time, and he slashed his sword at the Sixth Princess's head instead.
Bang!
The Sixth Princess's body suddenly trembled violently, and then it became illusory. However, Ye Xuan's hair was turning white at a visible speed!
With his current strength, he was actually able to control the World Prison Pagoda. However, that depended on the person he was dealing with. The Sixth Princess's strength far exceeded his own!
It could be said that he wasn't suffering from the backlash of the World Prison Pagoda, he was suffering from the Sixth Princess's strength!
I must kill this woman!
A trace of ghastly killing intent flashed through Ye Xuan's eyes, and then he suddenly slashed his sword at the Sixth Princess once more. At the instant he swung his sword, even his body became slightly illusory!
Just as the sword was about to strike the Sixth Princess' head, a powerful force suddenly flashed across the battlefield. In the next moment, a black chess piece suddenly struck Ye Xuan's sword.
Bang!
In an instant, Ye Xuan was blasted flying along with his sword. At the same time, the energy of the nine Dao Laws that imprisoned the Sixth Princess had vanished into thin air, and the World Prison Pagoda had been heavily damaged!
The Sixth Princess had returned to normal!
Not far away, Wu Xin turned his head to look and saw a middle-aged man slowly walking over from a few hundred feet to his right. The middle-aged man wore a black robe, and on his robe, there was a picture of a malevolent ghost, and in his hand, there was a horsetail whisk.
The Netherworld Emperor!
The leader of the Ghost Emperors of the Ten Directions!
Behind the Netherworld Emperor were nine other people, and these nine people were the other Ghost Emperors of the Nine Directions!
At the side, Wuxin was silent.
At least seventy to eighty percent of the experts of the Underworld had arrived!
This time, it's really over!
Wuxin sighed softly, and he glanced at Ye Xuan in the distance. In the beginning, he had hated Ye Xuan a little, but now … this fellow's fate would probably be even worse than his!
After all, the Daoting Sixth Princess's hatred for Ye Xuan was not ordinary!
In the distance, Ye Xuan took a deep breath. This time, not only had his hair turned white, but even his face had aged.
Ye Xuan was somewhat unwilling.
He was so close just now!
Just a little bit more and he could have killed that woman!
Damn, this Underworld is playing gang fights!
At this time, Wuxin suddenly walked to Ye Xuan's side, and he looked at Ye Xuan, "You're called Ye Xuan?"
Ye Xuan looked at Wuxin, and grinned, "Sorry, I got you into trouble too!"
Wuxin shook his head, "Forget it!
I think this is fate!
Once, I also thought that I could control my own fate!
But now it seems that I didn't, otherwise, why didn't I predict that I would encounter a scammer like you? "
Ye Xuan, "…"
Wuxin also lay down beside Ye Xuan, "I also gave up resisting!
37 Dao Confirming experts, I don't want to fight, and I can't beat them! "
As he spoke, he looked at Ye Xuan, and smiled, "I may die a little easier, but it's different for you!
This Underworld isn't an ordinary place, when it comes to torturing people, it's definitely the best in the universe, you must be mentally prepared! "
Ye Xuan's face was full of black lines, "Are you gloating?"
Wuxin laughed, "To be honest, I'm still a little angry!
You really made me suffer too much! "
Ye Xuan, "…"
At this moment, the Sixth Princess suddenly appeared in front of Ye Xuan, she looked down at Ye Xuan, and was about to speak, but Ye Xuan suddenly leaped up, and under everyone's astonished gazes, Ye Xuan directly hugged the Sixth Princess, and then suddenly stabbed the Sixth Princess from the back. This sword, he didn't hold back, and he used all the strength in his body.
The sword pierced through the Sixth Princess's body, and also through his body.
Everyone in the field was shocked!
At this moment, the Sixth Princess punched Ye Xuan's chest.
Pfft!
Ye Xuan spat out a mouthful of blood, and his entire body was blasted flying.
At the side, Wuxin blinked, and then said, "This brother is a ruthless person … Should I resist a little as well?"
...
In the distance, the Sixth Princess suddenly roared furiously, "Damned ant, I'm going to skin you and extract your soul. I'm going to make you suffer for eternity …"
At this moment, the entire Underworld could hear the Sixth Princess' roar.
On the ground, Ye Xuan took a deep breath and smiled bitterly. He still wasn't able to kill that woman. That woman's physique wasn't simple, but she didn't feel good either, because he noticed that something was quickly flowing out of her body …
In a certain hall, Ksitigarbha put his palms together and sighed softly.
He didn't choose to attack.
He had anticipated this outcome when Ye Xuan saved the Equinox Flower. Therefore, he chose to call it quits with Ye Xuan. They did not owe each other anything.
On the other side, Ah Yin shook his head in silence.
He didn't choose to attack either.
Attacking meant being stained with karma, and also offending the Daoting Sixth Princess.
Offending the Daoting Sixth Princess for a mere Ye Xuan?
It wasn't worth it!
....
In the Fifth Dimension, somewhere in the starry sky.
Mu Niannian sat in the middle of the starry sky, thinking about something.
At this time, Ye Zhiming appeared beside Mu Niannian, and said anxiously, "He's in the Underworld!"
Mu Niannian looked at Ye Zhiming, but didn't say anything.
Seeing Mu Niannian's indifference, Ye Zhiming said angrily, "He's in the Underworld, in danger!"
Mu Niannian shook his head and smiled, "I've taught him so much, but he's still as childish as a child.
Greed … overestimating himself … I told him that even I don't want to provoke the Underworld, but he still went for that Dao Scripture!
I told him to act according to his capabilities, but what did he do?
He ignored my words and went to the Underworld for that Dao Scripture. This isn't just stupid, it's also ignorant and childish.
Even if I save him today, he'll still be this stupid and childish in the future.
Fine, I'll just treat it as I, Mu Niannian, misjudged him … "
After saying that, she stood up and left, her eyes filled with undisguised disappointment.
...









Chapter 1323
"He's not after the Dao Scripture!"
Ye Zhiming's voice sounded from behind Mu Niannian.
Mu Niannian stopped and turned to look at Ye Zhiming. Ye Zhiming opened her palm, revealing a green bottle.
Mu Niannian frowned. "Yellow Springs Holy Water?"
Ye Zhiming looked at Mu Niannian. "He's not going to the nether for the Dao Scripture, but for the Yellow Springs Holy Water."
Mu Niannian looked at Ye Zhiming. "What do you mean?"
Ye Zhiming walked to Mu Niannian. "He's doing it for you!"
Mu Niannian frowned. "For me?"
Ye Zhiming looked at Mu Niannian. "He knows that you're injured. He thinks that there must be something wrong with your soul, so he asked me to bring him to the nether.
Do you know how much he sacrificed to get the Yellow Springs Holy Water? "
Mu Niannian was silent.
Ye Zhiming hurriedly explained. Gradually, Mu Niannian's right hand clenched tightly, and her cold expression gradually softened.
Especially when she heard that Ye Xuan had entered the Yellow Springs River in order to get the Yellow Springs Holy Water, she clenched her right hand.
How much pain would his body and soul suffer if he couldn't use his strength to resist the corrosive power of the Yellow Springs Holy Water?
Ye Zhiming suddenly said, "He's an idiot!
The biggest idiot in the world! "
Mu Niannian replied softly, "He is!"
Ye Zhiming glanced at Mu Niannian. Just as he was about to speak, Mu Niannian opened her palm and a sword appeared in it. In the next instant, she slashed out with her sword.
As the sword slashed out, space split apart, and a pitch-black spatial crack appeared in front of the two girls. When Ye Zhiming saw the spatial crack, his expression changed drastically. "This … this is the path to the Underworld!"
Slashing open the path to the nether!
How terrifying was that?
Ye Zhiming looked at Mu Niannian as though she was looking at a monster. Her hands were trembling!
Just how strong was Mu Niannian?
The Yang World and the Yang World were guarded by the Dao World. Under normal circumstances, if one wanted to go to the Yang World, he had to go to the intersection of the Yang World and the Yang World and enter the Yang World from there.
However, there was another way, and that was to cut open the path to the netherworld. How difficult would that be?
Not only did he have to split open the Yang Realm's Universe Barrier, he also had to split open the Yang Realm's Universe Barrier. Most importantly, he had to be able to break the power of the Dao Realm.
In the instant that Mu Niannian cleaved open the Path to the Underworld, Mu Sheng suddenly looked up into the sky from a faraway wasteland. Her eyes were filled with disbelief. "Who is it!"
...
The Underworld.
Ye Xuan lay on the ground. At this moment, he had no strength at all!
In the distance, the Sixth Princess was staring at Ye Xuan with hatred.
She did not expect that she would be injured by a mortal!
Or rather, she was almost killed by a mortal!
This was undoubtedly an extraordinary humiliation to her!
The Sixth Princess stared at Ye Xuan. "I will let your soul suffer all the torture in the world of the Underworld!"
"Damn it!"
At this moment, Ye Xuan suddenly sat up on the ground and looked at Wuxin. "Brother, help me up. I can still fight!"
Everyone was speechless.
Wuxin hesitated for a moment and then said, "Brother, you really have guts!"
As he said that, he helped Ye Xuan up.
Ye Xuan took a deep breath. At the moment, he could not even stand steadily!
Wuxin helped Ye Xuan. He hesitated for a moment and then said, "Brother, do you really want to fight?"
Ye Xuan nodded and grinned. "How can I, a Swordsman, sit and wait for death?
Even if I die, I will fight to the death! "
Wuxin looked at Ye Xuan and gave him a thumbs up. "You really have guts!
I won't wait to die either!
Even if I die, I will drag someone down with me! "
Ye Xuan laughed and then said, "Brother, step aside. I'm going to use my ultimate move!"
Wuxin nodded quickly. "Okay, brother, be careful. I will cheer you on from the side. If you die, I will immediately come to accompany you. I won't be able to live today anyway!
As for the debt of you tricking me, I will settle it with you in my next life! "
As he said that, he retreated to the side.
Ye Xuan looked at the Sixth Princess in the distance and smiled sinisterly. "Didn't you want to torture me?
I am here now. Come over! "
The Sixth Princess smiled coldly. "I like people with tough bones like you. This kind of torture is more interesting!"
As she said that, she opened her palm. In an instant, a bolt of lightning condensed. The next moment, this bolt of lightning swept towards Ye Xuan with a destructive force.
Everywhere the lightning passed, the space exploded inch by inch. It was incomparably terrifying.
In the field, everyone was looking at Ye Xuan.
How would Ye Xuan resist this force now?
Ye Xuan suddenly roared with laughter, and it was an extremely mad laughter. "You can't survive if you don't go mad!
Bring it on! "
Amidst Ye Xuan's loud laughter, his head of white hair gradually turned blood-red. When that bolt of lightning arrived in front of him, his eyes had already turned into a sea of blood.
The energy of his bloodline!
At this moment, an extremely terrifying killing intent and vicious energy suffused the surroundings.
Ye Xuan stabbed with his sword. The sword was a Sword Spirit, and it was a gorgeous red!
As soon as he stabbed with his sword, the bolt of lightning was instantly blasted apart!
After all, he was at the Dao Validation Realm right now. Coupled with the energy of his bloodline, how terrifying was this attack?
Everyone present was stunned when they saw Ye Xuan shatter that bolt of lightning with a single strike of his sword.
This fellow actually still has combat strength?
Wuxin was quite shocked as well. "This brother is really ferocious …."
The Sixth Princess stared fixedly at Ye Xuan from afar. "An ant like you actually has such a bloodline!?
However, it's a waste to use it on you. I'll drain all your blood later. I presume it should be very nourishing! "
As soon as she finished speaking, she suddenly vanished on the spot.
Hiss!
The space in front of Ye Xuan was suddenly torn apart by a bolt of lightning. In the next moment, countless bolts of lightning suddenly appeared around Ye Xuan, and they were like a net that enveloped down towards Ye Xuan!
Ye Xuan took a step forward and slashed down with his sword!
A sea of blood surged into the sky as he slashed with his sword.
Bang!
In an instant, the entire Nether Dimension trembled. Countless bolts of lightning and blood red sword energy exploded madly in the surroundings, and strands of formidable force surged towards the surroundings like waves!
At this moment, the entire Nether Dimension shook!
Countless evil spirits looked towards the hill with astonishment in their eyes!
A woman suddenly appeared on the other side of the hill.
It was Ah Yin!
Ah Yin looked at Ye Xuan, who had activated the bloodline power in the distance, and his eyes were filled with disbelief. "What a powerful bloodline power … Who the hell is this guy?"
Nan Zang also appeared at the side. He also looked at Ye Xuan with a trace of astonishment in his eyes.
Ye Xuan's strength was not weak, but it was not enough to impress him. What shocked him was Ye Xuan's bloodline!
This bloodline power was not simple at all!
On the other side, the Great Netherworld Emperor also frowned slightly. He looked at Gehenna Monarch, who he had just rescued, and asked, "Do you recognize this bloodline?"
Gehenna Monarch shook his head. "I've never seen it before!
It's not recorded in the history books! "
The Great Netherworld Emperor said softly, "This person is not simple!"
Gehenna Monarch was expressionless. "No matter how not simple, he must die today!"
The Great Netherworld Emperor nodded.
He could have offended anyone, but he had to offend the Daoting Sixth Princess!
After all, the Sixth Princess was born with a Divine Body. Since birth, she had been doted on by countless people, and her status was extremely noble!
Although she was a little willful, she had the right to be willful!
Ye Xuan had dug his own grave by saving the Red Spider Lilies!
In the distance, Ye Xuan was still fighting with the Sixth Princess. At this moment, Ye Xuan had completely entered a state of madness. He did not want to lose his mind completely, but if he did not do so, he would not be able to fight!
He had caught this woman off guard the previous two times, but this time, no matter how stupid she was, she would not underestimate him again!
Therefore, he could only choose to enter a state of madness!
When he chose to enter a state of madness, he no longer cared about anything else!
Die in battle!
This was the last thought he had after entering a state of madness.
As the fight went on, the Sixth Princess's face became a little ugly. Although she was suppressing Ye Xuan, she could not kill him!
In fact, she was also a little shocked. Although Ye Xuan was only one level lower than her, the difference between the Dao Proving Realm and the Dao Controlling Realm was like heaven and earth!
The previous two times were because she had been careless, so she suffered a loss. But now, she wasn't careless in the slightest. However, she was unable to kill Ye Xuan!
Moreover, Ye Xuan was actually becoming more and more courageous as the battle progressed. Moreover, Ye Xuan's sword was very strange and ever-changing, and it contained some sort of Grand Dao. She did not dare underestimate this sword in the slightest because this sword could kill her!
After around 15 minutes, Ye Xuan was no longer suppressed, and the two of them were evenly matched!
The expressions of the experts from the Netherworld in the distance became solemn when they witnessed this scene!
They noticed that they'd severely underestimated this fellow from the Yang Realm!
Even Wang Chong of Hell had a solemn expression. In the beginning, he thought that he had been suppressed by Ye Xuan because of his carelessness. But now it would seem like besides his carelessness, Ye Xuan was very strong as well!
To a certain extent, Ye Xuan was on the same level as them!
Suddenly, the Sixth Princess was blasted 50km away by Ye Xuan's sword. After she stopped, she suddenly turned around to look at the Netherworld Emperor and the others. "Attack!"
Wang Chong and the others were slightly stunned when they heard the Sixth Princess. In the next moment, he and the Netherworld Emperor vanished on the spot.
Wu Xin flew into a rage when he saw this. "What the fuck! You're so fucking shameless!
I'll fight you to the death! "
As soon as he finished speaking, he charged forward. However, as soon as he attacked, several experts from the Netherworld obstructed his path ….
Wu Xin roared furiously, "Don't be so shameless!
Netherworld, don't be so shameless …. "
In the distance.
Bang!
An expanse of blood suddenly exploded. In the next moment, Ye Xuan was blasted flying.
As the Netherworld Emperor and the others attacked, Ye Xuan was immediately defeated!
Beating up the Sixth Princess was his limit!
Ye Xuan fell to the ground. His body split open, and blood splattered all over his body.
At this moment, the Sixth Princess suddenly appeared in front of Ye Xuan. She looked at Ye Xuan and sneered. "Come, let me drain your blood first!
Then, I'll place your soul in the Nine Underworlds and let it burn forever! "
As soon as she finished speaking, she placed her right hand on Ye Xuan's chest. In an instant, all the blood in Ye Xuan's body trembled and then left his body ….
Not far away, Ah Yin turned to look at Nanzang. Nanzang put his palms together and remained silent.
Ah Yin also remained silent.
If the two of them didn't attack, then Ye Xuan's life would end here!
At this moment, the space in the distance suddenly split open. In the next moment, a woman holding a longsword slowly walked out.
Mu Niannian!
When Mu Niannian saw Ye Xuan's miserable state, she was slightly stunned. In the next moment, she disappeared on the spot. In the distance, the Sixth Princess's expression changed drastically. She was just about to resist when a sword suddenly pierced her chest and pushed her back 3,000 miles.
Everyone present was horrified!
Mu Niannian walked to Ye Xuan and squatted down. She used her right hand to gently wipe away the blood that flowed from the corner of Ye Xuan's mouth. She smiled. "Don't be afraid. Sister Nian is here!"
.....









Chapter 1324
Mu Niannian placed her left hand on Ye Xuan's chest. A powerful force slowly seeped into Ye Xuan's body. Gradually, Ye Xuan's bloodline power calmed down.
After a while, Ye Xuan slowly opened his eyes. When he saw Mu Niannian, he was stunned. Then, he smiled bitterly. "Sister Nian!"
Mu Niannian smiled faintly, "Do you feel better?"
Ye Xuan shook his head. "I've caused you trouble again!"
Mu Niannian said softly. "You're very silly!"
Ye Xuan looked at Mu Niannian. Mu Niannian gently wiped the blood off Ye Xuan's face. "My injury can't be healed by the Yellow Springs Holy Water!"
Ye Xuan frowned. "Not even the Yellow Springs Holy Water?"
Mu Niannian nodded. "Of course not. Otherwise, I would have come to rob it!"
Ye Xuan quickly asked. "What about that white guy's purple aura?"
Mu Niannian shook her head. "That purple aura is useful to me. But it can't heal my injury!"
Ye Xuan still wanted to say something. Mu Niannian smiled. "My injury was caused by myself. No one can help me except myself!"
Ye Xuan was about to speak. Suddenly, a hideous voice came from afar. "Bitch! How dare you hurt me!"
Ye Xuan and Mu Niannian looked up. The Sixth Princess had returned!
However, there was still a sword stuck in the Sixth Princess's chest!
But she was still alive. It was as if some kind of power was protecting her!
Next to the Sixth Princess, the Netherworld Emperor said. "Sixth Princess, this person is not simple!"
Sixth Princess didn't care at all. She looked at Mu Niannian with hatred and said crazily: "Bitch, you …"
Right at this time, Mu Niannian suddenly disappeared.
Not far away, the Netherworld Great Emperor's expression changed drastically. "Princess, be careful!"
As he spoke, he was just about to attack when Mu Niannian had appeared in front of the Sixth Princess. The Sixth Princess's expression changed drastically, and she clenched her fists tightly. In an instant, countless bolts of lightning converged around her and formed a powerful barrier of lightning!
However, Mu Niannian ignored the lightning and grabbed the Sixth Princess by the throat.
Boom!
Those lightning bolts instantly disappeared without a trace!
Everyone in the surroundings was dumbstruck when they witnessed this scene!
The sixth princess was a Dao Defense Realm expert!
Although it was a little overpowered, it shouldn't be enough to defeat him in one move!
The Sixth Princess was also in disbelief. She never thought that she would be defeated in a single move!
At this moment, Mu Niannian laughed and said, "Your mouth stinks!"
With that, she grabbed the Sixth Princess's mouth with both hands and tore it apart!
Chi!
Under the watchful eyes of everyone, the Sixth Princess' mouth was ripped open!
"Ah!"
A heart wrenching shrill cry instantly resounded!
At this moment, the Sixth Princess's extremely beautiful face had become extremely ferocious!
After she tore apart the Sixth Princess' mouth, Mu Niannian smashed her against the ground, and then she stomped her foot on the Sixth Princess' face. Mu Niannian grinned, but it was a slightly ghastly smile, "You drained him dry?
What kind of stinking brother are you? "
The Netherworld Emperor spoke in a low voice, "Who exactly are you!?"
At this moment, the Netherworld Emperor had an extremely vigilant expression on his face because this woman was truly too terrifying!
Mu Niannian gazed at the Netherworld Emperor, "You're part of the reason why he's so heavily injured, right?"
The Netherworld Emperor's eyes narrowed slightly, and he didn't hesitate to clench his fists tightly. In an instant, countless spirits converged into his body, and then the space before him suddenly transformed into a deathly silent expanse. Moreover, the howls of countless spirits resounded throughout this deathly silent expanse.
At this moment, a ray of sword light suddenly entered the deathly stillness. In the next moment, under everyone's shocked gazes, the ray of sword light tore the deathly stillness apart. Then, the ray of sword light pierced the Netherworld Emperor's forehead.
Bang!
The Netherworld Emperor's soul was obliterated!
He was instantly killed with a single attack!
At this moment, all the experts from the Nether Dimension were astounded, and they gazed at Mu Niannian as if she was a monster!
Who exactly is she?
She's actually so terrifying!
Mu Niannian didn't attack again. She just held the Sixth Princess by her hair and walked slowly towards Ye Xuan who stood nearby.
The Sixth Princess was being dragged like a piece of trash!
When has the noble Sixth Princess ever suffered such humiliation?
The Sixth Princess roared madly.
However, Mu Niannian paid no attention to her. She dragged the Sixth Princess over to Ye Xuan and smiled, "Kill her!"
Ye Xuan picked up the Sword Spirit. Suddenly, Gehenna King spoke abruptly, "Do you know who she is?"
Mu Niannian gazed at Gehenna King and smiled, "Who is she!?"
Gehenna King spoke solemnly, "She's the Sixth Princess that the Daoist Ancestor dotes on the most!"
Daoting!
Mu Niannian blinked, "So she's Daoting!
No wonder she's so arrogant! "
As she spoke, she looked at the Sixth Princess in front of her. The Sixth Princess glared at Mu Niannian with hatred, "My father won't let you off!"
Gehenna King shook his head and couldn't help but curse in his heart. Damn, isn't this woman too stupid?
Even now, she still doesn't understand the situation?
Big Sister, the woman holding the sword in front of you is most likely a real Dao Breaker!
In front of such a strong person, shouldn't you restrain your bad temper?
Mu Niannian laughed, "This is the first time I've seen such a stupid woman like you!"
After that, she looked at Ye Xuan, "Kill her!"
Ye Xuan was about to make a move when Nanzang suddenly stepped forward and clasped his hands together, "Young Master Ye, please show mercy!"
Ye Xuan looked at Nan Zang. Nan Zang said softly, "Mister Ye, have you ever thought that although you felt great when you swung your sword down,
Although you'll feel happy with this strike, you and the lady next to you will have endless trouble. "
Ye Xuan was silent.
Mu Niannian gently stroked Ye Xuan's cheek and smiled, "Are you afraid?"
Ye Xuan shook his head, "I'm not afraid, but I don't want to cause trouble for you!"
He didn't forget that Mu Niannian was injured.
Now that the Fifth Dimension Tribulation was about to arrive, if he killed this woman, Daoting would target Mu Niannian …
In the distance, Nanzang said, "Young Master Ye, Daoting is not something the two of you can resist."
Ah Yin nodded, "If you kill her, it's the same as provoking Daoting!"
Mu Niannian suddenly smiled, "You two, when she wanted to kill my little brother, why didn't you come out?"
Ah Yin looked at Mu Niannian, "Your Excellency, we advised you not to kill her, it was for your own good!"
Mu Niannian suddenly disappeared. In the next instant, a sword was pressed against Ah Yin's forehead. Ah Yin looked at Mu Niannian and didn't resist, her expression calm.
Mu Niannian smiled, "You came out to speak, not for our own good, but to save this Daoting Sixth Princess, so that Daoting will owe you a favor, right?"
Ah Yin was silent.
Mu Niannian suddenly slashed down.
Chi!
One of Ah Yin's arms flew off!
Ah Yin frowned, her left hand slowly clenched. Mu Niannian smiled, she lightly patted Ah Yin's cheek with her sword, "Spirit of the Underworld, I don't blame you for not saving this little guy before. After all, you don't owe this little guy anything, there's no need to offend such a big power like Daoting for a little guy.
But now, you want to use him to make Daoting owe you a favor, and you even say it's for our own good … Playing such petty tricks with me? "
As she said that, she waved her left hand, and a sword suddenly landed in her hand!
Soul Suppressing Sword!
Seeing this, Ah Yin's expression changed!
Mu Niannian smiled, "If your sword absorbs this Spirit of the Underworld, it can go up another level!"
At this moment, Ah Yin suddenly clenched her left hand, and in an instant, the entire Underworld trembled. In an instant, the power of countless Yin spirits gathered here!
Mu Niannian chuckled and slashed forward.
Chi!
With this slash, all the Yin spirits in the world dispersed!
In an instant, Ah Yin's soul became illusory!
Everyone's expression changed!
This slash directly injured the source of the Underworld!
Ah Yin stared at Mu Niannian, "I underestimated you!"
Mu Niannian blinked, "Do you think you can see through me now?"
With that, she stabbed Soul Suppressing Sword at Ah Yin.
At this moment, Ah Yin suddenly looked at Ye Xuan, "If it wasn't for my help, you wouldn't have reached the Yellow Spring River!"
Ye Xuan glanced at Ah Yin, then at Mu Niannian, "Sister Nian, forget it!
She helped me reach the Yellow Spring River! "
Mu Niannian thought about it, then nodded and let go of Ah Yin, "You're even!"
With that, she looked at Ah Yin, the corners of her mouth lifting slightly, "You're so stupid, using such a favor just like that!"
Ah Yin's pupils shrank, "You did it on purpose!"
Mu Niannian smiled, "Spirit of the Underworld, I won't kill you this time, but next time you dare to scheme against this little guy, I will destroy your soul!
This little guy can only be schemed against by me alone! "
With that, she turned to Nan Zang, "What are you looking at?
Why aren't you scramming? "
Nan Zang's expression changed slightly, but he didn't say anything. He put his palms together and quietly retreated.
Mu Niannian turned to Ye Xuan, placed the sword in Ye Xuan's hand, then pointed at Sixth Princess on the ground, "Stab her to death!"
Ye Xuan looked at Sixth Princess, who said fiercely, "Daoting …"
With that, Ye Xuan suddenly said, "Daoting your grandmother …"
As he spoke, he held the sword with both hands and stabbed it towards Sixth Princess' chest. Right at this moment, a mysterious force suddenly appeared before Sixth Princess' chest, and Ye Xuan's sword couldn't move an inch further!
Space suddenly split open in the sky, and then an old man in a Daoist robe walked out from within!
Daolord Qing Ming!
One of the four great experts of the Underworld!
Moreover, Daolord Qing Ming was from Daoting!
Mu Niannian looked at Daolord Qing Ming and smiled without saying a word.
Daolord Qing Ming gazed at Mu Niannian with a vigilant expression. "Daobreaker!"
Mu Niannian didn't answer Daolord Qing Ming, and she looked at Ye Xuan instead. She was about to speak when Ye Xuan suddenly said, "I understand!"
As soon as he finished speaking, he stabbed his sword into Sixth Princess' abdomen.
Hiss!
Blood sprayed!
A powerful strand of Sword Intent raged madly within Sixth Princess' body!
Sixth Princess was stunned by this scene, and then her voice trembled, "You … you actually dared to kill me!
You … "
Ye Xuan thought for a moment, and then he said, "Does it hurt?"
Everyone was speechless.
Daolord Qing Ming stared fixedly at Ye Xuan and Mu Niannian, "Both of you are finished!"

Chapter 1325
Kill!
At first, Ye Xuan did not want to kill because he was afraid of causing trouble for Mu Niannian!
But then he changed his mind!
Because he realized that even if he did not kill her, would this woman let it go?
This woman would never let this matter rest!
Since that was the case, why not kill her?
Killing one is one!
After Ye Xuan stabbed the Sixth Princess to death, he took out the Soul Suppressing Sword and stabbed it into the Sixth Princess' body. In an instant, the Sixth Princess' soul was absorbed completely.
Seeing the Sixth Princess' soul being absorbed, the expressions of all the Underworld powerhouses changed!
Ye Xuan really killed the Daoting Sixth Princess!
Not only did he kill her, but he also absorbed her soul!
This was not an ordinary kind of ruthless move!
Not far away, Gehenna King glanced at Mu Niannian and did not say anything.
At this time, he did not dare to say anything.
Was this woman in front of him confident?
Or did she not understand Daoting at all?
It should be said that it was both!
If this woman understood Daoting, perhaps she would not have done things so ruthlessly!
No matter what, Daoting would definitely not let this matter go.
However, this was not the end.
Mu Niannian looked at Dao Lord Qing Ming, who said softly, "You are very brave!
I hope you do not regret it! "
After saying that, he gradually became illusory.
He did not choose to make a move because he was not confident that he could win. Moreover, there was no need to make a move. Daoting would naturally have someone to deal with this woman!
What he needed to do now was to inform Daoting!
Beside Mu Niannian, Ye Xuan said in a low voice, "He should have gone to call for help!"
Mu Niannian nodded and smiled. "I deliberately let him go!"
Ye Xuan glanced at Mu Niannian. "Sister Nian, is Daoting very powerful?"
Mu Niannian laughed. "It's just so-so!"
Ye Xuan was speechless.
At this time, Mu Niannian glanced at Ye Xuan. Right now, Ye Xuan had a head full of white hair, his face was old, and his body was broken into pieces. He was as miserable as one could imagine.
Mu Niannian gently stroked Ye Xuan's snow-white hair and softly said, "You are so silly."
As she spoke, she gazed at the experts from the Nether Dimension, and then she opened her palm and a sword appeared there.
The expressions of all the experts from the Yin Dimension changed drastically when they witnessed this scene!
At this moment, Mu Niannian suddenly looked up and saw a middle-aged man suddenly appear in the sky above Necropolis. In the next moment, the middle-aged man appeared in front of Mu Niannian.
When they saw this person, all the experts of the Yin Dimension hurriedly bowed respectfully. "Master of Yin!"
The middle-aged man in front of him was the Lord of the Underworld!
Yin Master glanced at Ye Xuan, and then he gazed at Mu Niannian, "All of you can leave!"
The experts of the Yin Dimension exchanged glances when they heard this.
We're letting Ye Xuan go just like that?
Mu Niannian smiled, "I don't want to leave right now!"
Yin Master gazed at Mu Niannian, "The Daoting's forces will arrive in an hour at most!"
Mu Niannian nodded, "I'll wait for them here!"
Yin Master fell silent.
Right at this moment, the sword in Mu Niannian's hand suddenly flew out, and then numerous heads flew up into the air.
Yin Master frowned slightly, and then he opened his palm. In an instant, a black iron chain locked down that ray of light.
Yin Master gazed at Mu Niannian, "If both of you leave now, then my Nether Dimension won't interfere in the matter between both of you and the Daoting!"
Mu Niannian suddenly pressed his fingers together and pointed forward.
Bang!
The imprisoned ray of light suddenly trembled violently, and then the black iron chain was slashed apart. The ray of light shot straight towards the Lord of the Underworld.
The Lord of the Underworld frowned slightly, and then he pressed his palm forward lightly. As soon as he did so, countless strands of Yin Energy and Death Energy instantly converged within his palm.
The sword arrived.
Bang!
Under the astounded gazes of everyone, the Lord of the Underworld instantly retreated explosively by 3km!
He'd repulsed the Lord of the Underworld with a single strike of his sword!
Mu Niannian gazed at Ye Xuan and grinned, "Anyone who injures you here must die!"
As soon as she finished speaking, her expression suddenly became slightly savage. In the next moment, she suddenly vanished on the spot with her sword in hand, and then her sword instantly pierced through a Dao Proving Realm expert of the Underworld!
This expert hadn't even been able to react to what had happened!
After this expert of the Underworld was killed, Mu Niannian appeared in front of another expert of the Underworld, and then a ray of light flashed as the head of a spirit flew into the air!
In the distance, the Lord of the Underworld's eyes narrowed slightly, and then he suddenly spread open his right hand. In the next moment, he suddenly clenched it tightly and smashed his fist forward. A formidable black colored fist swept through the surroundings!
Countless vengeful spirits and evil spirits roared within this black fist.
In the distance, Mu Niannian suddenly stopped, and she didn't even turn around before she stabbed backwards with her sword!
Bang!
The black fist was directly forced to stop, and then it shattered into pieces in the next moment!
Mu Niannian slashed with her sword while carrying the Lord of the Underworld on her back.
Hiss!
A strand of sword energy tore through the sky.
The Lord of the Underworld's pupils constricted, and he raised his arm horizontally to block it.
Bang!
The Lord of the Underworld instantly retreated explosively by another 3km!
When he stopped, over 30 Dao Proving Realm experts in the distant horizon had been annihilated!
Even Ghost Emperor 10 Directions had been annihilated!
All of them had been killed by a single sword strike!
Just a single sword strike!
Something worthy of mentioning was that she used the Soul Suppression Sword, so the soul of every single expert of the Underworld she killed would be absorbed by the Soul Suppression Sword ….
On the other side, Wuxin gazed at Mu Niannian while he gulped, and then he walked over to Ye Xuan's side and said, "My god! Brother, this big sister of yours is too ferocious!
Does she lack a little brother?
Why don't I call her big sister as well …? "
Ye Xuan blinked, and then he patted Wuxin lightly on the shoulder. "If you recognize me as your big brother, then you'll be my little brother. Do you understand what I mean?"
Wuxin shook his head. "I'm older than you!
Just recognize me as your big brother! "
Ye Xuan gazed at Wuxin. "Are you sure?"
Wuxin's eyelids twitched. "I'm not sure!
Let me think about it! "
He was slightly afraid when he saw the expression on Ye Xuan's face. Dammit! This fellow is someone who doesn't pay with his life!
Become his big brother?
I'm afraid I'll be tricked to death!
Ye Xuan was about to speak when Mu Niannian suddenly appeared in front of him. She handed the Soul Suppression Sword to Ye Xuan. "This sword will become stronger!"
Ye Xuan was silent.
In fact, his heart was also unusually calm at this moment.
In a short period of time, Mu Niannian had killed over 30 Dao Validation experts!
How terrifying was that?
Moreover, it was under the circumstances that the Lord of the Underworld had made a move!
Ye Xuan took the Soul Suppression Sword and then said, "Big Sister Nian, how strong are you?"
Mu Niannian smiled slightly. "Not very strong. At least, I can't beat that Qing 'er of yours!"
Ye Xuan almost fainted.
Qing 'er!
Big Sister Nian was going against Qing 'er!
However, Ye Xuan suddenly realized something. Big Sister Nian was so terrifying, but she still couldn't beat Qing 'er. How strong was Qing' er?
Ye Xuan couldn't imagine it!
At this moment, Mu Niannian suddenly said, "Open your mouth!"
Ye Xuan instinctively opened his mouth. Mu Niannian took out a green bottle and opened it. Then she poured all the Yellow Springs Holy Water into Ye Xuan's mouth.
Ye Xuan's expression changed drastically. He was about to spit it out when Mu Niannian glared at him. "Swallow it!"
Ye Xuan smiled bitterly and didn't swallow it.
Mu Niannian shook her head. "This Yellow Springs Holy Water is useless to me."
Ye Xuan frowned slightly. At this moment, Mu Niannian pointed a finger at his chest, and the Netherworld Holy Water in Ye Xuan's mouth was instantly swallowed.
Ye Xuan asked in a low voice, "Big Sister Nian, what injury are you suffering from?"
Mu Niannian smiled. "I'm not suffering from injury, but a responsibility. And this responsibility has trapped me!"
Ye Xuan wanted to ask more, but Mu Niannian suddenly smiled. "Don't ask!
You'll know soon enough! "
Ye Xuan was silent.
Mu Niannian looked around and said softly, "Do you remember what I told you?
Even I don't want to provoke the underworld! "
Ye Xuan nodded. "I'm sorry."
Mu Niannian smiled. "When I first heard that you came to the underworld, I was very, very disappointed.
I thought you had nothing to fear, that's why you dared to come to the underworld.
But I didn't expect you to come for me. "
At this point, she looked at Ye Xuan and smiled. "Although you came for me, I still have to say that you're really stupid."
Ye Xuan nodded. "I just wanted to do something for you!"
Mu Niannian chuckled. "Fool, do you know that if I was a step late, you would have lost your life!"
Ye Xuan smiled bitterly. "I could have left, really. But I didn't expect that woman to suddenly come!"
If it wasn't for Daoting that woman, he really would have left!
Mu Niannian looked at Ye Xuan. "I chose you and helped you because I wanted to make use of you. Do you understand?"
Ye Xuan was silent.
Mu Niannian asked again, "Is it worth risking your life for someone who wants to use you?"
Ye Xuan looked at Mu Niannian and smiled. "Big Sister Nian!"
Big Sister Nian!
This' Big Sister Nian 'was better than a thousand words.
Mu Niannian suddenly shook her head and smiled. "You …"
As she said, she gently rubbed Ye Xuan's head. "You look really ugly now. Quickly heal your injuries and restore your original appearance."
Ye Xuan sat cross-legged on the ground and began to heal his injuries.
At this time, Wu Xin hurriedly said, "Big Sister, do you still need a younger brother?"
Mu Niannian glanced at Wu Xin. In the next moment, she waved her right hand.
Bang!
Wu Xin was directly thrown hundreds of feet away and finally fell heavily to the ground.
Ye Xuan: "…"
On the ground, Wu Xin wailed. "Why is this!"
In the distance, the Lord of Underworld suddenly said, "Fifth Dimension Tendo, is it worth it to do this for a human?"
Obviously, he already knew Mu Niannian's identity.
Mu Niannian looked at the Lord of Underworld. The Lord of Underworld said, "You should know how powerful Daoting is!"
Mu Niannian smiled and said, "I don't care!
There are actually very few things that I care about. There used to be only one, but now, there is one more.
One is the universe that I protect, and the other is this little guy! "
The Lord of Underworld said softly, "I wish you good luck!"
After saying that, he slowly retreated.
At this time, the sky suddenly cracked open. The next moment, an extremely powerful aura suddenly swept out from the cracked space.
Seeing this scene, Ye Xuan's expression changed. He was about to get up when Mu Niannian suddenly said, "Heal your injuries."
Ye Xuan looked at Mu Niannian. Mu Niannian picked up Ye Xuan's Soul Suppressing Sword. She looked at Ye Xuan and the corners of her mouth slightly raised. "There are only three people who can kill Sister Nian. Unfortunately, all three of them are with you. Sister Nian is very cunning, right?
Hehe … "
Ye Xuan did not laugh because he found that there was clearly something wrong with Mu Niannian's body …
Her body was illusory!
Ye Xuan forcibly stood up and walked to Mu Niannian's side. Then, she grabbed Mu Niannian's hand and grinned. "Advance and retreat together, live and die together …"
.....









Chapter 1326
Daoting!
Ye Xuan didn't know how strong Daoting was, but he knew that it was definitely very strong, at least above the Underworld.
Sister Nian might be able to suppress the Underworld, but she might not be able to suppress Daoting!
Especially when Sister Nian was still injured!
But no matter what, this time, the siblings would advance and retreat together, and they would live and die together!
Hearing Ye Xuan's words, Mu Niannian glanced at him but didn't say anything.
At this moment, a middle-aged man suddenly appeared in the sky. He wore a dark white robe, and there was a domineering aura between his brows. In his hand, he held a meter-long golden whip. The golden whip flickered with golden light, and one could tell that it wasn't an ordinary item at first glance.
When this middle-aged man appeared, the gloomy aura of death around him actually retreated slowly, not daring to approach him.
At this moment, Wu Xin walked to Ye Xuan's side and said in a deep voice, "This is one of the Four Great Divine Generals of Daoting, Heng Tianwu."
Ye Xuan glanced at Wu Xin, "There are three more?"
Wu Xin nodded.
Ye Xuan fell silent.
Wu Xin said in a deep voice, "This person isn't simple. It should be said that every Divine General isn't simple, because they walked out of the Purgatory of Death step by step.
Do you know about the Purgatory of Death?
It's an extremely terrifying battlefield. Every once in a while, the Daoting and the Dao Tomb will fight there, and it's extremely tragic.
It can be said that these Divine Generals have been fighting their entire lives!
In their world, it's all about fighting. "
Ye Xuan raised his head to look at Heng Tianwu, and he suddenly realized why the gloomy aura of death didn't dare to approach him!
Because Heng Tianwu had an extremely terrifying murderous aura. How many people would he have to kill to form such a murderous aura?
In terms of temperament, this Divine General was many times stronger than the Sixth Princess!
Could Nian Nian defeat him?
Ye Xuan looked at Mu Niannian with a trace of worry in his eyes.
In the sky, Heng Tianwu looked down at Mu Niannian and said, "I never thought that a little Tendo could cultivate to this level!"
Mu Niannian laughed. "You came alone?"
Heng Tianwu proudly smiled, "Is it not enough?"
As soon as he finished speaking, the golden whip in his hand suddenly trembled violently. In an instant, a boundless golden light suddenly covered the entire sky. Under the golden light, the Yin Qi and Death Qi in the surroundings instantly disappeared without a trace.
In the center of the golden light, Heng Tianwu held the golden whip with one hand and looked like a god of war.
Below, Mu Niannian had his left hand behind his back and his right hand holding a sword. His expression was calm. Compared to Heng Tian Wu, Mu Niannian was like a small boat in the raging waves. He seemed so frail.
In the sky, Heng Tianwu suddenly stomped his right foot on the ground. In an instant, that expanse of golden light had shrunk back into his body. In the next moment, he held the golden whip in his hand as he dived down with a savage expression. "Die!"
When they saw Heng Tianwu diving down, the expressions of the experts from the Underworld in the surroundings instantly changed!
As Heng Tianwu dived down, the entire world was obliterated inch by inch, and if he was allowed to descend to the ground, then everything in an area of a few hundreds of thousands of kilometers would probably transform into nothingness!
This attack was Heng Tianwu's strongest attack!
He who'd come out from the Purgatory of Death wouldn't underestimate his enemy. Because not to mention underestimating his enemy, even a single mistake in that place would cause him to be consigned to eternal damnation!
Moreover, he wouldn't underestimate this Fifth Dimensional Tendo that stood before him. Because he was unable to discern Mu Niannian's actual strength!
But no matter how strong Mu Niannian was, he had to attack with his full strength and not hold back in the slightest!
Not far away, Ye Xuan slowly clenched his fists tightly. This Heng Tianwu is countless times stronger than the Sixth Princess!
Think!
Ye Xuan looked at Mu Niannian. Mu Niannian's expression was calm in the distance, and the formidable pressure didn't affect her at all.
When Heng Tianwu arrived 300m above Mu Niannian, the ground in the surroundings collapsed and sunk down.
Meanwhile, Mu Niannian attacked.
Under the gazes of everyone, Mu Niannian transformed into a ray of light that shot into the sky. This ray of light was fine like a strand of hair, and it was practically impossible to notice with the naked eye!
A breath of time later.
Hiss!
A light sound of something tearing resounded abruptly.
At this moment, everyone was stunned.
Mu Niannian stood in the sky with her sword in hand, and Heng Tianwu descended slowly behind her. There was a strand of light between his brows.
He'd been instantly annihilated!
At this moment, all the experts of the Nether Dimension were dumbstruck!
Ye Xuan and Wu Xin were petrified on the spot.
It ended just like that?
It felt like the foreplay lasted for an hour, and the main event lasted for three breaths of time.
On the other side of the sky, the Lord of the Nether Dimension stared fixedly at Mu Niannian who held a sword in his hand, and it was unknown what he was thinking.
Nanzang pressed his palms together and silently chanted Buddha's name.
At this moment, A 'Yin was looking at Mu Niannian as well. She just stared at Mu Niannian while the shock in her heart couldn't be any greater.
She'd killed a Divine General in an instant!
Even if she was a Dao Breaker, it was impossible for her to kill a Divine General in an instant with such ease!
But Mu Niannian still hadn't broken through into the Dao!
Exactly how strong is she?
At this moment, that was the question in the hearts of everyone here, and it was the same question in Heng Tianwu's heart as well.
That attack from before had instantly dispersed all his strength, and he didn't even have the chance to defend himself!
An instant kill with a single attack!
Even he hadn't imagined that he would be killed in an instant!
After all, he'd used all his strength!
Suddenly, a sword stabbed into the top of his head.
The Soul Suppression Sword!
In the blink of an eye, the Soul Suppressing Sword had completely absorbed the remnant soul.
In the sky, Mu Niannian opened her palm, and Heng Tianwu's golden whip fell into her grasp. She sized it up before she tapped it with her finger, and then the golden whip descended in front of Ye Xuan.
Ye Xuan didn't take the golden whip, and he gazed at Mu Niannian instead. At this moment, Mu Niannian's countenance was slightly pale, and she was coughing.
Mu Niannian grinned when she noticed Ye Xuan's gaze, "I'm fine!"
As she spoke, she turned around to glance at the Lord of the Nether Dimension, and then she smiled, "I'm injured now!
Moreover, it's quite severe. Do you intend to lend a hand?
That's a good opportunity! "
The Lord of the Nether Dimension gazed at Mu Niannian in silence.
Mu Niannian roared with laughter, "Since you're not going to lend a hand, then we'll be leaving!"
As soon as she finished speaking, she gazed at Ye Xuan, "Let's go!"
Ye Xuan nodded, and then he picked up the golden whip and hurriedly followed by Mu Niannian's side. As if he'd thought of something, he suddenly gazed at Wu Xin, "Why aren't you leaving?
Do you want to stay and eat? "
Wu Xin shuddered when he heard this, and he hurriedly followed them.
At this moment, no one in the Nether Dimension dared to stop them!
Right at this moment, Mu Niannian suddenly stopped, and then she turned around to look at the Lord of the Nether Dimension and smiled, "Help me send a message to the Daoting. Tell him to either send more or stronger forces next time!"
As soon as she finished speaking, she led Ye Xuan and Wu Xin along as she vanished on the spot.
The Lord of the Nether Dimension remained silent.
Meanwhile, a voice suddenly resounded from his side, "I never expected that such an expert actually existed in the Yang Dimension!"
The person who spoke was Daolord Qing Ming!
At this moment, he felt very fortunate that he hadn't attacked just now, otherwise, he would be the one dead!
Actually, he was very shocked because a Divine General had been instantly killed just like that!
It was an instant kill!
He could accept it if he'd won, but it was an instant kill, and it was completely different. Moreover, this Divine General had experienced numerous battles, and both his combat awareness and strength were top-notch.
However, he'd still been instantly killed!
A single strike!
After a long moment of silence, Qing Ming suddenly said, "I'm going to the Daoting!"
The Lord of the Nether Dimension suddenly said, "Will the Daoting continue sending forces?"
Qing Ming spoke softly, "They definitely will!
Because the identity of the Sixth Princess isn't simple at all!
She isn't just the Sixth Princess of the Daoting …. "
As soon as he finished speaking, he turned around and left.
The Lord of the Nether Dimension remained silent for a long time.
...
Mu Niannian didn't bring Ye Xuan directly back to the Fifth Dimension, and they arrived at the intersection of the Yang Dimension and the Yang Dimension instead.
Mu Niannian glanced at the surroundings and said softly, "Come out!"
As soon as she finished speaking, a woman suddenly appeared in front of Mu Niannian.
It was Mu Sheng from the Dao World!
Mu Sheng gazed at Mu Niannian, "It was you who forcefully opened the path between the Yang Dimension and the Nether Dimension!"
Mu Niannian suddenly said, "Ask the Red Spider Lilies to come out!"
Ye Xuan gazed at Mu Niannian, "Big Sister Nian …."
Mu Niannian smiled, "Don't worry, I just want to see them!"
Mu Sheng didn't speak.
The corners of Mu Niannian's mouth curled up slightly, "Do you want me to repeat myself?"
Mu Sheng gazed at Mu Niannian. Meanwhile, a ray of red light suddenly appeared, and then Man Zhu and Sha Hua appeared in front of Ye Xuan.
Both of them glanced at Mu Niannian with fear in their eyes.
Mu Niannian walked over to them, and she stared at them for a long time before she spoke softly, "Let's go!"
She turned around and left once she finished speaking.
Ye Xuan nodded lightly, and then he left with Wu Xin.
Meanwhile, Man Zhu spoke abruptly, "Young Master Ye!"
Ye Xuan turned around and gazed at Man Zhu. Man Zhu hesitated for a moment before she said, "I'm sorry!"
Ye Xuan smiled, "It's my own choice!
Also, both of you should live well!
Don't let this lifetime down! "
He turned around and left once he finished speaking.
In next to no time, Ye Xuan's group of three vanished into the distance.
Sha Hua suddenly said, "She tried to kill us just now!"
Man Zhu nodded, "Because of us, Young Master Ye offended the entire Daoting. This evil karma …."
Sha Hua frowned slightly, "But why did she give up?"
Man Zhu shook her head, "I don't know!"
...
At the end of the horizon, Ye Xuan walked over to Mu Niannian's side, "Big Sister Nian …."
Mu Niannian said softly, "I just wanted to see if you were tainted by the Daoting's karma because of yourself, or if it was done by someone else out of malice.
Those two little girls were indeed treated unfairly. You saved them, half of it was because of me, and the other half was because of your kindness …. "
Speaking of this, she looked at Ye Xuan and smiled, "You can't blame others for this.
Speaking of which, you offended the entire Daoting because of these two sisters. Moreover, these two sisters won't bring you any benefits. Do you really think it's worth it? "
Ye Xuan thought for a moment, then said, "If people do things based on whether it's worth it or not, wouldn't it be too boring?"
Mu Niannian was stunned, then gently rubbed Ye Xuan's head with her right hand, "Great kindness!"
At this time, her body suddenly became illusory.
Ye Xuan's face changed greatly, "Big Sister Nian!"
Mu Niannian smiled lightly, "I won't die!"
Ye Xuan grabbed Mu Niannian's hand tightly, he said in a trembling voice, "I want to find Qing 'er, can you help me find Qing' er?"

Chapter 1327
Look for Qing 'er!
At this moment, Ye Xuan was afraid!
He was afraid that Mu Niannian would die!
He had such a strong feeling.
Mu Niannian was injured to begin with. Her attack this time would definitely affect her quite a bit. Most importantly, Dao Ting would definitely not let this matter rest!
The next time they come, the Daoting might not be a Divine General!
What would happen to Mu Niannian then?
Only when Qing 'er arrived would they be able to deal with the Daoting!
Mu Niannian looked at the flustered Ye Xuan and smiled. She said softly, "It's really fine. You have to believe me. As long as I don't want to die, it's really hard for me to die."
Ye Xuan shook her head. She held onto Mu Niannian's hand tightly. "You're fooling me again!
Sister Nian, you're so powerful. Can you help me find Qing 'er?
To be honest, I don't want to fight anymore!
I want Qing 'er to kill the Daoting! "
Hearing this, Mu Niannian shook her head and smiled. "You bastard!"
As she said this, she looked into the depths of space and said softly, "Not long ago, I could still sense her … but now, I can't sense her at all!"
Ye Xuan was confused. "Where did she go?"
Mu Niannian looked at Ye Xuan. "She cares about you so much. I believe that she would not leave you unless she had no other choice!
She chose to leave because she wanted you to grow up on your own. Secondly, she had no choice but to leave.
The Cause of Adversity on you is very complicated. It's so complicated that even someone as powerful as me can't do anything about it. Not only that, but it also backfired on me. "
Ye Xuan said in a low voice, "I've dragged you into this!"
Mu Niannian shook her head. "I chose you!
Just like how you saved those sisters!
You saved them. Although you offended the Daoting, it was your choice.
And I chose you. Do you understand? "
Ye Xuan looked at Mu Niannian and said, "Sister Nian, you're not afraid of Daoting, right?"
Mu Niannian smirked. "I'm not afraid of anyone except your Qing 'er!"
Ye Xuan shook his head and laughed. "Sister Nian, you're being mischievous again!"
Mu Niannian laughed heartily!
At this time, Wu Xin suddenly asked, "Is that Qing'Er very powerful?"
Ye Xuan shrugged. "I'm not that good. I'm on par with Qing 'er!"
A fifty-fifty chance!
Mu Niannian laughed. "Yes, it's 50-50!"
With that, the two siblings disappeared into the horizon.
In the same place, Heartless frowned slightly. "Fifty-fifty … Why does it sound a little unreliable to me!
Are you trying to fool me? "
....
After returning to the Fifth Dimension, Mu Niannian disappeared once again.
Ye Xuan knew that she must have gone to roast fish again.
As for why Mu Niannian liked to eat fish, Ye Xuan was also puzzled. Could it be that Sister Nian was a cat?
Ye Xuan returned to the Fifth Dimension Hall. There was only Guan Yin in the hall.
It was worth mentioning that Guan Yin had already reached Solitary Release!
Ye Xuan said in a deep voice, "The Fifth Dimension Calamity is coming!
Are there any signs in the Fifth Dimension? "
Guan Yin shook her head. "No!
It's very calm! "
Ye Xuan frowned slightly. "That shouldn't be the case!
Under normal circumstances, there would definitely be signs! "
Guan Yin said in a deep voice, "Yes, this is also what I'm puzzled about. However, the Fifth Dimension is normal!
It's just that the spiritual energy is not comparable to other places! "
Ye Xuan was silent.
Guan Yin suddenly said, "I heard that you went to the underworld?"
Ye Xuan nodded his head.
Guan Yin said in a deep voice, "You have the Dao Scripture and three lives. The underworld will not let us go, right?"
Ye Xuan smiled bitterly. "Right now, it's not the underworld's problem, but the Daoting!
I killed the sixth princess of the Daoting, so our enemy is not only the underworld, but also the Daoting! "
Guan Yin: "…"
Ye Xuan said in a soft voice, "How many Solitary Release Realm experts are there now?"
Guan Yin said in a deep voice, "In the entire Fifth Dimension, there are a total of twelve true Solitary Release Realm experts!"
Twelve!
Ye Xuan shook his head. "It's still too little!"
Guan Yin nodded. "I know, but there's no other way. To reach the true Solitary Release Realm, just relying on the Dao Scripture is not enough, you also need to have enough talent and strength!"
Ye Xuan thought about it, then said, "The overall strength of the Fifth Dimension should only be second to the underworld and the Daoting, as well as the mysterious Whirling World and the mysterious Dao Tomb!
I have several Dao Scriptures, so I'm afraid I can't get along well with these forces. "
Guan Yin said, "What are your plans?"
Ye Xuan said in a soft voice, "Not only do we have to face external threats, we also have to deal with the Fifth Dimension Tribulation … Our situation is not good, you have to be mentally prepared!"
Guan Yin looked at Ye Xuan and was silent, his expression solemn.
Ye Xuan suddenly said, "I'm going to talk to Zhiming!"
With that, he stood up and left.
Soon, Ye Xuan arrived at a small courtyard. This was Ye Zhiming's courtyard.
Ye Zhiming sat on a stone bench, her hands resting on her cheeks, thinking about something.
When she saw Ye Xuan, she immediately sat up straight and returned to normal.
Ye Xuan said with a smile, "Zhiming!"
Ye Zhiming said in a soft voice, "Congratulations!"
Ye Xuan was puzzled, "What are you congratulating me for?"
Ye Zhiming was expressionless, "Congratulations for escaping from the underworld!"
Ye Xuan said, "You're not in a good mood?"
Ye Zhiming looked at Ye Xuan, "That sixth princess was killed by Mu Niannian?"
Ye Xuan nodded.
Ye Zhiming sighed, "What a monstrous woman!"
Ye Xuan said in a low voice, "Do you know much about Daoting?"
Ye Zhiming said in a soft voice, "Daoting is very strong, very strong!
Of the three thousand paths, at least eighty percent of the protectors are Daoting.
If not for the hindrance of the Dao Tomb, Daoting would be even stronger! "
Ye Xuan said in a low voice, "The Dao Tomb?"
Ye Zhiming nodded, "That's where some Dao Breakers stay. Their goal is to destroy Daoting!
Although they did not completely destroy the Dao Court, countless Great Daos collapsed because of them … It can be said that they almost destroyed the entire Dao Court back then. "
Ye Xuan frowned, "You said that you can't say anything about a place. Is it Daoting or the Dao Tomb?"
Ye Zhiming said, "The Dao Tomb!
But I can say it now! "
Ye Xuan was puzzled, "Why?"
Ye Zhiming said in a low voice, "Because you did something they approved of!"
Ye Xuan said in a low voice, "Killed the sixth princess?"
Ye Zhiming nodded.
Ye Xuan said in a low voice, "Can I form an alliance with the Dao Tomb?"
Ye Zhiming shook his head, "You'd better not!"
Ye Xuan was puzzled, "Why do you say that?"
Ye Zhiming said, "Because of the Dao Scripture!
The Dao Tomb will not give up on the Dao Scripture. "
Ye Xuan said in a low voice, "The Dao Scripture is that powerful?
They even want the Daoting and the Dao Tomb?
That shouldn't be the case!
They already have experts who have surpassed the Dao Vindication Realm, why would they still want the Dao Scripture?
It doesn't make sense! "
Ye Zhiming looked at Ye Xuan, "The Dao Scripture has nine scrolls!
The first one can allow one to achieve true Escape. The second one, Karma, allows one to understand karma, know fortune and misfortune, and turn misfortune into fortune. The third one allows one to understand the variables of the world, the rules of the Dao, and walk a path that belongs to them. That's how you got your Sword Transformation!
The fourth one, Fate, allows one to understand the Dao of Fate, their own fate, and the Dao's fate … This scroll allows one to understand the rules of the world, and this rule is a Dao law!
Mastering this Dao law is equivalent to having one's foot out of the chessboard! "
Saying this, she paused, then said, "Do you know why there are so many Dao Vindication experts in the Underworld?"
Ye Xuan said in a low voice, "The fifth scroll is in the Underworld?"
Ye Zhiming nodded, "The fifth scroll, Dao, is in the Underworld. That Dao Scripture can allow one to prove the Dao. After that, there are four more Dao Scriptures, one of which is in the Underworld, the legendary Imperial Dao, which can be used to control the Dao.
As for the remaining three Dao Scriptures … "
Saying this, she looked at Ye Xuan, "Do you know what will happen if the Dao Scripture is complete?"
Ye Xuan shook his head.
Ye Zhiming said, "If the Dao Scripture is complete, it is nine into one. The complete Dao Scripture is the peak of martial arts, and the origin of the entire martial arts civilization!
Be it the Saha World or the Daoting, their martial arts civilization originated from the Dao Scripture!
Most importantly, there is a peerless Dao Scripture martial art among them!
As for the Dao Tomb, although they chose their own Dao and chose Dao Breakers, it doesn't mean they don't want the Dao Scripture. Most importantly, they won't let the Dao Scripture become one! "
Ye Xuan was puzzled, "Why?"
Ye Zhiming said, "Rumor has it that once the Dao Scripture becomes one, there are no more Dao Breakers in the world!
Do you know why Dao Breakers appeared later, and more and more of them? "
Ye Xuan frowned, "Because of the Dao Scripture?"
Ye Zhiming nodded, "The Dao Scripture is equivalent to the general outline of the Three Thousand Great Daos. The Dao Scripture contains countless Great Daos, as well as the universe's truth and variables.
However, the Dao Scripture is divided into nine, so the Great Daos are not perfect!
Following that, Dao Breakers appeared!
If the Dao Scripture becomes one, the Great Daos become perfect again, which is a fatal threat to Dao Breakers!
Therefore, Dao Breakers won't let the Dao Scripture become one.
But you now have four Dao Scriptures!
To a certain extent, you're the one with the highest chance of fusing the Dao Scripture into one!
Once you do, then you'll be able to rule over the Three Thousand Great Daos. At that time, the Three Thousand Great Daos would be nothing before you, let alone the guardians of the Three Thousand Great Daos. "
As she spoke, she gazed at Ye Xuan, "The reason I'm following you is to gather all the Dao Scriptures!"
Ye Xuan spoke solemnly, "What happens after I gather all the Dao Scriptures?"
Ye Zhiming fell silent.
Ye Xuan chuckled, "It's fine if you don't want to tell me!
You can tell me when you want to in the future! "
Ye Zhiming glanced at Ye Xuan and said, "It's practically impossible to gather all the Dao Scriptures. Because the Dao Scripture itself is a scourge, and almost no one who obtains it comes to a good end!
Even the Underworld has lost countless experts in the past. According to what I know, the first Lord of the Underworld died mysteriously after obtaining two Dao Scriptures! "
As she spoke, she took a deep breath, "Later on, I discovered that the Dao Scripture itself is a form of karma, the karma of the Three Thousand Great Daos. Practically no one can endure this karma!
Except for you! "
Ye Xuan frowned slightly. "Me?"
Ye Zhiming gazed at Ye Xuan, "Because your backing is truly too powerful!"
As she spoke, she paused for a moment before she continued, "I reckon that the Cause of Disaster and the karma of the Three Thousand Great Daos is very aggrieved as well. Why did it encounter a second generation like you …"
...









Chapter 1328
In the courtyard, Ye Xuan was shocked.
Three Thousand Great Dao!
Dao Scripture!
All this while, he knew too little about Dao Scripture!
He never expected that this Dao Scripture was equivalent to the general outline of the Three Thousand Great Dao. If he gathered all the Dao Scripture, he could balance the Three Thousand Great Dao.
If he gathered all the Three Thousand Great Dao, wouldn't he be able to defecate on Daoting's head?
Ye Xuan shook his head with a bitter smile. Gather all the Dao Scripture?
How difficult would that be!
There was still the Dao Scripture in the Dao Tomb. Would they give it to him?
Moreover, Daoting wouldn't give him the time to search for the Dao Scripture!
As if thinking of something, Ye Xuan looked at Ye Zhiming, "Zhiming, since you know so much, do you know who the owner of the Dao Scripture is?"
The owner of the Dao Scripture!
If the Dao Scripture itself was already so terrifying, then how terrifying must the owner who wrote it be?
Unimaginable!
Ye Zhiming shook his head, "I don't know, but I know that the Dao Scripture came from the Whirling World!"
Ye Xuan asked, "Have you been to the Whirling World?"
Ye Zhiming shook his head, "No!
As far as I know, no one can go there. "
Ye Xuan was confused, "Why?"
Ye Zhiming said, "Because the entrance to the Whirling World is an Ascension Platform. To enter the Whirling World, one must have the Ascension Platform!"
Ascension Platform!
Ye Xuan whispered, "That means, Zhiming, you don't know much about that place?"
Ye Zhiming nodded.
After a moment of silence, Ye Xuan asked, "What about the Milky Way Realm?"
Ye Zhiming said, "I know where that place is, but I can't go there!"
Ye Xuan was confused, "Why?"
Ye Zhiming replied, "There's a formation guarding that place, and a very, very powerful one at that."
Ye Xuan said, "As far as I know, the Prophet has been there!"
Ye Zhiming nodded, "The Prophet has been there, but I don't know how he got there!"
Ye Xuan was silent.
Ye Zhiming said, "Your top priority now is to figure out how to deal with Daoting!
Daoting won't let the matter rest now that a Sixth Princess and a Divine General are dead, especially since you have the Dao Scripture. "
Ye Xuan shook his head. "I don't understand. Why didn't they come to snatch the Dao Scripture before, but after it fell into my hands, they all came to snatch it?"
Ye Zhiming looked at Ye Xuan, "Did no one snatch the prophet's scriptures?
As for others, just look at that Buddhist. He's afraid of others knowing that he has Daoist scriptures, but what about you?
Once you have the Dao Scripture, tell the entire universe that you have it!
Who else would they look for if not you? "
Ye Xuan was speechless.
Ye Zhiming said sternly, "Don't joke around. Daoting isn't that simple. Besides, the underworld will not let this matter rest!
Although the underworld can't do anything to Mu Niannian, you have to understand that Mu Niannian isn't in a good condition right now! "
Ye Xuan said solemnly, "Zhiming, do you know what injuries Nian Nian has suffered?"
Ye Zhiming shook his head, "I don't know!"
Ye Xuan frowned, "You don't know either?"
Ye Zhiming nodded, "She's very mysterious, and she's always joking around. No one can guess what she's really thinking!"
Ye Xuan fell silent.
Ye Zhiming was about to speak when a powerful soul aura suddenly burst out from Ye Xuan's body!
Both of them were stunned!
Ye Zhiming looked at Ye Xuan, "Yellow Springs Holy Water!"
Ye Xuan nodded, he had almost forgotten about this!
Mu Niannian had given him all the Yellow Springs Holy Water!
Previously, the Yellow Springs Holy Water had been healing his soul, and now that his soul had recovered, the Yellow Springs Holy Water actually began to strengthen his soul!
Ye Zhiming said solemnly, "Quickly sit down!"
Ye Xuan nodded and sat cross-legged on the ground. Around him, a powerful soul aura surged out like a tide!
Ye Zhiming hurriedly said, "Suppress!"
Ye Xuan said, "I can't suppress it!"
Ye Zhiming said solemnly, "Use that sword of yours!"
Ye Xuan hurriedly took out the Soul Suppressing Sword. As soon as the Soul Suppressing Sword appeared, a wave of soul energy that was even stronger than the one Ye Xuan emitted suddenly erupted from the battlefield!
Boom!
In an instant, a powerful soul aura shot up into the sky, piercing through the clouds. In an instant, the entire sky above the city turned pitch black!
The entire Fifth Dimension Alliance was shocked!
Countless experts looked over!
In the courtyard, Ye Zhiming's expression was somewhat ugly. Not only was Ye Xuan unable to suppress the soul aura, the Soul Suppressing Sword was also unable to suppress it!
The sword had absorbed too many powerful souls!
The power was so strong that it had already lost control!
As if thinking of something, Ye Zhiming hurriedly turned to look at the sky, "San Sheng, what are you looking at!
Quickly come and help! "
A black light flashed, and soon, San Sheng appeared in front of Ye Zhiming.
Ye Zhiming pointed at Ye Xuan and the Soul Suppressing Sword, "Help him suppress it!"
Dao San Sheng nodded and walked in front of Ye Xuan, placing a hand on Ye Xuan's head.
Boom!
Three powerful forces suddenly began to slowly suppress Ye Xuan!
Gradually, the soul aura within Ye Xuan's body began to calm down, but the Soul Suppressing Sword's aura grew stronger and stronger!
San Sheng looked at the Soul Suppressing Sword, opened his palm, and lightly pressed it down!
Boom!
A powerful force suddenly shook San Sheng to the point that he was forced to retreat several hundred feet!
A trace of shock flashed across Ye Zhiming's eyes. San Sheng's strength could be said to be the strongest in the Fifth Dimension apart from Mu Niannian, but she was actually pushed back by this sword?
As if thinking of something, Ye Zhiming looked at Ye Xuan, "Your sword couldn't have absorbed the Divine Souls of the Sixth Princess and the Heavenly General, right?"
Ye Xuan nodded, "Yes!
Not only that, but it also absorbed the souls of dozens of Dao Validation experts from the Underworld! "
Dozens of Dao Validation experts' souls!
Ye Zhiming inhaled a breath of cold air, "You guys are really abnormal!"
This was too crazy!
Dozens of Dao Validation experts!
Moreover, it had absorbed the souls of the Sixth Princess and the Heavenly General!
Both of them were at the legendary Dao Defense Realm!
Ye Zhiming looked at the Soul Suppressing Sword, "This sword is going to defy the heavens!"
As she spoke, she looked at Ye Xuan, "Hurry up and suppress the Divine Soul energy in your body, then suppress this sword yourself!"
Ye Xuan nodded and glanced at the Soul Suppressing Sword. The sword's aura was still crazily increasing. Previously in the Underworld, with Mu Niannian's suppression, this sword could still remain calm, but at this moment, it was completely released!
Ye Xuan did not think too much about it and began to focus on absorbing the power of the Yellow Springs Holy Water in his body!
He knew that if he completely absorbed the power of the Yellow Springs Holy Water, his Divine Soul would become abnormally powerful!
About an hour later, the entire sky was covered in darkness, filled with the soul aura released by the Soul Suppressing Sword. At this moment, the Soul Suppressing Sword had reached an extremely terrifying level!
At this moment, Ye Xuan suddenly stood up and clenched his right hand. In an instant, ripples appeared in the space around him.
Soul energy!
Right now, he could easily kill a Self Release expert with just his soul!
As if thinking of something, Ye Xuan looked at the Soul Suppressing Sword in front of him and grabbed it.
Boom!
Ye Xuan's body trembled violently. At this moment, he felt endless soul energy!
What a powerful force!
Ye Xuan greedily took a deep breath. If he were to fight with the King of the Underworld now, he was 100% confident that he could kill him head-on!
Unfortunately, the King of the Underworld had already been killed by Mu Niannian!
Ye Xuan raised his head and looked at the soul energy in the sky. He pointed his sword towards the sky. "Withdraw!"
Boom!
In an instant, countless soul energy swept down from the sky and surged towards him and the Soul Suppressing Sword!
Just like that, one man and one sword crazily absorbed the soul energy!
At the side, Ye Zhiming's expression became somewhat strange.
The current Ye Xuan could be said to be the true nemesis of the Underworld!
Other than those top-notch experts, there was basically no one in the Underworld who was a match for Ye Xuan. This sword platform restrained the Underworld!
After a long time, the Soul Suppressing Sword and Ye Xuan both calmed down. Ye Xuan looked at Ye Zhiming and asked excitedly, "Ye Zhiming, what level is this sword at?"
Ye Zhiming said solemnly, "At least the Dao Validation realm!"
Ye Xuan frowned slightly. "It's still not at the Dao Defense realm?"
Ye Zhiming rolled his eyes at Ye Xuan. "The Dao Defense realm?
What are you thinking?
Do you think you can reach the Dao Defense realm just by absorbing the souls of two Dao Defense realm experts?
It's not like that. If you want to reach the Dao Defense realm, you have to cultivate on your own.
Also, don't underestimate the Dao Validation realm. The sword in your hand is equivalent to a Dao Validation realm expert. With it and you together, it's not as simple as one plus one. It can be said that if the two of you join forces, you can completely pose a fatal threat to a Dao Defense realm expert! "
The Dao Validation realm!
Ye Xuan was silent.
If he were to fight the Sixth Princess with this sword, then he was very confident in his ability to kill the Sixth Princess. Of course, he wouldn't be able to win if he were to fight the Divine General!
The Divine General had no weaknesses, but the Sixth Princess had a lot of weaknesses!
Ye Xuan sheathed the Soul Suppressing Sword and looked at Ye Zhiming. He was about to speak when a powerful pressure suddenly appeared in the distant starry sky.
Ye Xuan's expression changed when he saw this, and he vanished on the spot in the next moment.
In the field, Ye Zhiming frowned. "So fast?"
Dao Sansheng spoke solemnly, "What a powerful aura!"
Ye Zhiming nodded, "It should be them!"
....
A ray of light flashed in the starry sky, and Ye Xuan appeared by Mu Niannian's side in the next moment. An old man stood not too far away from Mu Niannian. The old man's hair and beard were all white, and he wore a spotless white robe. He held a white horsetail whisk in his hand.
A sage-like demeanor!
That was Ye Xuan's first impression!
The white-robed old man glanced at Ye Xuan, then at Mu Niannian, and smiled, "I'm Bai Dizi. Nice to meet you, Miss!"
Mu Niannian smiled, "Emperor Bai Xing, the leader of the Celestial Lords. It seems that the Daoting thinks highly of us this time!"
The white-robed old man was surprised, "Miss, you know who I am?"
Mu Niannian nodded, "I know Dao Yi a little."
The white-robed old man smiled, "Miss, would you like to hear the Dao Ancestor's conditions?"
Mu Niannian smiled, "Tell me about it!"
The white-robed old man said, "The Dao Ancestor decrees that if you are willing to surrender and bring this little brother's head and scripture as a gift, you can let bygones be bygones!"
Mu Niannian laughed, then looked at Ye Xuan, "What do you think?"
Ye Xuan looked at Bai Dizi, "I want to surrender too. Can you give me a chance?"
Bai Dizi was taken aback, then shook his head, "We don't accept people who don't have anything to eat!"
F * ck!
Ye Xuan's face darkened.

Chapter 1329
Freeloader!
Ye Xuan's face darkened. This is too much!
Mu Niannian, on the other hand, burst into laughter.
Bai Dizi looked at Mu Niannian and smiled, "Miss, it's not easy to cultivate to this point. If you join my Daoting, you will surely reach a higher level."
Mu Niannian smiled, "What if I don't join?"
Bai Dizi looked at Mu Niannian, "Tens of thousands of years of cultivation will go up in smoke!"
Mu Niannian smiled, "I'll be waiting!"
Bai Dizi smiled, "Miss, your strength is unparalleled, but you're still a person!"
Mu Niannian looked at Bai Dizi and smiled, "I'm used to being unrestrained!"
Bai Dizi smiled, "Understood!"
Having said that, he turned and disappeared into the horizon.
Mu Niannian continued to roast fish.
Ye Xuan said in a deep voice, "They won't give up, will they?"
Mu Niannian rolled her eyes at Ye Xuan, "Aren't you talking nonsense?"
Ye Xuan asked, "Sister Nian, how strong is Daoting?"
Mu Niannian shook her head, "I don't know!"
Ye Xuan frowned, "You don't know?"
Mu Niannian smiled, "I haven't investigated!"
Ye Xuan's face sank.
Mu Niannian suddenly said, "Just do your own thing!"
Ye Xuan nodded, "Alright!"
Having said that, he turned and left.
Not long after Ye Xuan left, Ye Zhiming suddenly appeared.
Ye Zhiming looked at Mu Niannian, "You're really not afraid of Daoting!"
Mu Niannian smiled, "What are you trying to say?"
Ye Zhiming said, "Why are you so fearless?
Is it because of self-confidence or something else? "
Mu Niannian stood up with the grilled fish in her hand. She looked up at the end of the starry sky. "People of the Big Abyss, do you think this universe has an end?"
Ye Zhiming shook his head.
Even she did not know where the end of the universe was.
Mu Niannian smiled. "In this boundless universe, there are too many unknowns!"
"What are you trying to say?" Ye Zhiming asked in a deep voice.
Mu Niannian stretched his body and smiled. "The universe is huge, but I'm not interested in exploring it!
I should say that I lost interest a long time ago! "
As she spoke, she glanced at the starry sky around her and said softly, "This is my home!"
"You still haven't answered my question!" Ye Zhiming growled.
Mu Niannian blinked. "I've already answered!"
With that, she turned around and left.
On the spot, Ye Zhiming frowned slightly …
...
The Underworld.
Bai Dizi did not return to Daoting directly. Instead, she went to the Underworld.
Inside the Dark Spirit Hall, the Lord of the Underworld looked at Bai Dizi in front of him. "She didn't agree?"
Bai Dizi nodded.
The Lord of the Underworld said softly, "As expected!
How could a powerhouse like her surrender so easily? "
As he spoke, he looked at Bai Dizi. "You must have another purpose for this trip, right?"
Bai Dizi nodded. "I just wanted to see how strong she is!"
The Lord of the Underworld asked, "Can you tell?"
Bai Dizi said softly, "I can't tell!"
The Lord of the Underworld narrowed his eyes. "Even you can't tell?"
Bai Dizi nodded.
The Lord of the Underworld was silent.
Bai Di smiled.
Bai Dizi chuckled. "However, I have a new discovery."
The Lord of the Underworld looked at Bai Dizi. Bai Dizi smiled and said, "She is a Fifth Dimension Tendo. I found that her power seems to have some kind of connection with the Fifth Dimension Universe. If I'm not wrong, her power may originate from that Fifth Dimension Universe. As far as I know, this Fifth Dimension Universe is about to experience a disaster.
This is the best time for us to kill her. "
The Lord of the Underworld frowned slightly. "Us?"
Bai Dizi looked at the Lord of the Underworld and smiled. "Does the Underworld not want that Dao Stone anymore?"
The Lord of the Underworld was silent.
Bai Dizi said again, "Dozens of powerhouses of the Underworld were killed. Does the Underworld not want to take revenge?"
The Lord of the Underworld smiled. "Of course I want to take revenge. However, if the price is too high, what's the point of taking revenge?"
Bai Dizi chuckled. "The Lord of the Underworld should know the position of the Sixth Princess in the Daoting. That woman not only killed the Sixth Princess, but also absorbed her soul. This is equivalent to stepping on the face of the Daoting. I, the Daoting, will not let this go. If the Dao Ancestor and the others were not restrained by the Dao Tomb, it would not be this old man who came this time."
The Lord of the Underworld was silent.
Bai Dizi suddenly smiled. "If you can absorb that Dao Stone …"
The Lord of the Underworld narrowed his eyes. After a long silence, he said softly, "This matter needs to be considered at length!"
Bai Dizi nodded. "Of course!"
...
The Fifth Dimension Universe.
In the room, Ye Xuan was looking at an ancient book.
This was left for him by the Prophet. In this ancient book, it was all the ideas of the Prophet to govern the world.
The Prophet's idea was very simple: the universe coexisted with all living things.
In order to achieve this, humans and the other races had to control themselves. They could not wantonly destroy the Spiritual Qi of this world.
Not only that, but they also had to protect the Spiritual Qi of this world and all kinds of spiritual objects!
Simply put, it was like the Sixth Dimension Universe.
However, it was very difficult for the Fifth Dimension Universe to be like the Sixth Dimension Universe.
This was because the Sixth Dimension Universe was equivalent to giving up the opportunity for most people to ascend. The current Fifth Dimension Universe definitely could not do this. Those people had already cultivated to a certain level. If you asked them to suddenly give up their cultivation, how could they be willing?
The Prophet's idea was very simple!
There could be no construction without destruction!
After the Fifth Dimension Calamity, countless creatures in this universe would die tragically. At that time, this universe could be reborn.
Ye Xuan suddenly put down the ancient book and looked up at the starry sky. Did Sister Nian also have the same idea?
In the room, Ye Xuan did not speak for a long time.
After a while, Ye Xuan walked out of the main hall. He looked at the city. There were more and more experts in the Fifth Dimension Universe now!
The entire Fifth Dimension Universe was very excited!
This was because everyone's strength had increased!
At this moment, Ye Xuan already saw the drawbacks.
The increasing number of experts was actually not a particularly good thing for this universe. This was because this universe could not withstand so many powerful people.
After pondering for a long time, Ye Xuan suddenly laughed. "I was stupid!
Why did I see these experts as a burden? "
After saying this, he shook his head and laughed. Then, he disappeared.
In the starry sky, Ye Xuan found Mu Niannian.
Mu Niannian glanced at the ancient book in Ye Xuan's hands. "The Prophet?"
Ye Xuan nodded. "I've finished reading it!
His idea was the same as Sister Nian's, right? "
Mu Niannian nodded. "In fact, he was originally the person I wanted to choose. However, his ambition was too big. Moreover, he did not listen to my advice, so he is gone!"
Ye Xuan: "…"
Mu Niannian looked down and softly said, "The current strength of the Fifth Dimension Universe is unprecedentedly powerful. Have you ever thought about what would happen if these experts survived the Fifth Dimension Tribulation?
At that time, these experts will become a burden to the Fifth Dimension Universe. Their existence will still accelerate the destruction of the Fifth Dimension Tribulation. In other words, there will be another Fifth Dimension Tribulation, and the one after that … "
Ye Xuan said in a deep voice, "Sister Nian and the Prophet's idea is to use the Fifth Dimension Tribulation to eliminate the majority of people?"
Mu Niannian laughed. "I didn't think about it that much. However, the Prophet indeed had this idea!"
After saying this, she glanced at Ye Xuan. "Do you have any other ideas?"
Ye Xuan nodded. "I have an idea. I want to hear Sister Nian's opinion."
Mu Niannian said, "Tell me about it!"
Ye Xuan pointed down. "If these experts stay here, they will become a burden to this universe. But what if they leave?"
Mu Niannian blinked. "Leave?"
Ye Xuan nodded. "Once the Fifth Dimension Tribulation ends, I will let the top experts of this universe leave the Fifth Dimension and let them develop outside. However, I want to tell them that the Fifth Dimension is their home. No matter where they go, the Fifth Dimension will still be their home.
This way, these people will not be a burden to the Fifth Dimension, but a super external aid to the Fifth Dimension. As long as the Fifth Dimension Tribulation is in trouble, these people will come back from all directions. "
Mu Niannian laughed. "Why would they come back?"
Ye Xuan smiled proudly. "Dao Scripture!
After I let them leave, I will tell them that as long as they reach a certain level, they can come back to the Fifth Dimension. Then, I will use Dao Scripture to help them break through.
This way, who wouldn't treat the Fifth Dimension as their home? "
Mu Niannian looked at Ye Xuan. After a moment, she faintly smiled. "Genius!"
Benefits!
The only thing that could tie down these super experts was benefits!
Just like the reason why the Fifth Dimension was unprecedentedly united. Even the Dao World had joined the Fifth Dimension. Why?
Because of benefits!
Dao Scripture was benefits!
For the Dao Scripture, all the top experts were willing to unite. Similarly, for the Dao Scripture, these super experts were also willing to treat the Fifth Dimension as their home and protect it.
Ye Xuan continued, "Of course, I won't help them break through for free. I will ask them to help me look for those spiritual beings in the universe after they leave. I will ask them to trick those spiritual beings back to our Five Dimensional Universe!
In other words, if the Fifth Dimension is good, then everyone is good. "
Mu Niannian looked at Ye Xuan and smiled. "You can do it!"
Ye Xuan smiled. "I will definitely do it!"
After saying this, he looked down and smiled. "Sister Nian, it will be very tiring for you to protect the entire universe by yourself. However, if all the living beings in the Fifth Dimension come together to protect it, then you can relax!
The universe is so big. At that time, you will be able to look around!
At the same time, you can also trick a few spirits back. "
Mu Niannian laughed heartily. She laughed very loudly, and laughed very happily …
Ye Xuan looked at Mu Niannian and did not say anything.
After a long time, Mu Niannian looked at Ye Xuan and smiled. "The universe is so big. We can look around. This idea is very tempting!"
Ye Xuan smiled. "I also want to look around!"
Mu Niannian suddenly pulled Ye Xuan's hand and smiled. "Accompany Sister Nian for a walk and chat."
Ye Xuan blinked. "Is there any benefit?"
Mu Niannian also blinked. "I heard that your body is very hard. Do you want to try Sister Nian's fist?
Don't worry, Sister Nian will kill you with one punch. You won't have to suffer any physical pain! "
Ye Xuan was speechless.

Chapter 1330
In the starry sky, Ye Xuan and Mu Niannian were walking slowly.
The two were simply chatting!
In fact, most of the time, it was Mu Niannian who was talking.
Mu Niannian and Ye Xuan talked about some secret and interesting things about the Five-Dimensional Universe from the early days of its birth to the present, including how she started cultivating.
Ye Xuan listened with great interest.
Mu Niannian's life was actually very legendary.
It must be known that she was just an ordinary Tendo at that time, the target of the Five-Dimensional Universe's defiance.
The two of them chatted for half a day!
After Ye Xuan and Mu Niannian parted, he returned to his room. He opened his palm and the book appeared in his hand.
This was the book left behind by the Prophet!
And just now, Sister Nian had given him this book!
With his current strength, he could already open it!
Ye Xuan took out the Prison Pagoda and looked at the book. "If you tell this father that your strength is not enough, this father will beat you to death!"
After saying that, he pointed with his fingers and the Prison Pagoda directly entered the book.
There was a moment of silence.
Boom!
A powerful aura suddenly erupted from the book. Soon, a white light suddenly gushed out. Ye Xuan hesitated for a moment before walking into the white light.
After entering the white light, Ye Xuan came to a book. He was surrounded by bookshelves, and these bookshelves were filled with all kinds of ancient books.
This was the book?
Ye Xuan looked around. At this time, he saw a desk not far in front of him. On the desk, there was a scroll.
Ye Xuan walked to the desk and picked up the scroll.
Dao Scripture!
Escape Scroll!
Ye Xuan opened the scroll, and familiar words appeared in front of his eyes. "Fifty Great Daos, Forty-Nine Heavenly Divination …"
Escape Scroll!
Ye Xuan put away the Escape Scroll and looked around. Didn't the Prophet say that there was something dangerous here?
How could it not be?
Right at this moment, a certain bookshelf suddenly started trembling. Ye Xuan looked at the bookshelf and sized it up before he said, "Are you coming out?"
At this moment, the bookcase suddenly split open, and a small gourd floated out.
Ye Xuan looked at the small gourd and was secretly on guard.
The Prophet had said that it was very dangerous!
After the small gourd swayed for a while, a voice suddenly came from within. "You are a prophet!
No, you're not! "
The voice was a little childish, and it was hard to tell if it was a man or a woman.
Ye Xuan blinked. "Who are you?"
The little gourd said, "I am the Great Gourd Deity!"
Immortal Gourd?
Ye Xuan frowned. "I've never heard of it!"
"Ignorant!"
The voice shouted angrily: "I am the number one divine artifact of Saha world, the Heaven and Earth gourd"
The Whirling World!
Ye Xuan's eyelids twitched.
Damn it!
This was a trap!
This was Ye Xuan's first impression!
How did I provoke the underworld?
It's the Three Lives!
The Three Lives is the number one divine artifact of the underworld!
And now this Heaven and Earth gourd?
The number one divine artifact of Saha world?
Damn it! Am I going to go against the Whirling World again?
What the hell!
I don't want to!
Ye Xuan hurriedly said, "Great Gourd Deity, why are you here?"
Great Gourd Deity said coldly, "The Prophet said that this world is fun, and he brought me out!"
The Prophet tricked me!
The corners of Ye Xuan's mouth twitched. He hesitated for a moment and said, "The Prophet is gone!"
The Gourd Immortal said, "I know. He was taken by a very, very powerful woman.
He was killed by a very powerful woman! "
Qing 'er!
Ye Xuan's eyelids twitched. "How do you know?"
Great Gourd Deity said, "I was beaten up by that woman!"
Ye Xuan: "…"
Great Gourd Deity said, "You were beaten up really badly!"
Ye Xuan's expression became slightly strange. "You couldn't defeat that woman?"
Great Gourd Deity said angrily, "How could I not defeat her?"
Ye Xuan blinked. "You could?"
Great Gourd Deity said after a moment of silence, "I was evenly matched with her!"
Ye Xuan: "…"
Great Gourd Deity said, "You should know that I was very weak back then because I had just broken the enchantment of the Whirling World. I was not at my peak!
If I was at my peak, humph, to put it bluntly, that woman wouldn't even have the chance to draw her sword! "
Ye Xuan's expression was calm. Great Gourd Deity was not just bluntly arrogant, it was extremely arrogant!
Great Gourd Deity suddenly jumped up and down. "I'm free now!
Mm, I'll follow you from now on! "
Ye Xuan's eyelids twitched. "Why do you want to follow me?"
Great Gourd Deity said, "Who else would I follow if not you?"
Ye Xuan hesitated for a moment and said, "Why don't you go back?"
In fact, he really wanted to say, "Don't f * cking bring the Whirling World here!
I really can't take it anymore! "
Great Gourd Deity suddenly jumped up. "I'm not going back!
I'm not going back! "
Ye Xuan frowned. "Why?"
Great Gourd Deity said angrily, "It's not fun to go back!"
Ye Xuan thought for a moment and said, "Why don't you go play on the Daoting?"
Great Gourd Deity was curious. "What is Daoting?"
Ye Xuan said seriously, "It's a very fun place!"
Great Gourd Deity suddenly jumped in front of Ye Xuan. "Human, do you not want me to follow you?"
Ye Xuan spread his hands. "There's no point in you following me!
I don't play often!
Besides, I have a lot of enemies!
It's very dangerous! "
"Very dangerous?"
Great Gourd Deity said excitedly, "Danger is good!
Danger is fun!
I want to follow you! "
Ye Xuan almost fainted!
Great Gourd Deity said again, "Human, did you know that it was the Prophet who begged me to follow him?"
Ye Xuan thought for a moment and said, "Why did the Prophet ask you to follow him?
Or rather, did he ask you to do anything? "
Great Gourd Deity said, "He asked me to play with him!"
Ye Xuan said in a low voice, "Are you good at fighting?"
Great Gourd Deity said angrily, "Of course I am!
Let me tell you, other than that woman in a plain dress, there's no one that I'm afraid of! "
Ye Xuan blinked. "How so?"
Great Gourd Deity suddenly said, "Heaven and Earth are infinite, and the power of the universe is born from the heart. The Lord of Taiyi, as urgent as the law, withdraw!"
A powerful force suddenly enveloped Ye Xuan, and in the next instant, Ye Xuan disappeared on the spot.
In the blink of an eye, Ye Xuan appeared in the gourd!
Ye Xuan glanced at the surroundings, and his brows knit together slightly. He was about to speak when his body actually started to melt bit by bit!
Ye Xuan's expression instantly changed when he witnessed this scene, and he hurriedly activated the Buddha Invincible Physique. However, it was actually useless, and his body was still melting incessantly!
Ye Xuan's face fell, and then he withdrew the Executing Heaven Sword and slashed it forward.
Hiss!
A ray of light flashed. However, it wasn't even able to strike the bottle gourd before it was melted away!
Ye Xuan's expression instantly changed when he witnessed this scene.
What gourd is that?
It's actually able to melt my sword energy!
Meanwhile, Great Gourd Deity's voice suddenly resounded.
A voice suddenly rang out. "Do you have any other moves?"
Ye Xuan thought for a moment, and then he suddenly clenched his fists. In an instant, a strand of formidable energy started to converge around him!
A Daoist scripture and martial technique!
However, he noticed to his astonishment that the energy started to melt as soon as it converged!
At this moment, Ye Xuan was truly shocked!
That gourd is terrifying!
It can even melt the energy of a Dao scripture!
How could it be so heaven defying?
Meanwhile, Immortal Gourd chuckled, "Do you have any other moves?"
Ye Xuan thought for a moment, and then the seal of a god suddenly appeared between his brows. In the next moment, his aura suddenly rose explosively.
Bang!
In an instant, Ye Xuan had attained the Dao Verification Realm!
After he attained the Dao Verification Realm, he opened his palm, and the Executing Heaven Sword appeared in his grasp once more. He slashed with it!
Hiss!
A strand of sword energy tore through the sky. This time, it didn't vanish, and it struck the gourd instead. However, the gourd was completely unharmed!
Ye Xuan thought for a moment, and then he suddenly clenched his fists. In an instant, a strand of formidable energy suddenly converged!
After he attained the Dao Verification Realm, the might of this technique could be said to have multiplied!
This time, although the power of the Dao scripture martial arts was also slowly melting, the speed of melting was much slower.
After a moment of silence, Ye Xuan suddenly slashed forward.
Rumble!
A powerful force suddenly erupted from the gourd, and in an instant, the entire gourd trembled violently. However, after around 10 minutes, the gourd returned to its original calm state, and the energy of the technique within the gourd had completely melted away!
Within the gourd, Ye Xuan fell silent, and he was extremely shocked!
Damn it, this gourd is too heaven-defying!
That move of his just now could directly destroy a small world!
But this gourd is completely unharmed!
Isn't that too terrifying?
At this moment, Immortal Gourd suddenly chuckled, "So long as you enter this place, no matter how strong your opponent is, they will slowly melt into a pool of blood!"
Ye Xuan said, "So long as you don't enter it, it'll be fine, right?"
Immortal Gourd said, "Yes!"
Ye Xuan understood now.
Fighting against this gourd, one cannot enter it!
When the gourd was chanting, he could actually resist its energy. So long as he didn't enter it, the gourd couldn't do anything to him. But if he entered it, then he couldn't do anything to the gourd, and he could only wait for death!
At this moment, Ye Xuan seemed to have thought of something, and he opened his palm. In next to no time, the blood within his body started to boil, and then a powerful bloodline energy appeared around him.
But Ye Xuan noticed that the gourd wasn't able to melt away his bloodline energy!
The corners of Ye Xuan's mouth curled up slightly when he saw this. It seems like not everything can be melted away by this gourd.
But even so, it's still very heaven-defying!
Meanwhile, Immortal Gourd suddenly said, "Your bloodline energy is so strong!"
Ye Xuan laughed and said, "Immortal Gourd, I'll take you to see someone!"
Immortal Gourd asked, "Who?"
Ye Xuan blinked, "You'll know when you get there!"
A moment later, Ye Xuan left the study with the Great Gourd Immortal. Then he brought the Great Gourd Immortal to Mu Niannian.
When they saw Immortal Gourd, Mu Niannian looked at Ye Xuan, "From the Whirling World?"
Ye Xuan nodded.
Mu Niannian suddenly clutched her chest. Ye Xuan quickly asked, "Sister Nian, what's wrong?"
Sister Nian shook her head, "My chest hurts …"
Ye Xuan was puzzled, "Why does your chest suddenly hurt?"
Mu Niannian looked at Ye Xuan, "I'm angry!"
Ye Xuan, "…"
...









Chapter 1331
In the starry sky, Mu Niannian glanced at Ye Xuan and sighed. "I didn't expect you to be involved with the Whirling World again!"
Ye Xuan smiled. "Sister Nian, this gourd is very powerful!"
Mu Niannian glanced at the gourd in Ye Xuan's hand. "The Qiankun Gourd!"
Ye Xuan blinked. "Sister Nian knows it?"
Mu Niannian sized up the gourd. "How did you escape from the Whirling World?"
Gourd Immortal snorted. "Who are you?
Why should I answer you? "
Ye Xuan: "…"
At this moment, Mu Niannian suddenly disappeared.
Gourd Immortal suddenly laughed. "How dare you come in!
This Great Immortal will let you see … Ah … "
Meanwhile, numerous shrill and miserable cries suddenly resounded.
The gourd trembled violently in the starry sky.
Ye Xuan knew that the gourd had been hammered!
After a long time, the gourd completely withered!
At this moment, Mu Niannian appeared beside Ye Xuan and clapped her hands. "You're asking for a beating!"
Gourd Immortal trembled. "Who … Who are you!"
Mu Niannian said indifferently, "How did you escape?"
Gourd Immortal asked again, "Woman, who are you?"
Mu Niannian smiled and rubbed her hands. "Do you want to be beaten again?"
Gourd Immortal hurriedly said, "I sneaked out!"
Mu Niannian fell silent.
Ye Xuan looked at Mu Niannian. "Should I send it back?"
Gourd Immortal hurriedly said, "No, no!
Brother, don't send me back. I'll follow you, okay? "
Ye Xuan: "…"
Mu Niannian suddenly said softly, "Forget it!
Let it follow you!
It will be very useful to you in the short term! "
Ye Xuan hesitated, then said: "Whirling World …"
Mu Niannian chuckled. "Since it's delivered to my doorstep, it would be a waste not to take it!"
Ye Xuan smiled bitterly. "I'm afraid that the Saha World will come and beat me up!"
Mu Niannian looked at Ye Xuan. "What will come will come!"
Ye Xuan was speechless.
Mu Niannian suddenly looked up at the sky and said softly, "Daoting should be moving soon!
You have to be mentally prepared! "
Ye Xuan looked up at the depths of the starry sky. How would Daoting deal with the Five-Dimensional Universe this time?
If it was him, how would he deal with the Five-Dimensional Universe?
As if he had thought of something, Ye Xuan suddenly said, "Sister Nian, let's chat another day!"
With that, he turned around and disappeared below.
Mu Niannian glanced at Ye Xuan, who had disappeared from his sight, and shook his head with a smile. "Little guy …"
...
Ye Xuan returned to the Five-Dimensional Hall. He looked for Guan Yin and Senior Sister Lu of the Sword Sect.
Ye Xuan looked at the two of them. "Guan Yin, Senior Sister Lu, I have something I need you to do!"
Guan Yin was curious. "What is it?"
Ye Xuan also called Xiao Ling 'er out and said in a deep voice. "Find the Sword Sect!"
Sword Sect?
Guan Yin frowned slightly. "What do you mean?"
Senior Sister Lu also looked at Ye Xuan. She was puzzled.
Ye Xuan smiled. "I came here from the lower world and have seen many Sword Sect. The founder of these Sword Sect is the same person, the man in green robe!"
Senior Sister Lu suddenly said. "I know. It was founded by some of his fellow disciples. Some of them survived!
But some have disappeared in the long river of history. "
Ye Xuan nodded. "There must be other relics of the Sword Sect."
Senior Sister Lu said in a deep voice. "What do you want to do?"
Ye Xuan said. "Find the box!
！”
Box!
Hearing these two words, Xiao Ling 'er's eyes suddenly lit up.
Senior Sister Lu looked at Ye Xuan. "That little guy's box!"
Ye Xuan nodded. "According to my guess, that little guy is very playful. So, she must have left a box somewhere else, and that box will be of great help to us!"
Guan Yin was a little confused, but Senior Sister Lu was very clear on what was going on.
The box left by the white little guy was not ordinary!
Senior Sister Lu said after a moment of silence. "I know of a Sword Sect relic!"
Hearing this, Ye Xuan was a little excited. "Come, let's go!"
Senior Sister Lu nodded.
Ye Xuan gazed at Guan Yin. "Send someone to search throughout the entire Fifth Dimension. Don't let go of those minor worlds and remote worlds. Notify me immediately if you find any relics of the Sword Sect!"
Guan Yin nodded. "Alright!
I'll do it right away! "
As soon as she finished speaking, she turned around and left.
It didn't take long for countless experts to start searching for the relics of the Sword Sect throughout the Fifth Dimension …
After Guan Yin left, Ye Xuan suddenly gazed at Senior Sister Lu and said, "Senior Sister Lu, help me look at something!"
As soon as he finished speaking, he waved his right hand, and an ice coffin suddenly appeared here.
Senior Sister Lu frowned slightly. "What's that?"
Ye Xuan spoke in a low voice. "A mysterious senior gave it to me. He said that the green clothed man asked him to protect it, and he gave it to me when the time came!"
Senior Sister Lu gazed at Ye Xuan. "He left it behind?"
Ye Xuan nodded. "Do you know who's in the coffin?"
Senior Sister Lu asked, "Can I open it?"
Ye Xuan shook his head. "No, there's a powerful sword energy within the coffin.
Moreover … opening it like this isn't particularly respectful to the person within the coffin! "
Actually, he wasn't afraid of the sword energy because the Sword Spirit was there.
However, opening it like this was too abrupt.
Senior Sister Lu gazed at the coffin for a long time before she spoke softly. "I think I know who it is!"
Ye Xuan hurriedly asked. "Who?"
Senior Sister Lu glanced at Ye Xuan. "You'll know when the time comes!"
Ye Xuan was speechless.
Senior Sister Lu said, "Protect this coffin well. Your family owes it to them!"
Ye Xuan frowned slightly. "My family?"
Senior Sister Lu spoke indifferently. "In any case, it's a form of karma. Just protect it well!"
Ye Xuan was speechless. Senior Sister Lu also liked to whet his appetite!
As if thinking of something, Ye Xuan took out a token. This was given to him by the mysterious powerhouse in the Land of Origin, who said that he could do him a favor!
When he was in the underworld, he wanted to use this token. However, he didn't choose to use it in the end because at that time, even if he called a Dao Validation powerhouse, it would be useless!
According to his guess, that mysterious powerhouse should be a Dao Validation powerhouse!
Now, he needed to use all the power he could to fight against Daoting!
At this moment, Senior Sister Lu suddenly said, "Let's go to the Sword Sect ruins!"
Ye Xuan nodded. He put away the ice coffin and disappeared from the hall with Senior Sister Lu.
...
In the vast starry sky, Ye Xuan and Senior Sister Lu flew on their swords.
Ye Xuan suddenly said, "Senior Sister Lu, can you contact the founder of the Sword Sect?"
Senior Sister Lu shook her head. "I can't!"
Ye Xuan was silent.
Senior Sister Lu smiled. "You don't have the confidence to face it yourself?"
Ye Xuan said softly, "The world is difficult. I don't want to struggle anymore!"
Senior Sister Lu: "…"
Ye Xuan suddenly smiled. "Senior Sister Lu, other forces can summon their founder. Why can't the Sword Sect do the same?"
Senior Sister Lu smiled. "They already did it once!"
Ye Xuan was silent.
He knew it was the woman with the spear!
Senior Sister Lu suddenly said, "Can you reach the Dao Validation realm?"
Ye Xuan shook his head.
He still couldn't reach the Dao Validation realm. He could only rely on the God's Seal to reach the Dao Validation realm!
And this borrowed power was still inferior to the power he cultivated!
But he also knew that this matter couldn't be rushed!
Without thinking too much, Ye Xuan and Senior Sister Lu sped up!
...
In the Fifth Dimension.
In the courtyard, Ye Zhiming, who was reading a book, suddenly stopped. She turned her head and saw a man standing not far away.
Ye Zhiming said calmly, "Benxu, you are quite patient. You only came out now!"
The man named Benxu walked to Ye Zhiming's side and said in a deep voice, "The Patriarch has ordered us to bring you back!"
Ye Zhiming said softly, "Benxu, you have followed me for so long. You should have some understanding of Young Master Ye, right?"
Benxu said in a deep voice, "That Young Master Ye is a genius … rare in the world!"
Ye Zhiming looked at Benxu. "Go back and tell him that I won't go back."
Benxu hesitated for a moment and said, "The Patriarch has said, dead or alive!"
Dead or alive!
Ye Zhiming sneered. "Dead or alive? It seems that the Dao Scriptures are always more important to him than the people around him!"
Speaking of this, she suddenly thought of Ye Xuan!
She thought of the scene when Ye Xuan gave her two Dao Scriptures in the netherworld.
Her biological father couldn't be compared to a man she had only known for a few months!
Two Dao Scriptures!
If they were in Da Yuan, her father would have been willing to sacrifice the entire clan!
What about Ye Xuan?
Thinking of Ye Xuan, Ye Zhiming suddenly shook her head and smiled. At this moment, her heart felt warm.
Benxu sighed softly. "Sorry!"
With that, he was about to attack when a woman suddenly appeared behind him.
It was San Sheng!
Seeing San Sheng, Benxu's expression changed drastically.
San Sheng looked at Benxu. "You want to fight?"
Benxu looked at San Sheng with fear in his eyes.
San Sheng looked at Ye Zhiming not far away. "He told me that someone might be looking for trouble with you. I didn't believe it at first, but I didn't expect it to be true!"
At this moment, a sword light suddenly appeared in the field. It was Aro.
Aro looked at Benxu in the distance. "He said that Zhiming is his friend!
Knowing Destiny is his friend, so no one can make trouble for her! "
Benxu was silent.
Aro continued. "He also said that he won't kill you this time. He asked you to go back and tell Da Yuan that if Zhiming doesn't want to go back, Da Yuan shouldn't force her to go back!"
Benxu glanced at Ye Zhiming not far away and turned to leave.
He knew that with these two women around, he couldn't take Ye Zhiming away.
After Benxu left, Ye Zhiming looked at Aro and Thirty. "Did he ask you to protect me in secret?"
Aro nodded.
Ye Zhiming was silent. No one knew what he was thinking.
....
Somewhere in the distant starry sky, two sword lights streaked across the starry sky like meteors, bright and dazzling.
About half an hour later, Senior Sister Lu suddenly stopped. She looked into the distance and said softly, "There's a Sword Sect relic in front!"
Ye Xuan looked into the distance and said softly, "I hope she buried the box …"
Senior Sister Lu: "…"

Chapter 1332
In front of Ye Xuan and Senior Sister Lu was an endless mountain range, and in the depths of the mountain range, several palaces could be vaguely seen.
At this moment, Ye Xuan also sensed the sword intent!
And it was a very strong sword intent!
Ye Xuan asked softly, "Senior Sister Lu, what is this Sword Sect?"
Senior Sister Lu answered softly, "It was founded by one of his Senior Brothers. Let's go and have a look!"
Ye Xuan nodded.
Soon, they came to a mountain gate. The gate was several meters wide, and there were two big black words on the gate: Sword Sect.
The words were bold and powerful, as if they were carved by a sharp sword.
Behind the gate was a Xiao Dao with endless stone steps.
Ye Xuan and Senior Sister Lu slowly walked up the stone steps to the Xiao Dao. The Xiao Dao was deserted, and the weeds on both sides were several meters high. Obviously, no one had been here for a long time.
Ye Xuan asked softly, "Why is it so deserted?"
Senior Sister Lu looked around, and her eyes flickered, "They should be dead!"
Ye Xuan was silent.
There were no traces of fighting here, which meant that the people here were either dead or had left!
Soon, the two of them arrived before a large hall.
In front of the palace was a huge stone statue of the green-robed man, and on his shoulder was the little white guy.
Ye Xuan quickly called Xiao Ling'er out. Xiao Ling'er sniffed and walked to the statue of the green-robed man. She lightly stamped the ground with her little feet, and after a while, she turned to look at Ye Xuan and shook her head.
Ye Xuan asked softly, "No?"
Senior Sister Lu suddenly said, "Maybe he has never been here!"
Looking at the disappointed Xiao Ling'er, Ye Xuan smiled, "It's okay, we will definitely meet him in the future!"
Xiao Ling'er quickly nodded.
Ye Xuan looked at Senior Sister Lu. "Let's go!"
Senior Sister Lu nodded slightly, and the two of them were about to leave. However, at this moment, the sound of a sword suddenly rang out from the hall behind them.
Both of them stopped.
Ye Xuan turned around and a voice suddenly rang out in the hall. "A familiar aura … Sect Master?"
His voice was trembling, and it was obvious that he was very excited.
Sect Leader?
Ye Xuan looked at Senior Sister Lu, who said softly, "Let's go in and take a look!"
Ye Xuan nodded.
The two of them walked into the great hall. In the great hall, a sword floated in the air, and the voice came from the sword.
When the two of them walked into the main hall, the voice sounded again. "You are not the Sect Leader!"
Ye Xuan sized up the sword and said, "You are?"
The man suddenly said, "Your bloodline …"
At this time, Senior Sister Lu suddenly asked, "Who are you?"
The sword trembled and turned into a middle-aged man.
Senior Sister Lu looked at the middle-aged man, "I don't know you!"
She basically knew all the people around him. Of course, except for some women.
The middle-aged man glanced at Senior Sister Lu and said, "I'm the Sect Leader of this Sword Sect!"
Senior Sister Lu said, "Who's the Founding Ancestor of your Sword Sect?"
When she spoke up to this point, she seemed to have thought of something and said, "I mean the one who founded this Sword Sect!"
The middle-aged man spoke in a low voice, "You mean the Founding Ancestor Tingyun!"
"Tingyun!"
Senior Sister Lu was slightly stunned, and then she said softly, "So it's her!"
Ye Xuan looked at Senior Sister Lu, "You know her?"
Senior Sister Lu nodded, "She's the strongest in the Sword Dao besides him in the Sword Sect, and her talent is the highest as well!"
As she spoke, she looked at the middle-aged man, "Why has this Sword Sect become like this?"
The middle-aged man smiled bitterly, "We've encountered a calamity!"
Senior Sister Lu frowned slightly, "Calamity?"
The middle-aged man nodded, "In the past, our Sword Sect had a sacred artifact called Sword Scripture.
It was left behind by the Founding Ancestor. But since Founding Ancestor Tingyun left, the Daoting coveted it. In the end … "
Senior Sister Lu's eyes narrowed slightly, "The Daoting seized the Sword Scripture?"
The middle-aged man nodded, "The Daoting didn't dare to touch it when Founding Ancestor Tingyun was here. But after Founding Ancestor Tingyun left, the Daoting immediately sent someone to seize the Sword Scripture …"
Senior Sister Lu's expression was cold, "They actually dared to seize the Sword Scripture!
How audacious of them! "
The middle-aged man sighed in a low voice, "We're useless!
If Founding Ancestor Tingyun was here … "
Senior Sister Lu looked at the middle-aged man, "Where's Tingyun?"
The middle-aged man said in a low voice, "Founding Ancestor Tingyun left!
As for where he went, I don't know. "
Senior Sister Lu said softly, "That little girl should have gone to find him!"
Little girl!
The middle-aged man's expression became slightly strange, "You are?"
Ye Xuan quickly said, "She's Senior Sister Lu, also from the Sword Sect!"
The middle-aged man was a little surprised, "You're also from the Sword Sect?"
Senior Sister Lu nodded.
The middle-aged man cupped his fist, "Oh, you're from the same sect!"
Senior Sister Lu pointed at the green-robed man's statue outside the hall, "Has he been here before?"
The middle-aged man said, "Yes, he seemed to have come to see Founding Ancestor Tingyun!"
Senior Sister Lu asked again, "Did he leave anything behind?"
The middle-aged man thought for a while and then shook his head, "I don't think so!"
Senior Sister Lu was silent.
Ye Xuan smiled, "Since he didn't leave anything behind, then forget it!"
At this time, the middle-aged man suddenly said, "But, a little white guy did leave a box behind!"
A box!
Ye Xuan and Senior Sister Lu were stunned.
There's a box!
Senior Sister Lu said in a low voice, "Where is it?"
The middle-aged man turned around and pointed at the table in front of him, and there was a small box on the table.
The middle-aged man said, "Tingyun said that this box was a gift from that little white guy, and he asked us to keep it well. Then, our Sword Sect put it up for worship!"
Ye Xuan and Senior Sister Lu were speechless.
They even put it up for worship!
Ye Xuan hesitated for a moment, and then said, "Didn't you open this box during the Sword Sect's calamity?"
The middle-aged man shook his head, "No!"
As he spoke, he looked at the box, "Is there something special about this box?"
Ye Xuan and Senior Sister Lu exchanged glances, and both were speechless.
Senior Sister Lu suddenly said, "Daoting, if you open this box when someone comes, then you might have a chance to survive!"
The middle-aged man was astonished, "This … How is this possible?
As far as I know, that little white guy isn't very strong. "
Senior Sister Lu shook her head, "She isn't very good at fighting, but she can call for help."
Call for help!
Who has the most backing?
It's definitely Little White!
A very, very long time ago, no one dared to offend this little white guy, because offending her was equivalent to poking a hornet's nest.
The middle-aged man glanced at the box and smiled bitterly, "No wonder Ancestor Tingyun asked us to keep it well all those years ago!
But none of us took it seriously! "
Ye Xuan hesitated for a moment, and then said, "Can you give this box to me?"
Senior Sister Lu rolled her eyes at Ye Xuan. This guy's face is really thick, and he's asking for it directly!
The middle-aged man smiled, "Of course!
This thing is useless in our Sword Sect.
Moreover, you are his … "
Senior Sister Lu suddenly changed the topic, "Just a box?"
The middle-aged man nodded, "Just a box!"
Senior Sister Lu looked at Ye Xuan, "Then take it away!"
Ye Xuan nodded slightly, and then he looked at the middle-aged man, "You only have a strand of your soul left. Do you want to continue living in this world, or do you want me to send you into reincarnation?"
The middle-aged man smiled bitterly, "Just let me perish in this world!"
Ye Xuan shook his head, "Then allow me to send you into reincarnation!"
As soon as he finished speaking, he opened his palm, and the Divine Seal of Samsara appeared. It didn't take long for a Path of Samsara to appear in front of him.
The middle-aged man's eyes were filled with astonishment when he witnessed this scene, "You're actually a guardian of the Grand Dao!"
Ye Xuan nodded, "I obtained this Divine Seal by chance. As for the guardian of the Grand Dao, I can barely be considered as one!"
The middle-aged man took a deep and long glance at Ye Xuan, and then he said, "Take care of yourself!"
As soon as he finished speaking, he entered the Path of Samsara, and it didn't take long for it to close.
Ye Xuan walked over to the box, and then he sized it up and spoke softly, "It's that little fellow inside, right?"
Senior Sister Lu shook her head, "I don't know!"
Meanwhile, Xiao Ling 'er took the box in her arms.
Ye Xuan smiled, "Xiao Ling 'er, can you sense what's inside?"
Xiao Ling 'er blinked, and then she gazed at the box. A short moment later, she grinned, "I'm not telling you!"
As soon as she finished speaking, she took the box into the Pagoda.
Ye Xuan shook his head and smiled.
Senior Sister Lu spoke in a low voice, "How do you intend to use this box?"
Ye Xuan smiled, "It's an extraordinary gift I'm leaving for the Daoting!"
As soon as he finished speaking, he glanced at the surroundings and spoke softly, "Fortunately, we didn't return empty-handed. Let's go!"
Senior Sister Lu nodded.
The two of them left. However, they'd just left the hall when Ye Xuan's expression suddenly changed drastically. He grabbed Senior Sister Lu's shoulder and sent her into the Pagoda.
Meanwhile, the sky suddenly split apart, and then a spear that carried a strand of blood red flames stabbed down from the sky.
Before this spear even landed, the entire Sword Sect was burned to ashes by a wave of flames.
A cold smile curved the corners of Ye Xuan's mouth. He opened his palm and a sword soared into the sky.
Bang!
The sky suddenly split apart and turned into a giant black hole!
At the same time, a man appeared in the sky.
The man was over seven feet tall and had a burly physique. He wore a golden-purple beast robe, and his eyes were as sharp as swords.
In his hand was a long halberd. The halberd was twelve feet long, and its shaft seemed to be forged from magma. The tip of the halberd seemed to contain the power of an Asura, and it exuded a terrifying malevolent and murderous aura that could confuse one's mind and cause one to feel a thirst for blood.
He stood in the sky, and at this moment, the entire world seemed so tiny in front of him!
Ye Xuan looked at the man, "Daoting!"
In the sky, the man looked down at Ye Xuan, "I am Xuan Yong, one of the Four Divine Generals of Daoting. Today, I have come to take your head."
Ye Xuan's eyes narrowed, "You've made a move on Sister Nian!"
He knew that if these people wanted to deal with him, they would definitely stall Mu Niannian.
In the Fifth Dimension.
In the starry sky, an old man stood in front of Mu Niannian. It was Bai Dizi.
Mu Niannian looked at Bai Dizi and smiled, "I thought you would have to wait until the Fifth Dimension Tribulation!"
Bai Dizi smiled, "Miss, how about this. We'll let Young Master Ye and Xuan Yong fight one on one. I, Daoting, won't interfere, and you won't interfere either. What do you think?"
Mu Niannian was silent.
In the deepest part of the starry sky, a super array had enveloped the entire Fifth Dimension.
If she went to save Ye Xuan, this array and Daoting expert would destroy the Fifth Dimension!
Mu Niannian turned her head to look at the Fifth Dimension and smiled, "As expected of Daoting, to be able to find my weakness so quickly. You all know that every time I make a move, the Fifth Dimension Tribulation will arrive faster!
And now, you all want to force me to make a move so that the Fifth Dimension Tribulation will arrive earlier! "
Bai Dizi looked at Mu Niannian, "It's not easy for Miss to cultivate to this point!
Do you really want to sacrifice yourself for a human? "
Mu Niannian smiled, "He called me Sister!
As an elder sister, isn't protecting her younger brother a matter of course? "
.....









Chapter 1333
Sister!
As soon as Mu Niannian said this, she shook her head and smiled.
She suddenly realized that she had unknowingly acknowledged Ye Xuan in her heart. It was not the same kind of acknowledgment as before. This kind of acknowledgment was as if she was treating him as family!
But this feeling was not bad!
At this moment, she suddenly understood the plain-dressed woman.
In the past, she did not understand why the plain-dressed woman cared so much about Ye Xuan. For an expert at her level, familial love and whatnot should be very, very indifferent!
But at this moment, she realized that no matter how strong a person was, they were afraid of loneliness, afraid of not having someone they cared about.
Loneliness was the greatest enemy of the strong!
And the feeling of having someone they cared about was actually not bad.
Familial love!
For some people, this was a very meaningless thing, but for others, it was more important than life.
She, Mu Niannian, had guarded this part of the universe for many years. All these years, she was like an observer, an observer of the Five-Dimensional Universe. She silently guarded and observed.
But no one walked into her world.
She did not hate people, but she did not like them either.
Because people were really complicated, and they could change themselves very willfully.
Good today, bad tomorrow.
However, she also felt that humans were very interesting, just like familial love, friendship, and love.
She had to admit that being with Ye Xuan made her a lot happier.
In the starry sky, Bai Dizi looked at Mu Niannian. "It seems that Miss is determined to interfere in this matter!"
As he said this, he shook his head. "Miss, you are injured, but you still want to meddle in other people's business. It is really not wise!"
Mu Niannian collected her thoughts and said with a smile, "Let's wait and see!"
After saying this, she looked at the distant end of the starry sky.
Bai Dizi did not speak again, but looked in the direction of Ye Xuan and Xuan Yong.
...
Below, Ye Xuan's face was gloomy. He knew that Daoting dared to make a move because he must have stalled Sister Nian!
At this moment, he was a little worried!
Even though Sister Nian was powerful, she was still injured!
He had to rush back!
Ye Xuan looked up at Xuan Yong in the sky. If he wanted to rush back, he had to first deal with this person!
Divine General!
One of the Four Great Divine Generals of Daoting!
In the sky, Xuan Yong quietly held the halberd in his hand. A powerful pressure swept down from the sky, as if the sky was collapsing.
Force!
Oppressing others with force!
This aura contained a domineering intent that looked down on the world, making it hard for one to breathe.
Down below, Ye Xuan revealed a savage smile. "Bring it on!"
As soon as he finished speaking, he turned into a beam of sword light and soared into the sky.
Chi!
This sword directly broke through that powerful pressure!
In the sky, Xuan Yong's face was expressionless as he stabbed down with his halberd. The tip of the halberd was covered in flames that contained a monstrous spear aura!
This halberd seemed like it was going to pierce through the heavens and earth!
Ye Xuan's sword arrived.
A tit for tat!
Boom!
A wave of sword light suddenly shattered!
This spear directly suppressed Ye Xuan's sword force. However, Ye Xuan did not retreat. Instead, he advanced. Holding the sword with both hands, the sword slid along the halberd and slashed towards Xuan Yong's face.
Xuan Yong's reaction was extremely fast. The moment Ye Xuan's sword changed direction, he swept the halberd in his hand. This sweep directly hit Ye Xuan's sword!
Boom!
Ye Xuan retreated several thousand feet in an instant. The moment he stopped, a cold gleam arrived.
Chi!
Before the halberd arrived, the cold gleam arrived first, followed by the force!
Ye Xuan's right foot slammed down.
(This chapter is not over. Please continue to the next page.)
He stomped on the starry sky, borrowing the power of the Dao of Space to forcefully stop himself. At this moment, Xuan Yong's halberd arrived!
Ye Xuan didn't choose to block it. If he did, he would lose momentum. The person in front of him was extremely good at gaining momentum. If he lost momentum, he would be at a complete disadvantage.
Ye Xuan didn't dodge or evade. He directly used his sword domain, which instantly weakened the sword aura. At this moment, Ye Xuan's sword slashed down.
Boom!
The halberd was forced to a stop!
And at this moment, Xuan Yong suddenly vanished from where he was.
In the distance, Ye Xuan's pupils constricted. He suddenly slashed to his right, and this slash directly hit a cold gleam.
Boom!
The sky shook violently, and then it exploded!
And at this moment, afterimages suddenly appeared around Ye Xuan. These afterimages seemed to be solid, and it was impossible to distinguish which was real and which was fake!
At the same time, Ye Xuan retreated explosively. Within the pitch-black spatial black hole, sword lights crisscrossed, and ear-piercing explosions resounded incessantly!
After retreating for about 15 minutes, those afterimages suddenly converged, and the next moment, a halberd stabbed straight at the center of Ye Xuan's brows!
This strike caused the heavens and the earth to tremble!
Ye Xuan still didn't retreat. He held his sword with both hands and slashed forward. At the same time, his Sword Domain suppressed Xuan Yong's halberd once more!
Bang!
Within the Sword Domain, an enormous bang that shook the heavens resounded abruptly, and then Ye Xuan's face instantly turned ghastly pale. However, he'd forcefully blocked this halberd strike. After that, he suddenly grabbed the halberd with his left hand, and then he swiftly stabbed forward with the sword in his right hand.
However, Xuan Yong's reaction was extremely swift. At the instant Ye Xuan's sword stabbed forward, Xuan Yong suddenly let go of the halberd, clenched his right hand into a fist, and then smashed his fist towards Ye Xuan's sword.
Rumble!
Both of them retreated explosively at the same time!
This caused Ye Xuan to retreat by over 300m, and the space he retreated to had collapsed and been obliterated!
In the distance, Xuan Yong had stopped as well, and then he suddenly tossed the halberd in his right hand towards Ye Xuan. At the same time, he suddenly stomped his right foot backwards, and his entire body shot out explosively like a cannonball!
Ye Xuan had just stopped when a halberd tore through the sky towards him, and it was Xuan Yong who was following behind it!
A wisp of ferocity flashed through Ye Xuan's eyes as he stabbed with his sword. This time, it was a strike to decide life and death with a single strike!
It was a sword technique that the woman in a simple dress had taught him!
A single strike of the sword to decide life and death. Actually, it was more appropriate to say that he could decide life and death with a single strike of the sword!
Because he didn't possess the invincible strength that the woman in a simple dress possessed, so it was impossible for him to decide the life and death of anyone with a single strike of the sword!
Once this strike of the sword was executed, only one of them would die!
This was his current state of mind!
A single strike.
A sword howl resounded through the starry sky like a thunderclap!
Bang!
As soon as the halberd came into contact with Ye Xuan's sword, both sword and halberd trembled violently, and then the halberd was blasted flying.
This strike of the sword had destroyed the halberd. However, Xuan Yong had already appeared in front of Ye Xuan, and he smashed his fist towards Ye Xuan's chest. His fist was extremely overbearing, and it wasn't the slightest bit weaker than the halberd.
Dual cultivation of the fist and halberd!
Ye Xuan didn't dodge when facing Xuan Yong's fist, and he allowed Xuan Yong's fist to smash against his chest. However, he'd smashed his fist against Xuan Yong's chest as well!
Of course, this wasn't an ordinary punch, but a Daoist scripture martial technique, Courting Death!
Their fists had just arrived before each other ….
Rumble!
The mountains for tens of thousands of miles around them were suddenly razed to the ground, and the two of them were blasted back. They flew for tens of thousands of feet, and the entire sky and earth was a mess!
After Ye Xuan stopped, he spat out a mouthful of blood, and his body cracked inch by inch. Fortunately, he had the Indestructible Body of 10,000 Buddhas, so his body wasn't completely destroyed. However, it was still miserable, and his body was covered in cracks, revealing his white bones.
In the distance, Xuan Yong wasn't having a good time either. He'd taken the brunt of Ye Xuan's attack!
(This chapter is not over, please turn the page.)
After using the Daoist scripture martial technique, he'd instantly retreated thousands of feet away. His battle robe had also turned to ash, and his body was covered in several cracks. His body was dyed red with blood, and he looked like a man made of blood!
Both of them were in a miserable state!
Xuan Yong looked at the distant Ye Xuan, and his expression was incomparably solemn. He hadn't expected that the human in front of him would fight him to this extent!
It had to be known that Ye Xuan was only at the Self Release Realm, and hadn't reached the Dao Corroboration Realm!
In next to no time, he suddenly noticed a problem!
It was that he'd suffered a great loss by trading injury for injury just now!
Because he'd been suppressing Ye Xuan earlier, and it was only just now that he'd chosen to trade injury for injury that caused both sides to be injured!
The reason he'd chosen to trade injury for injury was because he didn't think that Ye Xuan would be able to take a punch from him head-on. Of course, he hadn't expected that Ye Xuan would possess such a formidable martial technique!
Even though he'd resisted that martial technique just now, he'd been heavily injured!
Xuan Yong took a deep breath. Right at this moment, Ye Xuan suddenly said, "I've more or less recovered!"
Xuan Yong looked at Ye Xuan, and he was stunned when he saw Ye Xuan. Because at this moment, Ye Xuan's injuries had mostly recovered.
Xuan Yong stared fixedly at Ye Xuan. "How could this be possible!?"
Ye Xuan naturally hadn't told Xuan Yong that his body possessed the ability to heal. A God Seal suddenly appeared between his brows, and then he vanished on the spot in the next moment!
A single strike to decide life and death!
After he attained the Dao Corroboration Realm, the might of Ye Xuan's attack had instantly risen explosively, and it was at least a few times stronger than before!
A ferocious expression flashed through Xuan Yong's eyes. He gestured with his right hand, and the halberd appeared in his grasp. In the next moment, he leaped up and stabbed with the halberd.
Flames incinerated the sky on the halberd!
Hiss!
A sharp and ear piercing sound of something being torn apart resounded abruptly.
Bang!
Suddenly, an expanse of flames and the glow of a sword erupted. In an instant, both of them retreated explosively. During this process, Ye Xuan suddenly opened his palm, and then his sword flew forward and slashed through the surroundings.
Xuan Yong's reaction was extremely swift. At the instant that Ye Xuan attacked, the halberd in his hand had suddenly flown forward, and it tore through the air and tore through everything.
The halberd and sword collided once more.
Bang!
The glow of the sword and flames suddenly erupted!
The entire heavens and the earth trembled!
As soon as Ye Xuan stopped moving, he opened his palm, and the Soul Suppressing Sword appeared in his grasp. He pointed it at Xuan Yong from afar, "Soul Suppression with a Single Strike!"
Om!
A sword howl suddenly shook the heavens and the earth, and then an extremely powerful strand of the soul suddenly locked onto Xuan Yong. Meanwhile, Xuan Yong suddenly roared furiously, "Disperse!"
As soon as he finished speaking, a powerful sound wave swept out from within him, and it was accompanied by a powerful aura of evil and slaughter.
Rumble!
This energy had actually forcefully obstructed the energy of the Soul Suppressing Sword!
Ye Xuan's attack hadn't been able to successfully suppress Xuan Yong's soul!
Xuan Yong had experienced countless battles, and his soul was extraordinarily strong. So, unless the Soul Suppressing Sword was stabbed into his body, otherwise, it was practically impossible to suppress his soul from afar!
At this moment, Ye Xuan suddenly vanished on the spot. A strand of sword light tore through the battlefield. The three sword lights contained three powerful Domains.
A single strike to decide life and death plus three Domains!
Ye Xuan's strongest attack!
A wisp of a ferocious smile arose on the corners of Xuan Yong's mouth. He suddenly stomped his right foot on the ground, and space collapsed while his figure shot forward explosively. A strand of flames instantly swept through the sky from the halberd in his hand, and it was like heavenly flames could destroy the world.
A Halberd of Life and Death!
Only one of them would die beneath this halberd strike!
Daoting Divine Generals had never been afraid of death!

Chapter 1334
In the sky, both Ye Xuan and Divine General Xuan Yong executed their strongest attacks!
It didn't take long for Ye Xuan's sword to collide with Divine General Xuan Yong's halberd. In an instant …
Bang!
In an instant, the space in a radius of hundreds of thousands of kilometers was reduced to ashes. Countless rays of sword light and flaming halberd energy shot out from the pitch-black space, and it was a complete mess.
As for Ye Xuan and Xuan Yong, they both retreated explosively for tens of thousands of meters!
After Ye Xuan stopped, his body slowly fell from the sky while blood gushed out incessantly from his mouth. His injuries were extremely severe, and his entire body was covered in cracks. He was like porcelain that had suffered a heavy blow and would shatter at any moment.
At this moment, he couldn't feel his own body anymore!
In the distance, Xuan Yong was also slowly falling from the sky. His injuries were extremely severe as well, and his body was covered in dense sword energy. Especially his right hand, it had almost been chopped off by Ye Xuan's sword. However, the halberd by his side still emitted a powerful halberd intent.
The halberd soul was inextinguishable, and its battle intent surged!
Suddenly, the halberd transformed into a black ray of light that shot out and slashed towards Ye Xuan in the distance.
An autonomous attack!
Meanwhile, a sword suddenly flew out from within Ye Xuan's body.
It was the Soul Suppressing Sword!
The Soul Suppressing Sword transformed into a black ray of sword light that slashed towards the halberd!
It didn't take long for the sword and halberd to fight in midair!
Meanwhile, Ye Xuan and Xuan Yong had already landed on the ground.
Bang!
Ye Xuan's body trembled slightly, and he spat out another mouthful of blood. He took a deep breath, placed his hands on the ground, and slowly exerted force in an attempt to stand up. However, he realized that it was extremely difficult!
Because he could barely feel his own body anymore!
But he knew that he had to stand up!
Ye Xuan took another deep breath, roared furiously, and suddenly exerted force with his right hand.
Crack!
The sound of bones breaking suddenly resounded from this exertion!
His right hand was directly fractured!
Because his entire body had been smashed into pieces just now, that was why a light exertion of force was able to fracture his arm!
Although his arm was fractured, he still stood up.
In the distance, Xuan Yong had also stood up and was slowly walking towards him!
Ye Xuan grinned and then slowly walked towards Xuan Yong. Both of them walked very slowly, but the desire to fight in their eyes was unprecedentedly strong!
Meanwhile, Ye Xuan's sword and Xuan Yong's halberd were still locked in a fierce battle in the sky. The battle between the halberd and sword was like a raging fire, incomparably intense!
In the Five-Dimensional Universe.
In the starry sky, Mu Niannian suddenly laughed and said, "As expected of the Daoting Immortal General. You have been through hundreds of battles. Even though your body is broken, your will is still strong. In your eyes, there is only battle and death!"
Bai Dizi smiled faintly, "I have to say, this Young master Ye has shocked this old one!
At such a young age, you're not only powerful, but you're also as ferocious as a Daoting Divine General!
If he joins my Daoting, I'm afraid he'll be able to threaten the White-robed Divine General's position in the future! "
Mu Niannian looked at Bai Dizi and said with a smile, "White-robed Divine General?"
Bai Dizi said with a smile, "I am the strongest Divine General of Daoting. I have fought in the Dao Tomb all my life and have only lost once."
At this point, he looked at Mu Niannian, "After learning that you killed Heng Tianwu in the underworld, he wanted to meet you. Unfortunately, he has a mission to guard the Heaven Abyss. What a pity!"
Mu Niannian laughed.
Bai Dizi was a little curious, "What are you laughing at, Miss?"
Mu Niannian said with a smile, "My little brother has a sister called Qing'er … En …"
At this point, she suddenly became excited, "In that case, it seems like she's going to call me sister!"
At this point, she seemed to have thought of something and quickly shook her head, "No, no, this woman is unreasonable. I can't take advantage of her, or I'll be beaten!"
At this time, Bai Dizi suddenly said, "Qing'er?
Is she the woman in a plain dress behind Ye Xuan? "
Mu Niannian looked at Bai Dizi and said with a smile, "It seems like you've investigated very clearly!
You even investigated her! "
Bai Dizi shook his head and smiled, "We've always been very serious when facing our enemies!"
Mu Niannian said with a smile, "As expected of a force that could exist for so long!
By the way, how much do you know about this Qing'er? "
Bai Dizi shook his head, "I only know that she only uses one sword to kill!"
Mu Niannian blinked, "What else?"
Bai Dizi looked at Mu Niannian and said with a smile, "What do you want to say, Miss?"
Mu Niannian said with a straight face, "She's very powerful, really!
Most importantly, this woman's way of thinking is very dangerous, as if she wants to destroy the universe at the slightest provocation, it's really a little scary! "
Bai Dizi said with a smile, "Miss, she only needs one sword to kill in this lower realm, it's not difficult to say anything!"
Mu Niannian was a little curious, "Why do you say that?"
Bai Dizi said with a smile, "Maybe it's not that she's too strong, but that the people of this world are too weak?"
Mu Niannian blinked, then laughed, "Actually … what you said makes a lot of sense!"
Bai Dizi looked at Mu Niannian and didn't say anything.
Mu Niannian also didn't say anything. She turned her head and looked in the distance, Ye Xuan and Divine General Xuan Yong were only about ten zhang apart.
Ye Xuan didn't say anything, his left hand slowly clenched, but at this time, he couldn't mobilize any strength, and opposite him, Xuan Yong was the same.
At this time, Ye Xuan and Xuan Yong suddenly charged at each other!
Both of them seemed like they were fighting one last attack before death!
Xuan Yong's fist smashed against Ye Xuan's chest, and Ye Xuan's fist smashed against Xuan Yong's chest as well.
Bang!
Bang! Both of them were instantly blasted flying, and then they smashed heavily against the ground. This time, their bodies twitched while blood sprayed!
Their injuries were very, very serious!
Meanwhile, Ye Xuan suddenly roared furiously, and then he forced himself to stand up. He opened his palm, and a sword appeared in it.
Executing Heaven Sword!
Ye Xuan looked at Xuan Yong and grinned, "I have two swords!"
As soon as he finished speaking, the Executing Heaven Sword in his hand suddenly flew out. However, it wasn't able to kill Xuan Yong because a beast soul had suddenly appeared in front of Xuan Yong, and the beast soul suddenly roared furiously and forcefully blocked the Executing Heaven Sword!
Meanwhile, another sword appeared in Ye Xuan's hand!
The Sword Spirit!
Xuan Yong's expression instantly changed when he saw the Sword Spirit!
But right at this moment, a middle-aged man suddenly appeared on the scene. The middle-aged man wore black armor and held a long saber in his hand. His gaze descended onto Ye Xuan, and in the next moment, he raised his saber and charged towards Ye Xuan!
In the Fifth Dimension. Mu Niannian smiled silently and didn't say anything.
Bai Dizi wasn't too far away from her as he gazed into the distance, and no one knew what he was thinking.
Right when the middle aged man arrived in front of Ye Xuan, Xuan Yong suddenly said, "Stop!"
The middle aged man stopped and gazed at Xuan Yong. Xuan Yong slowly closed his eyes. "I'm fighting him fairly. Why are you interfering?"
The middle aged man hesitated for a moment before he said, "Divine General, the objective of our trip is …."
"Shut up!"
Xuan Yong suddenly gazed at the middle aged man. "Stand down!"
The middle aged man didn't dare refute him and immediately retreated to the side.
Xuan Yong looked at Ye Xuan. "You have a Swordsman woman in your body. Why didn't you let her out just now?"
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "You and I are having a fair battle. Why would you want an outsider to interfere?"
Xuan Yong looked deeply at Ye Xuan. "What a fair fight. Although you are my opponent, you are still an upright person. Next time, we will fight to the death!"
Finish
Then, he turned around and left.
The middle-aged man hesitated for a moment, wanting to say something but hesitating.
In the distance, Xuan Yong suddenly said, "I'll take full responsibility!"
The middle-aged man sighed softly, then turned around and left.
He could actually sense Ye Xuan's weakness. It could be said that he could kill Ye Xuan effortlessly now.
However, he did not dare to reject Xuan Yong's order!
After Xuan Yong left, Ye Xuan slowly closed his eyes. It had to be said that Divine General Xuan Yong was indeed very strong, be it in terms of battle awareness or ruthlessness.
This time, if his physical body was not strong enough, he would definitely not be able to defeat the other party!
This was because the other party was a fist and halberd cultivator. Moreover, if the Soul Suppressing Sword was not strong enough, it would not work because the halberd in Xuan Yong's hand was at least at the Dao Confirming realm!
The battle just now was not only a battle between him and Xuan Yong, but also the Soul Suppressing Sword and that long sword!
Of course, he still had a trump card that he had not taken out, and that was the Qiankun gourd and the power of his bloodline!
However, he was also very clear that if he had a trump card, others would definitely have a trump card too. The other party was experienced in hundreds of battles, so it was impossible that he did not have a trump card!
Ye Xuan withdrew his thoughts and looked at Senior Sister Lu. "Let's go back!"
With that, he turned around and was about to leave, but he suddenly realized that his injuries were very serious.
Ye Xuan shook his head and smiled bitterly. Then, he sat down cross-legged and began to heal!
In the Five-Dimensional Universe.
Bai Dizi looked at Mu Niannian. "This lady is very confident in Young Master Ye!"
From the beginning until now, he realized that the woman in front of him had not shown any signs of making a move. There was only one explanation, and that was that she had confidence in Ye Xuan!
Mu Niannian smiled. "Your Divine General has the demeanor of an expert. If he meets me next time, I promise to leave his corpse intact, haha …"
With that, she turned around and left.
In the field, Bai Dizi was silent.
This time, he had originally wanted to force Mu Niannian to make a move, but he had not expected that Ye Xuan would be evenly matched with Divine General Xuan Yong!
And that Ye Xuan was only in his early twenties!
Not only was he young, but his strength was also so heaven-defying. Most importantly, he had a ruthless spirit in his bones.
Bai Dizi was silent for a long time before he turned around and left.
At this moment, he had already made up his mind. This Ye Xuan could not be allowed to live, especially not to allow Ye Xuan to rely on the Dao Tomb!
Ye Xuan must die!
It could be said that this was a Daoting attitude!
...
Ye Xuan, who was recuperating, suddenly raised his head. He did not know when Mu Niannian had appeared in front of him.
Seeing Mu Niannian, Ye Xuan immediately breathed a sigh of relief. "Sister Nian, has Daoting already made a move?"
Mu Niannian smiled. "Yes!"
Ye Xuan was about to speak when Mu Niannian said, "Focus on recuperating!"
Ye Xuan nodded.
Four hours later, Ye Xuan's injuries were eighty to ninety percent healed. Beside him, Mu Niannian smiled. "How did that battle feel?"
Ye Xuan said with a smile, "That felt great!"
Mu Niannian looked at Ye Xuan. "Daoting has someone dozens of times stronger than the one just now!"
Ye Xuan was speechless.
Mu Niannian smiled. "Scared?"
Ye Xuan nodded. "A little."
Mu Niannian laughed. She lightly patted Ye Xuan's shoulder. "Useless!
A real man lives in this world with his head holding up the sky and his feet stepping on the ground fearlessly.
You're actually afraid. Useless! "
Ye Xuan suddenly asked, "Sister Nian, are you afraid of Qing 'er?"
Mu Niannian's expression froze. After a moment, she looked up at the sky. "Tonight's moon is not bad … Mm, the wind is gentle … Hmm, my hands are a little itchy …"
Ye Xuan was speechless.
...









Chapter 1335
Looking at the wounded Ye Xuan, Mu Niannian didn't do it. She just rolled her eyes at Ye Xuan.
Ye Xuan chuckled. "Sister Nian, actually, Qing 'er is a good person!"
Mu Niannian shook her head. "Idiot, that's for you!"
Then, she smiled. "The scariest thing about her is her indifference to life. In her eyes, there's only the difference between the living and the dead."
Ye Xuan was silent.
Indeed, Qing 'er was sometimes too cold.
As if thinking of something, Ye Xuan asked, "Sister Nian, how bad is Qing 'er?"
Mu Niannian was silent.
Ye Xuan asked, "Even you don't know?"
Mu Niannian chuckled and said, "I can roughly guess, but I can't tell you!"
Ye Xuan was puzzled. "Why?"
Mu Niannian blinked. "Because I don't want to hurt you!"
Ye Xuan was speechless.
Mu Niannian smiled. "Come, follow me. It's time for you to understand something!"
Then, she turned and left.
Ye Xuan hurried to follow her.
In the underworld.
Bai Dizi appeared at the intersection of the underworld and the living world. As soon as he appeared, Mu Sheng appeared in front of him.
Bai Dizi smiled. "Miss Mu Sheng, are you willing to go Daoting with us?"
Mu Sheng narrowed her eyes. "Bai Di Xing, do you know my duty?"
Bai Dizi nodded. "I do!
Miss Mu Sheng has guarded this world for so many years. You've done a great service! "
Mu Sheng said in a low voice. "You don't want the boundary between the underworld and the living world!"
Bai Dizi nodded.
Mu Sheng was silent for a moment. "Bai Di Xing, I can leave this place. But I don't want to go Daoting for now. I want to look around!"
White Emperor Star Lord fell silent.
Mu Sheng continued, "White Emperor Star Sovereign, I don't have any other intentions. I just want to look around, that's all!"
Bai Dizi glanced at Mu Sheng and said softly, "The door of Daoting will always be open for you!"
As soon as he finished speaking, he opened his palm, and there was a thick ancient book in his hand. He flipped it open and found Mu Sheng's name. After that, he swiped it lightly, and Mu Sheng's name vanished from the book!
In an instant, something seemed to disappear from Mu Sheng's body!
Bai Dizi looked at Mu Sheng and said, "I have now removed Miss from the priesthood. Miss is now free. Miss can go anywhere in this vast world. However, the Daoting does not want Miss to become the Daoting's enemy in the future!"
Mu Sheng took a deep breath and said, "Don't worry, White Emperor Starlord. Even if I don't return to the Daoting, I won't become an enemy of the Daoting. I'm the Protector of the Grand Dao, and that will never change!"
Bai Dizi nodded, "Miss, take care!"
With that, he turned around and left.
In the same place, Mu Sheng looked around with a complicated expression.
At this time, Man Zhu and Sha Hua appeared beside her.
Man Zhu said softly, "You can go to the Daoting!"
Mu Sheng was expressionless, "The Daoting is no longer the Daoting of the past!
The Three Thousand Grand Daos have become the tools of some people! "
Man Zhu was silent.
Mu Sheng looked at Man Zhu and Sha Hua and said, "Let's go!"
Man Zhu and Sha Hua nodded, and soon, the three women disappeared.
With Mu Sheng's departure, there were no longer any obstacles between the Yin Realm and the Yang Realm. They could go from the Yin Realm to the Yang Realm at any time!
..
Bai Dizi arrived at the Yin Realm's lotus platform. On the lotus platform was Nanzang Bodhisattva.
Bai Dizi smiled, "Nanzang Bodhisattva, how have you been!"
Nanzang put his palms together, "White Emperor Starlord, did you come for the Fifth Dimension?"
Bai
The Emperor nodded, "Nanzang, the Daoting needs your help!"
Nanzang shook his head and smiled, "White Emperor Starlord must be joking!"
Bai Dizi said softly, "The majority of my Daoting experts are guarding the Celestial Abyss!"
Nanzang was silent.
Bai Dizi smiled, "I won't help for nothing!"
Nanzang looked at Bai Dizi, "Does Starlord know the strength of that girl?"
Bai Dizi said softly, "This is no longer important!"
Nanzang frowned, "What does this flower mean?"
Bai Dizi looked at Nanzang, "She is provoking the might of the Daoting!"
Provoking!
Nanzang was silent.
At this moment, he understood.
The relationship between the Daoting and Ye Xuan could not be resolved peacefully.
Ye Xuan had the Dao Scripture that the Daoting wanted. Moreover, Ye Xuan had killed the sixth princess of the Daoting. With this, the Daoting would not be able to resolve peacefully with Ye Xuan!
As for Mu Niannian … this woman was already provoking the Daoting!
The Daoting would not allow anyone to provoke their might!
Nanzang was still silent.
He had seen Mu Niannian and knew how powerful that woman was!
He did not want to face that woman!
As if knowing what Nanzang was thinking, Bai Dizi suddenly said, "Don't worry, someone will fight her. We need Nanzang Bodhisattva to help us with something else!"
Nanzang suddenly shook his head, "White Emperor Starlord, go find someone else!
I am already an outsider and do not want to interfere in worldly matters! "
White Emperor Starlord smiled, "Bright Mirror!"
Hearing this, Nanzang's expression changed, "Bright Mirror?"
Bright Mirror was a Buddhist treasure!
White Emperor Starlord nodded.
Nanzang was silent.
A moment later, White Emperor Starlord left the lotus platform and arrived at an entrance to an underground place.
Entrance to Hell!
There were a total of eighteen levels under this entrance!
White Emperor Starlord arrived at the entrance to the eighteenth level, but he did not enter. Looking in front of him, he softly said, "Your Excellency …"
"Scram!"
All of a sudden, an angry roar came from inside.
For a moment, the entire Underworld was shaken, and the eighteen levels of hell were wailing like ghosts and howling like wolves …
After a moment of silence, White Emperor Starlord shook his head, "What a pitiful person!"
After saying this, he turned around and left.
After coming out, White Emperor Starlord saw the Lord of Underworld.
The Lord of Underworld said calmly, "As I said, it is useless!"
White Emperor Starlord nodded, "Fine, if he likes to imprison himself, let him imprison himself!"
The Lord of Underworld asked, "What do you plan to do next?"
White Emperor Starlord said softly, "To deal with that woman, we must deal with the Fifth Dimension. Now that the Underworld and the Yang World are connected, we can make the Fifth Dimension Tribulation of the Fifth Dimension arrive in advance!
If that woman wants to protect the Fifth Dimension, she must fight against the Fifth Dimension Tribulation. At that time, she will be at her weakest. "
After a moment of silence, the Lord of Underworld asked, "How do we make the Fifth Dimension Tribulation of the Fifth Dimension arrive in advance?"
White Emperor Starlord said softly, "Destroy the Origin of the Fifth Dimension!"
The Lord of Underworld said in a deep voice, "Who will deal with that woman!"
In fact, the Fifth Dimension was not scary, and neither was Ye Xuan. Ye Xuan's threat was in the future, while that woman's threat was in the present.
As long as they could deal with Mu Niannian, the Fifth Dimension could be destroyed with a flick of their fingers!
White Emperor Starlord said with a smile, "Lord of Underworld, rest assured. That woman will naturally be dealt with by me, Daoting!"
The Lord of Underworld nodded, "Good!"
White Emperor Starlord turned to look at the depths of the starry sky and said softly, "They should be here soon!"
....
Mu Niannian brought Ye Xuan to a lake. The lake was in the shape of a heart, and the water was clear. At a glance, one could see the blue sky and white clouds.
Ye Xuan looked at Mu Niannian, and Mu Niannian said with a smile, "Heavenly Heart Lake!
I gave it that name! "
Ye Xuan hurriedly said, "It's a good name!
It sounds good! "
Mu Niannian glanced at Ye Xuan and said, "Slippery fellow!"
She pulled Ye Xuan's hand and walked towards the lake. Soon, the two of them reached the bottom of the lake. There were no living creatures at the bottom of the lake, but when they reached the deepest part of the lake, a wave of hot air surged over. This wave of hot air caused Ye Xuan's expression to change!
This was because he was not used to the temperature!
One had to know that his current physical body was extremely powerful.
Mu Niannian continued to pull Ye Xuan down. Soon, the two of them arrived in front of a barrier. The barrier was a hundred zhang wide, and behind it was surging magma!
Ye Xuan looked at Mu Niannian and said, "Sister Nian, this is?"
Mu Niannian smiled and said, "This is the Fifth Dimension Tribulation!"
Fifth Dimension Tribulation!
Ye Xuan was stunned.
Mu Niannian chuckled and said, "Actually, there are many hidden dangers in this universe, but I've suppressed them!
Just like the scene in front of you, I've used my power to suppress the magma. It's not just a little bit of magma, it's the entire underground magma. Once the magma comes out, the power of the magma that has accumulated for tens of thousands of years will destroy everything. Not only that, there are many hidden dangers in this universe!
Simply put, it's very dangerous! "
Ye Xuan was silent.
Mu Niannian smiled and said, "The reason I brought you here is to tell you that the danger of the Fifth Dimension is not limited to the outside world. The Fifth Dimension itself is very dangerous!
The entire Fifth Dimension is full of dangers, and these dangers are not something you can solve with strength alone.
Take me for example. Although I can suppress them for a while, the more I suppress them, the more terrifying they will become in the future. Suppressing them is not a long-term solution. Do you understand what I mean? "
Ye Xuan nodded. "I understand!
We must change the Fifth Dimension. "
Mu Niannian nodded. "We must change it!
Originally, I thought we would have time to slowly change everything, but now it seems we don't have that much time. "
Saying this, she raised her head and looked at the horizon. She smiled and said, "Really, not even a bit of time is given!"
After saying this, she brought Ye Xuan away from the depths of the underground and arrived at the lakeside.
Ye Xuan raised his head and looked at the horizon. He saw an old man. It was Bai Dizi.
Bai Dizi looked at Mu Niannian and faintly smiled. "We meet again!"
Mu Niannian smiled. "You really don't give people a chance to breathe!"
Bai Dizi shook his head. "Miss, if you are willing to pledge allegiance to the Daoting, we can immediately retreat and never harm the Fifth Dimension.
Not only that, the Daoting can take any position other than the Daoting Ancestor! "
It had to be said that this condition was very tempting!
Mu Niannian smiled. "First make me surrender, then control the Fifth Dimension, and finally control me. This is your real plan, isn't it?"
Bai Dizi looked at Mu Niannian and didn't say anything.
Mu Niannian faintly smiled. "I think you must have prepared a big gift for me. Come!"
Bai Dizi softly said, "Then I will have to offend you!"
After saying this, he turned around and waved his right hand. "Battle Path, appear!"
As the sound of his voice faded, a golden light suddenly appeared in the entire sky. Within the golden light was a golden path that was hundreds of feet wide. Within the golden path, a nine-headed Roc suddenly flew out. On the head of the nine-headed Roc stood a man holding a halberd.
At this time, Bai Dizi spread out his right hand and lightly waved it in all directions. In an instant, a golden light covered a radius of tens of thousands of miles.
Bai Dizi faintly smiled. "Battle Path, I will not rest until I die. Miss, are you ready?"
.....
PS: Give me a ticket!









Chapter 1336
Battle Dao!
The so-called Battle Dao referred to the Dao of War. This was a kind of attitude towards Daoting!
Daoting had only been used on the Dao Tomb. Because Battle Dao was connected to Daoting, Daoting experts could come over at any time. But now, Daoting was being used on Mu Niannian!
Clearly, they wanted to kill Mu Niannian this time!
Below, Mu Niannian smiled. Her smile was very calm. "Won't stop until one of us dies?"
Bai Dizi looked at Mu Niannian. "Yes!"
Mu Niannian laughed heartily, "Then come!"
Bai Dizi quietly retreated. In the sky, on the Battle Dao, the man riding the nine-headed rocs suddenly swooped down from the sky.
Boom!
This dive was like several towering mountains crashing down, and a pressure that could destroy the heavens and annihilate the earth swept through the entire land.
At this moment, the entire world trembled. It was as if doomsday had arrived!
Mu Niannian's eyes gradually turned cold. This man's target was not only her, but also the Origin of the Five-Dimensional Universe!
If this man landed, the Origin of this universe would definitely be heavily damaged!
Ye Xuan looked at the man swooping down from the sky with a trace of worry in his eyes. This man was much stronger than Divine General Xuan Yong. Most importantly, the nine-headed rocs were not any weaker than this man.
The power of the nine-headed rocs combined with the man's strength could truly be described as world-destroying!
At this moment, Mu Niannian suddenly looked at Ye Xuan and smiled. "Do you still remember something I said to you before?"
Ye Xuan asked, "What?"
Mu Niannian rolled her eyes at Ye Xuan. "If you don't remember, then forget it!"
With that, she lightly stamped her right foot and soared into the sky.
In the same place, Ye Xuan was dumbfounded.
In the sky, Mu Niannian's petite figure seemed exceptionally tiny compared to the nine-headed Rocs and the man.
However, the Nine-headed Rocs and the man had extremely serious expressions on their faces.
How could they dare to underestimate the woman in front of them?
This was an existence that had insta-killed a Divine General!
The man gripped the Heavenly Halberd tightly in his right hand. He stared at the calm Mu Niannian below. "Daoting Vanguard General Ren Tianxing. Please advise me, Miss!"
As soon as he finished speaking, the nine roc beneath him suddenly raised its head and let out a furious howl, and then its speed increased explosively by a few times!
At this moment, it was as if the world was about to collapse. At the same time, an extremely terrifying pressure directly enveloped Mu Niannian below.
Under this pressure, Mu Niannian was like a small boat in a raging storm, appearing extremely frail.
Right at this moment, Mu Niannian suddenly vanished on the spot. In the next moment, the pressure in the sky vanished without a trace, and then Mu Niannian had suddenly appeared in front of Ren Tianxing.
Ren Tianxing's pupils constricted, and he instinctively swung his halberd. However, Mu Niannian's fist suddenly smashed against his throat.
Crack!
The sound of bones breaking resounded, and then Ren Tianxing's head instantly flew into the air!
Meanwhile, Mu Niannian suddenly descended onto the back of the nine-headed Rocs, and then she lightly stomped her right foot on the ground.
Bang!
The nine-headed Rocs suddenly exploded apart, and blood instantly dyed the entire sky red!
At this moment, everyone was stunned!
Including Ye Xuan!
Another instant kill!
Ye Xuan stared fixedly at Mu Niannian. Exactly how strong is Big Sister Nian?
Bai Dizi was gazing at Mu Niannian as well, and there was a trace of seriousness in his eyes.
Another instant kill!
Actually, he knew that Ren Tianxing couldn't defeat Mu Niannian, and the reason he'd asked Ren Tianxing to fight was because he wanted to see exactly how strong Mu Niannian was!
Unfortunately, he'd still been disappointed!
Mu Niannian had instantly killed Ren Tianxing. Since it was an instant kill, then he naturally didn't know Mu Niannian's approximate strength!
Bai Dizi remained silent, and no one knew what he was thinking.
In the sky, Mu Niannian waved her hand lightly, and then the blood in the sky instantly vanished without a trace. After that, she gazed at Bai Dizi and smiled, "Next!"
Her voice was calm, but it carried a strand of domineering aura!
Bai Dizi gazed at Mu Niannian and spoke softly, "I underestimated you, Young Miss!"
Mu Niannian shook her head and smiled, "All of you've never taken me seriously!"
As she spoke, she looked at Ye Xuan below. "Sister Nian has lived for so many years, and she understands one principle. You must always maintain a low-key and humble heart!
As a person, you can't be complacent, and you can't think that you're above everyone else.
You must know that there's always someone better out there. "
Ye Xuan was silent.
Low-key and humble!
Sister Nian had said this principle more than once. In fact, it might be related to Qing Er!
In the Fifth Dimension, before she'd met Qing Er, Sister Nian should be invincible.
And when she'd met Qing Er, it was probably her low-key and humble attitude that saved her. After all, Qing Er wasn't a kind person.
Being arrogant in front of Qing Er?
That would mean that she was really tired of living!
Of course, Ye Xuan knew that Sister Nian had said this not only for him to hear, but also for the Daoting to hear.
The Daoting had been arrogant from the start, and he'd even tried to recruit Sister Nian. From the Daoting's point of view, they'd recruited Sister Nian because they valued her. But from Sister Nian's point of view, the Daoting's recruitment was looking down on her!
Ye Xuan glanced at Sister Nian. At this moment, he was suddenly in a daze.
Just how strong was Sister Nian?
He really didn't have any confidence!
In the sky, Bai Dizi looked at Mu Niannian and spoke softly, "Young Miss, what you said just now is very reasonable.
But do you really understand this principle? "
Mu Niannian smiled, "You want to say that I've underestimated the Daoting, right?"
Bai Dizi smiled, "You think that we've underestimated you, but we also think that you've underestimated us!"
Mu Niannian laughed heartily, "What you said actually makes sense. Since that's the case, let's continue fighting!
As for who underestimated who, we'll only know after we fight! "
As she spoke, she glanced at the Daoting and smiled, "Why don't I go to the Daoting and fight?"
Go to the Daoting!
Bai Dizi narrowed her eyes and slowly clenched her right hand.
Below, Ye Xuan's eyelids twitched. Was Sister Nian playing with her life?
At this moment, Bai Dizi suddenly smiled, "Young Miss, you don't want the battle to take place in the Fifth Dimension!"
Mu Niannian blinked, "You can say that!"
Bai Dizi shook her head, "I'm sorry, I'm afraid it won't go as you wish!"
Mu Niannian looked at Bai Dizi and did not speak.
At this moment, Guan Yin suddenly appeared beside Ye Xuan and said in a deep voice, "I've just received news that countless Yin Qi has suddenly appeared in the Fifth Dimension. This Yin Qi is corroding the ecological environment of the entire Fifth Dimension.
In addition, the Spiritual Qi of our Fifth Dimension is flowing away at an alarming speed for some unknown reason. "
Hearing this, Ye Xuan raised his head and looked at Bai Dizi, "You're targeting the Fifth Dimension!"
Bai Dizi smiled, then looked at Mu Niannian, "Young Miss, at this speed, the Fifth Dimension Tribulation of the Fifth Dimension will arrive in advance."
Mu Niannian smiled, "I've really underestimated you!
How dare you let the Dao Realm guarding the Yin World and the Yang World leave … How are your actions any different from those of the Dao Breakers? "
Bai Dizi looked at Mu Niannian, "Anything can be changed!"
Mu Niannian laughed, "No wonder the Three Thousand Great Daos collapsed. The real reason is not the Dao Breakers, but you, the Dao Guardians.
The Three Thousand Great Daos guarding the world is an excellent thing in itself, but you Dao Guardians abuse it. If the Spirit of the Great Dao is still here, I'm afraid you'll be angered to death, haha! "
Bai Dizi stared at Mu Niannian, "You actually know about the Spirit of the Great Dao!"
Mu Niannian suddenly turned to look at Ye Xuan, "Remember, the Spirit of the Great Dao is the boss of the Three Thousand Great Daos. If you gather all nine Dao Scriptures, you can summon the Spirit of the Great Dao. At that time, these Dao Guardians will be your little brothers, understand?"
Ye Xuan nodded, "I'll try my best!"
In the distance, Bai Dizi smiled, "He won't have this chance!
Because today, you siblings and this universe will disappear from this world. "
As his voice faded, he turned to look at the depths of the starry sky, "Activate!"
As soon as Bai Dizi's voice faded, in the depths of the distant starry sky, a white light suddenly appeared. The next moment, the white light covered the entire starry sky, and then, countless strange runes suddenly appeared in the white light.
With the appearance of this huge formation, the temperature of the entire Fifth Dimension suddenly soared. Not only that, but the spiritual energy of the entire Fifth Dimension was also disappearing at a speed visible to the naked eye.
This kind of disappearing could be felt personally!
Seeing this scene, Ye Xuan's expression suddenly changed!
In the sky, as Mu Niannian looked at the formation, she slowly clenched her right hand. At this moment, on the battle path, a burly man suddenly appeared. The man was tens of feet tall, and he held a giant axe in his hand. When he appeared on the battle path, the entire world suddenly trembled, as if it could not bear his power.
The man looked down at Mu Niannian below and smiled coldly, "I am the Daoting Giant Ling Tian God. Mortal, the Daoting Ancestor has the virtue of cherishing life, and I advise you to surrender. You should immediately kneel down and kowtow to thank the Heavens.
However, you ate a bear's heart and a leopard's heart, and actually dared to resist my Daoting. You …
...”
At this moment, Mu Niannian suddenly disappeared, and the next moment, the Giant Ling Tian God's expression became ferocious, "How dare you attack in front of this God!"
After saying that, he chopped down with his axe.
This chop directly split the heavens and the earth!
The power of this axe could really destroy this world!
And the opponent's goal was also very obvious, to severely damage this world!
Right at this moment, Mu Niannian's fist suddenly landed on the gigantic axe.
Boom!
Under everyone's gaze, the Giant Axe suddenly exploded, and Mu Niannian arrived in front of the Giant Ling Tian God, she punched the Giant Ling Tian God's head.
Bang!
The Giant Ling Tian God's head directly exploded!
His soul was completely destroyed!
Mu Niannian clapped her hands, "What kind of rubbish is this? Kowtow to thank the Heavens? It's fine if you're used to kneeling, but you want me to kneel like you?"
As she said that, she looked at the formation in the depths of the starry sky, and in front of that formation, 28 super experts had appeared out of nowhere!
Mu Niannian squinted her eyes, "The 28 Lunar Mansions of the legends …"
In the distance, Bai Dizi looked at Mu Niannian, "Your Excellency, even if you have the power to kill the 28 Lunar Mansions, you still can't prevent the Fifth Dimension Calamity from coming today, because every time you attack, it consumes a lot of energy in this universe.
Am I right? "
Mu Niannian was silent.
Bai Dizi faintly smiled, "Look around!"
Ye Xuan looked around. With this glance, he could see very far away.
At this moment, the Fifth Dimension Calamity actually caused mountains to collapse, spiritual energy to disappear, and most importantly, mysterious heavenly lightning.
Fifth Dimension Calamity!
The entire Fifth Dimension Universe was rapidly dying!
Ye Xuan's complexion sank.
At this time, Mu Niannian suddenly smiled, "Why should I prevent the Fifth Dimension Calamity from coming?"
Hearing this, Bai Dizi's pupils suddenly shrank, and a sense of uneasiness rose in her heart.
Mu Niannian looked around and softly said, "I have suppressed it for so long, and in fact, I have reached my limit!
There is not much difference between coming now and coming a few years later … "
As she said that, she suddenly coughed violently. Not only that, but her complexion had also become pale, and there was even a trace of blood at the corner of her mouth …
Seeing this, Bai Dizi was startled, and then he laughed.
He had guessed correctly!
Destroying the Fifth Dimension Universe was equivalent to destroying Mu Niannian!
Because everything about Mu Niannian originated from the Fifth Dimension Universe!
At this time, Ye Xuan suddenly appeared next to Mu Niannian. He grabbed Mu Niannian's hand tightly, "Sister, you rest a bit, I will handle the rest!"
Mu Niannian shook her head, "They came prepared, you are not them …"
Ye Xuan suddenly roared angrily, "Rest!"
Mu Niannian looked at Ye Xuan and saw that Ye Xuan's eyes were red and glistening with tears.
Ye Xuan said with a trembling voice, "Sister, can you believe in me?
I will handle the rest, I will protect this universe, I can do it, you … you should rest well … "
Looking at Ye Xuan's red eyes, Mu Niannian's heart inexplicably softened. She gently wiped away the tears on Ye Xuan's cheeks and softly smiled, "Fool, you don't owe this universe anything … I suddenly regret letting you bear this responsibility!
Will you blame me? "
Ye Xuan hurriedly shook his head, "No, it is only right and proper for me to help sister."
Mu Niannian roared with laughter, and then she pointed at the battle in the sky, "Idiot, you should know that the Dao Court won't let the matter rest today!"
Ye Xuan held Mu Niannian's hand tightly with both hands, "I am not confident of winning, not at all!"
Mu Niannian looked at Ye Xuan, "Then let me rest!"
Ye Xuan grinned, "I just think, if we are going to die today, I want to die before you!"
Mu Niannian's body stiffened, her hand unconsciously holding Ye Xuan's hand tightly, and she forced a smile on her face, "Why?"
Ye Xuan looked at Mu Niannian and grinned, "If I die first, I won't feel heartache.
Also, I will definitely die in Sister Nian's arms, right? "
Mu Niannian looked at Ye Xuan for a long time, then shook her head, "You are so cruel …"
Saying that, she gently wiped away the tears on Ye Xuan's face and softly smiled, "If one day you are bullied, there will only be one reason, and that is because I am not here!
And if one day you die, there will only be one reason, and that is because I am dead. "

Chapter 1337
By the lake, Ye Xuan tightly held Mu Niannian's hand and said with a smile, "None of us will die!"
Mu Niannian smiled but did not say anything.
In the Five-Dimensional Universe.
At this time, the spiritual energy in the Five-Dimensional Universe was gradually collapsing and natural disasters were unceasing.
The earth split open and thick smoke rose. In the depths of the sea, volcanoes erupted and a large amount of magma gushed out. The magma covered the sea and then spread to the land. In the sky, lightning flashed and continuously trampled the earth.
In this part of the universe, countless people were screaming in despair.
Fifth Dimension Calamity!
This was both a natural disaster and a man-made disaster!
By the lake, Ye Xuan tightly held Mu Niannian's hand. Mu Niannian's face was becoming increasingly pale. Clearly, the appearance of the Fifth Dimension Calamity had a great impact on her.
In the horizon, Bai Dizi did not attack again. He was no longer in a hurry.
Because the longer he delayed, the more advantageous it would be for him.
This woman's strength was too heaven-defying. He needed to borrow the power of the Five-Dimensional Universe to weaken Mu Niannian. Otherwise, if he forcefully attacked, Daoting would suffer disastrous losses.
Fortunately, this woman had a weakness!
By the lake, Ye Xuan looked at Mu Niannian and said with a smile, "Sister, let me go first. You take a rest!"
Mu Niannian looked at Ye Xuan and faintly smiled. However, this smile seemed abnormally pale. "Okay!"
Ye Xuan turned around and looked at the horizon. After a moment of silence, he suddenly said, "Today, the Fifth Dimension Calamity has arrived. It is both a natural disaster and a man-made disaster. I, Ye Xuan, am willing to protect this part of the universe with my life. Is there anyone with me?"
His voice was like thunder as it slowly spread throughout the universe.
At this moment, countless experts in the Five-Dimensional Universe heard Ye Xuan's voice.
Countless people raised their heads to look at the source of the voice.
By the lake, Ye Xuan quietly stood there.
He was not sure how many people would come!
Because it was easy to share wealth, but it was also easy to go through trials and tribulations together. Even husband and wife would fly away in the face of disaster. Not to mention that he not only had to face the Fifth Dimension Calamity, but he also had to face the man-made disaster of Daoting!
How many people would come?
Ye Xuan was also at a loss.
At this time, two women suddenly appeared beside Ye Xuan.
An Lanxiu and Lian Wanli!
The two girls glanced at Ye Xuan and didn't say anything.
Ye Xuan didn't say anything.
Suddenly, a ray of sword light resounded in the sky. In the next moment, a woman appeared in the sky. It was Aro!
Aro stood proudly with his sword in hand.
As soon as Aro arrived, there was another flash of sword light. Then, a woman appeared in the sky.
Ah Jiu!
Ah Jiu held a sword in her right hand and a wine gourd in her left. She reeked of wine.
Beside Ah Jiu was a woman with a saber at her waist. It was Situ.
In the sky, Bai Dizi glanced at Aro and the others and smiled, "Not bad, but is that all?"
"Me too!"
Meanwhile, a voice suddenly resounded from the sky, and then a woman appeared above the clouds in the sky.
Three lives!
Seeing Three lives, Bai Dizi said softly, "Dao Shi!"
Three lives glanced at Bai Dizi, "Daoting are all beasts!"
Bai Dizi frowned slightly, "Dao Shi, you used to be one of us, but now …"
Three lives suddenly said angrily, "Ptui!
Old dog Bai Di, tell me, is the current Daoting still the Daoting of the past? "
Bai Dizi shook his head, "There are many problems with the current Daoting, but one day, Daoting will rebuild the order of the world and let the world return to how it was before. No, it will be better than before!"
Three lives sneered, "Just because you people are blinded by greed!"
Bai Dizi shook his head and smiled, then looked at Ye Xuan, "Is there anyone else?"
Ye Xuan was silent.
Up until now, only those close to him had come.
As for the super experts he had nurtured, not a single one of them had come!
Ye Xuan slowly closed his eyes. Was it true that they could only share riches and not trials and tribulations?
Right at this moment, numerous formidable auras suddenly appeared in the distant sky. In the next moment, numerous afterimages flashed over from the horizon!
Ye Xuan suddenly opened his eyes and looked at the horizon. More than a hundred people had appeared. Among them, there were twenty-six true Self Release Realm experts, while the rest were only at the Self Release Realm.
Almost all the Self Release Realm experts of the Fifth Dimension had come!
At this moment, Jiang Yu, who was in the lead, smiled, "Not as fast as Lady Aro and the others!"
Ye Xuan said with a smile, "Do you know what we will face today?"
Jiang Yu looked at Ye Xuan, "If not for Young Master Ye, we would never have been able to reach the Self Release Realm.
Today, the Fifth Dimension is in trouble, Young Master Ye is in trouble, so we will naturally do our best to help! "
Half of it was friendship, and the other half was profit!
In the horizon, Bai Dizi looked at Ye Xuan, "A disaster is approaching, yet there are still so many people willing to be with you. How rare!"
Ye Xuan laughed, "Sacrifice the formation!"
As his voice fell, Old Li suddenly appeared and roared, "Go out!"
Bang!
In an instant, the entire world trembled. A huge formation covered the horizon, and the eye of the formation appeared under Ye Xuan's feet!
Ye Xuan slowly closed his eyes. All around him, the power contained in the formation flowed towards him like a river.
This array contained the accumulated power of countless experts in the entire Fifth Dimension!
As Ye Xuan's power grew stronger, the world started to tremble.
In a short time, Ye Xuan's aura was no weaker than a Dao Confirmation Realm expert. However, Ye Xuan still felt that it was not enough, so he took out two god seals.
Bang!
In an instant, a powerful aura swept out from Ye Xuan's body like a tidal wave, and the entire world became illusory.
Dao Confirmation Realm!
At this moment, Ye Xuan had truly reached the Dao Confirmation Realm. With the addition of the power of the formation, his strength was unprecedentedly powerful!
In the starry sky, Bai Dizi looked at Ye Xuan in silence.
It had to be said that he was somewhat shocked at this moment. In his opinion, the threat of Ye Xuan would come in the future. Mu Niannian was the biggest threat at present, but now it seemed that Ye Xuan was a threat to Daoting!
In the distance, Ye Xuan suddenly raised his head and looked at the formation in the depths of the starry sky. He knew that he had to solve this formation. Otherwise, the situation in the Fifth Dimension would become even worse!
Ye Xuan took a deep breath and opened his palm. The Punishment Heaven Sword appeared in his hand. He looked at the depths of the starry sky, and the next moment, he held the sword with both hands and fiercely slashed.
One sword to determine life and death!
As the sword slashed out, the sound of the sword shook the heavens. At the same time, a wisp of Sword Qi pierced through the sky.
Wherever the Sword Qi passed, the space was annihilated inch by inch. When this wisp of Sword Qi entered the starry sky, the entire starry sky lost its color.
At this moment, there was only this sword in the world!
But Bai Dizi's expression was calm.
In the depths of the starry sky, the 28 constellations suddenly separated. The next moment, a huge constellation formation appeared in front of the formation.
This formation was the famous Four Constellations Divine Formation of Daoting. It was once used to deal with the Dao Tomb.
On this formation, there were 28 kinds of constellation beast statues:
East: Horn Wood Dragon, Kang Gold Dragon, Di Earth Raccoon Dog, Room Sun Rabbit, Heart Moon Fox, Tail Fire Tiger, Water Leopard of Winnowing Basket.
North: Wood Fighting Dog, Golden Ox Niu, Girl Earth Bat, Emptiness Sun Rat, Wei Moon Swallow, Room Fire Pig, Wall Water Centipede.
West: Wood Wolf of Kui, Golden Dog of Lou, Stomach Pheasant, Pleiades Sun Rooster, Moon Crow of Bi, Fire Monkey, Water Monkey of Shen.
South: Wood Dragon of Well, Golden Goat of Ghost, Earth Deer of Willow, Sun Horse of Star, Moon Deer of Extended Net, Winged Fire Snake, Water Worm of Zhen.
At this moment, the Constellation Divine Formation was actually not complete. This was because the 28 Constellation Masters were not here. They were the Azure Dragon Master of the Eastern Constellation, the Black Tortoise Master of the Northern Constellation, the White Tiger Master of the Western Constellation, and the Vermilion Bird Master of the Southern Constellation.
If the four Constellation Masters were here, the power of this formation could easily destroy more than a dozen Dao Defense Realm powerhouses!
Even so, the power of this formation at this moment was still very terrifying!
At this moment, Ye Xuan's shocking sword slashed out. This sword slashed directly on the Constellation Divine Formation.
Boom!
In an instant, a wave of sword light suddenly erupted from the depths of the starry sky.
The sword light dissipated, but the Constellation Divine Formation was still there.
The formation behind the Constellation Divine Formation was undamaged.
Below, Ye Xuan's expression became a little ugly.
This sword attack had failed!
Not only Ye Xuan, but the countless powerhouses of the Fifth Dimension below also had ugly expressions.
The power of Ye Xuan's sword attack just now was enough to destroy the heavens and the earth!
However, this terrifying sword attack had been blocked by the great formation!
Below, Ye Xuan took a deep breath. "Again!"
As his voice fell, he once again absorbed the power of the Fifth Dimension Great Formation. This time, he directly absorbed the power of the great formation.
Boom!
The power contained within Ye Xuan's body was unprecedentedly strong!
Ye Xuan looked at the Constellation Divine Formation in the depths of the starry sky, and a fierce smile appeared at the corner of his mouth. He suddenly leaped into the depths of the starry sky, and then he slashed at the Constellation Divine Formation with his sword.
This sword attack used all of his strength!
As the sword slashed down, the starry sky trembled.
Boom!
In the depths of the starry sky, an earth-shattering explosion suddenly resounded. Then, a wave of sword light erupted from the depths of the starry sky like dazzling fireworks. At this moment, a figure fell from the starry sky!
It was Ye Xuan!
He had failed once again!
After stopping, a wisp of blood flowed from the corner of Ye Xuan's mouth. He wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth and looked at the formation in the depths of the starry sky. His right hand tightly grasped the sword, and the blood in his body trembled.
In the sky, Bai Dizi looked down at Ye Xuan. "This formation was formed by 28 Dao Confirmation Realm powerhouses. Not to mention you, even five Dao Controlling Realm powerhouses wouldn't be able to do anything to this formation!"
Ye Xuan said fiercely, "I still want to try!"
After saying this, he suddenly stomped his right foot, and his entire body shot into the sky.
The sword cry shook the heavens and the earth!
Bai Dizi paid no attention to Ye Xuan, and he glanced at the surroundings with a trace of bewilderment in his eyes.
Logically speaking, the Fifth Dimension Tribulation should have erupted completely by now. However, even though there was a natural disaster in the Fifth Dimension, it hadn't completely erupted yet!
What's going on?
Bai Dizi had a trace of bewilderment in his heart.
Down below, Ye Zhiming had suddenly appeared by Mu Niannian's side. At this moment, Mu Niannian seemed extremely weak, and her face was still pale like a sheet of paper. Her condition wasn't particularly good!
Ye Zhiming glanced at the surroundings, and then he looked at Mu Niannian. Mu Niannian chuckled lightly. "What did you see?"
Ye Zhiming stared fixedly at Mu Niannian. "Was it you!?"
Mu Niannian smiled faintly, but her smile was pale. "What was it me!?"
Ye Zhiming suddenly walked in front of Mu Niannian, and she grabbed Mu Niannian's hand, and slowly closed her eyes. After a moment, her eyes suddenly opened, and she retreated rapidly. Her eyes were filled with disbelief and fear. "My god … No … Impossible … This is absolutely impossible … You …"
....
PS: Asking for votes!!









Chapter 1338
Ye Zhiming seemed to have seen something, but he seemed to have lost his soul. He kept muttering, "Impossible …"
Mu Niannian just smiled and did not say anything. She looked up at Ye Xuan, who was still fighting in the sky. No one knew what she was thinking.
At this moment, Ye Xuan suddenly opened his palm. The Prison Pagoda appeared in his hand. He roared, "Dao Laws, return!"
Boom!
The power of nine Dao Laws suddenly gathered in Ye Xuan's body. At the same time, a powerful force directly enveloped the Constellation Divine Formation.
Ye Xuan suddenly roared, "Imprison!"
As his voice fell, a blood-red "Imprison" word suddenly floated above the Constellation Divine Formation.
Boom!
In an instant, a blood-red light directly enveloped the entire Constellation Divine Formation. At the same time, Ye Xuan's three domains appeared at the same time!
Three domains plus the suppression of the Prison Pagoda!
At this moment, the Constellation Divine Formation was actually suppressed!
Seeing this scene, Bai Dizi slightly frowned. "Revelation of the Five Directions!"
As his voice fell, five super experts suddenly appeared on the battle path!
All five were at the peak of the Dao Confirming Realm!
As soon as the five appeared, they directly rushed towards Ye Xuan.
At this moment, Aro, A 'Jiu, Situ, and An Lanxiu suddenly disappeared. The four directly blocked in front of the Revelation of the Five Directions. Both sides did not waste any words and directly fought!
Although Aro and the other three's realms were weaker than the Revelation of the Five Directions, and they were one person short, the four women did not fall into a disadvantage against the Revelation of the Five Directions!
Below, Three Lives originally wanted to help, but was stopped by Guan Yin. She looked at Three Lives. "Three Lives, we need you to help us block the Yin Qi of the Underworld!"
Not only was the array in the depths of the starry sky destroying the Five-Dimensional Universe, there was also the Yin Qi and Death Qi from the Yin World. Even the Spirit of Dark World found it hard to resist the Yin Qi and Death Qi. It should be said that only the Spirit of Dark World could resist it a little. But now, the entire Spirit of Dark World was resisting the Yin Qi and Death Qi from the Yin World. However, it was far from enough. In addition, there were still the experts from the Yin World who had yet to make a move. Therefore, Three Lives had to stay behind to resist the Yin World!
Right at this moment, a sword howl suddenly resounded from deep within the starry sky. Everyone looked up and saw Ye Xuan's sword slash onto the Constellation Divine Formation.
Boom!
A strand of light erupted once more in the starry sky. The enormous Divine Constellation Formation trembled violently, and then Ye Xuan was blasted back once more. However, cracks had appeared on the formation. Moreover, the Divine Constellation Beasts had even become slightly illusory!
It worked!
Ye Xuan was delighted when he witnessed this scene. He was just about to attack when a halberd suddenly tore through the air towards him!
Ye Xuan subconsciously slashed down with his sword.
Bang!
The halberd was slashed back, but Ye Xuan himself was pushed back by over 100m, and Divine General Xuan Yong wasn't too far away from him!
It's this person again!
Ye Xuan's expression sank.
Right at this moment, a voice suddenly resounded from behind Ye Xuan. "Hey, do you still remember me?"
Ye Xuan was slightly stunned when he heard this. He swiftly turned around and saw a woman standing in front of him.
Jian Zizai!
Ye Xuan was slightly excited. "Big Sister Jian, what are you doing here!?"
Jian Zizai roared with laughter. "I knew you were in trouble, so I came!"
A trace of warmth flowed through Ye Xuan's heart when he heard this.
Meanwhile, Jian Zizai pointed at Xuan Yong in the distance. "I'll deal with this person!"
Ye Xuan spoke in a low voice. "Be careful, Big Sister Jian!"
Jian Zizai roared with laughter. "Don't worry!"
As soon as she finished speaking, she vanished on the spot.
In the distance, Xuan Yong frowned slightly and stabbed out with his halberd, causing space to tremble and crack!
However, Jian Zizai used his fist to forcefully receive the halberd!
The power of his fist was not the slightest bit weaker than the halberd!
Seeing this, Ye Xuan relaxed. He turned to look at the Constellation Divine Formation, and in the next moment, he rushed over once again!
He had to break these two formations, or the situation in the Fifth Dimension would only worsen, and Sister Nian's situation would also worsen.
Seeing Ye Xuan rush over once again, the Constellation Divine Formation suddenly trembled. In the next moment, the 28 beast forms suddenly roared, and 28 powerful forces swept out!
In the distance, Ye Xuan's pupils suddenly shrank, and he suddenly slashed down with his sword.
Boom!
As the sword slashed down, Ye Xuan instantly retreated hundreds of feet, but very quickly, Ye Xuan rushed out again.
In the sky, Bai Dizi did not pay attention to Ye Xuan. Although Ye Xuan was strong, there were 28 people in the 28 Constellations, and they were also supported by the formation. No matter how heaven-defying Ye Xuan was, it was impossible for him to kill the 28 Constellations by himself!
Bai Dizi's gaze was always on Mu Niannian. The person he was most afraid of was this woman!
At this time, Mu Niannian did not seem to have made a move.
Moreover, although Mu Niannian looked pale, she was very calm. She had always been calm!
Why was she so calm?
Bai Dizi suddenly looked to the right. "Lord of the Underworld!"
At this time, the Lord of the Underworld appeared beside Bai Dizi.
The Lord of the Underworld glanced at Mu Niannian below, and there was a trace of fear in the depths of his eyes!
Bai Dizi said indifferently, "We can speed up!"
The Lord of the Underworld was silent.
Bai Dizi smiled. "Don't worry, if Miss Mu makes a move, there will be people in Daoting to restrain her!"
After a moment of silence, the Lord of the Underworld turned his head. "Open!"
As his voice fell, on the other side of the starry sky, the space there suddenly split open. Then, countless amounts of blood-red water suddenly gushed out from the split space!
The water of the River of Forgetfulness!
When the water of the River of Forgetfulness entered this world, the spiritual energy in this world began to dissipate at a terrifying speed.
Seeing this scene, the expressions of the countless experts of the Fifth Dimension below changed!
In addition, countless evil spirits suddenly rushed into the world of the living. After these evil spirits entered the world of the living, they began to crazily devour the yang energy and vitality of the world of the living. For a moment, yin and yang were in chaos, and heaven and earth were overturned!
Below, Mu Niannian looked at all this calmly. After a moment, she suddenly looked at Ye Zhiming and smiled. "Look, how chaotic this world is."
Ye Zhiming looked at Mu Niannian, clenched his fists, and did not say anything.
At this time, Mu Niannian suddenly disappeared. On the horizon, Ye Xuan stopped. When he turned around, Mu Niannian just happened to appear in front of him.
Seeing Mu Niannian's face as pale as paper, Ye Xuan felt very distressed. He tightly grasped Mu Niannian's hand.
Mu Niannian looked around and softly said, "The Three Thousand Grand Daos have already changed!
At the very least, many of them have already changed!
This has already gone against the original will of the Grand Daos.
In this current world, people are not people, gods are not gods, ghosts are not ghosts … "
Ye Xuan was silent.
The Grand Daos!
In the past, the Grand Daos were the order of the world!
But now, the Grand Daos had already been used by someone … The ones in the wrong were not the Grand Daos, but the guardians of the Grand Daos.
In the distance, Bai Dizi looked at Mu Niannian. "Logically speaking, the Fifth Dimension Tribulation should have completely erupted, but it hasn't. It's all because of you!"
Mu Niannian smiled. "Why don't you guess?"
Bai Dizi shook his head. "Young lady, I have to say, you really surprised me. But now, it's time to end this!"
As he said this, he looked at Ye Xuan. "According to our investigation, you seem to have many backers. But if you want to compare numbers and strength, how could you be a match for my Daoting?"
As his voice fell, on the battle path, an old man wearing a daoist robe and holding a horsetail whisk suddenly appeared.
Divine Monarch!
When this Divine Monarch appeared, Ye Xuan's expression instantly became solemn!
After the Divine Monarch appeared, his gaze directly fell on Mu Niannian's body.
It was very clear that Bai Dizi wanted to force Mu Niannian to make a move. This was because as long as Mu Niannian made a move, the destruction of this universe would accelerate. And as the destruction of this universe accelerated, Mu Niannian's strength would become weaker and weaker!
Bai Dizi's goal was very simple. He wanted to use the smallest price to kill Mu Niannian and Ye Xuan.
Because Daoting still had an enemy in the Dao Tomb, he couldn't sacrifice too much in the Fifth Dimension.
Beside Mu Niannian, Ye Xuan suddenly took out a box. This was the box he obtained from the Sword Sect. Ye Xuan was about to open the box when Mu Niannian suddenly shook his head.
Ye Xuan looked at Mu Niannian. Mu Niannian smiled. "It's useless!"
Ye Xuan was a bit puzzled. "Why?"
Mu Niannian smiled. "The little guy inside is not good at fighting!"
Ye Xuan said in a deep voice, "She can call for help!"
Mu Niannian shook his head and smiled. "It's useless. The people who can change all of this are very far away from here. Moreover … letting the Fifth Dimension come early was my choice!"
Ye Xuan's face was filled with shock. "Wh … Why?"
Mu Niannian said in a soft voice, "Because what will come will come!
The reason why I suppressed the Fifth Dimension is because I was waiting, waiting for someone who can deal with the aftermath! "
After saying that, she looked at Ye Xuan and smiled. "I've waited for you!"
Ye Xuan said in a deep voice, "Sister Nian, can't the Fifth Dimension be suppressed forever?"
Mu Niannian shook her head and smiled. "It can't!
Moreover, the longer I suppress it, the greater the rebound. If I continue to suppress it, the rebound will be very terrifying in the future. It might even be something this universe can't bear! "
As she spoke, she turned to look at the universe and said softly, "Actually, this universe is already riddled with holes. I couldn't bear it and forcefully extended its life … But I know that in order to completely preserve this universe, the only way is to destroy the living beings in this universe. However, the living beings in this universe are also a part of this universe!
Moreover, if these creatures were destroyed, there would be more to come.
There would be new life forms … Destruction still could not cure the root of the problem.
The only way is for the living beings of this universe to treat this universe well and coexist with it. "
In the distance, Bai Dizi suddenly laughed and said, "I'm afraid that this young lady's idea will never come true!"
Mu Niannian laughed and looked at the Divine Emperor. "The peak of the Dao Defense Realm, half a step to that level. It seems like Daoting still thinks highly of me!"
The Divine Sovereign looked at Mu Niannian. "Please enlighten me!"
As soon as he finished speaking, he suddenly disappeared.
At this moment, Mu Niannian shook her head and smiled. She gently stretched out her right hand and pointed with a finger.
Boom!
In an instant, a figure retreated rapidly in the sky. This retreat was no less than ten thousand feet. Not only that, the Divine Sovereign's physical body actually disappeared!
Seeing this scene, Bai Dizi's expression changed!
Ye Xuan was also stunned!
Although she destroyed the Divine Sovereign's physical body with one punch, Mu Niannian coughed a few times. Moreover, she coughed up blood!
Most importantly, the entire world seemed to have become somewhat illusory!
The Fifth Dimension Calamity seemed to have sped up!
It was obvious that every time she attacked, it was a disaster for this universe!
Mu Niannian looked down and shook her head. "Now is not the time to fully erupt. I have to leave some time for you, little fellow!"
As soon as she finished speaking, she pressed her left hand down lightly.
In an instant, the Fifth Dimension gradually calmed down.
At this moment, Bai Dizi seemed to have discovered something. Her pupils suddenly shrank. "You … you have been using your own strength to suppress this Fifth Dimension!"
Mu Niannian glanced at Bai Dizi and smiled. "You just realized?"
Bai Dizi trembled. "How much of your strength have you used to suppress the Fifth Dimension?"
The corners of Mu Niannian's mouth curled up. "Take a guess!"
At this moment, everyone present was stunned!
Mu Niannian was using her own strength to suppress the Fifth Dimension. What did this mean?
It meant that the current her was not at her peak state!
Ye Xuan trembled. "Sister Nian, how much strength have you used to suppress the entire Fifth Dimension!"
"Seventy percent!"
At this moment, Ye Zhiming, who was not far away, suddenly spoke. She stared at Mu Niannian. "For countless years, she has been using seventy percent of her strength to suppress this Fifth Dimension!
Her current strength is only thirty percent of her peak state!
It's not even thirty percent! "
Ye Zhiming's voice trembled!
Everyone present was stunned!
Including Ye Xuan.
Not even thirty percent of her peak state was already so terrifying. If Sister Nian withdrew her seventy percent, how terrifying would it be?
Up in the sky, the White Emperor's son was also stunned!
Thirty percent!
Heavens!
The woman in front of him had only used thirty percent of her strength to kill a Divine Monarch!
Thirty percent!
How was this possible?
Bai Dizi held an important position in the Daoting world. What kind of experts had he not seen in his life?
But at this moment, he was panicking!
He was really panicking!
The Lord of the Underworld no longer had fear in his eyes. It was fear!
True fear!
There was actually such a terrifying expert in this world!
Thirty percent of her strength!
In the distance, Ye Zhiming looked at Mu Niannian. "No wonder you said that no medicine could heal your injuries. Your injuries were not caused by others but by yourself. No, you are not injured at all. You are using your life to prolong the life of this Fifth Dimension."
Mu Niannian smiled faintly. Her smile was still a little pale. "What a smart girl!"
Ye Zhiming stared at Mu Niannian. "As long as you give up on the Fifth Dimension, not only will you recover, you will also be invincible in this world!"
Mu Niannian shook her head and smiled. "My injuries will recover. However, this Fifth Dimension will collapse in an instant.
As for being invincible in this world … After those three swords leave this world, I will indeed be invincible … En, no, this is too arrogant!
I have to keep a low profile! "
Everyone: "…"
Ye Zhiming looked at Mu Niannian. "If you don't give up on the Fifth Dimension, you will die!"
Mu Niannian smiled and looked at Ye Xuan. "I will do one last thing for you!"
After saying that, she pulled Ye Xuan's hand and appeared on the Battle Path.
Ye Xuan said with a trembling voice, "Sister Nian, what are you going to do?"
Mu Niannian's lips curled up. "To Daoting!"
Ye Xuan: "…"
In the distance, Bai Dizi said with a trembling voice, "Arrogant!
Woman, you only have thirty percent of your strength. You dare, you … "
On the Battle Path, Mu Niannian laughed without turning her head. "So what if it's thirty percent?
With thirty percent, I, Mu Niannian, will still be invincible in this world! "
...









Chapter 1339
Invincible in the world!
This sentence floated between heaven and earth!
No one thought that Mu Niannian was boasting!
She could kill a Divine Monarch with 30% of her strength!
This strength could not be described with words.
If Mu Niannian was willing to give up the Fifth Dimension, how terrifying would she be at her peak?
It was unimaginable!
Even the White Emperor's son, the Star Lord of the Dao Court, could not have imagined it!
At this moment, Ye Xuan, who was on the Fight Path, suddenly stopped.
Mu Niannian looked at Ye Xuan. Ye Xuan grinned and said with a trembling voice, "Sister Nian, let's let Daoting go!"
Mu Niannian smiled, "I won't die!"
Ye Xuan shook his head and held Mu Niannian's hand tightly, "You know, I have practiced Buddhism … Buddhism is merciful, I … let's let Daoting go!"
Mu Niannian smiled gently, "You are afraid that I will die?"
Ye Xuan nodded.
Mu Niannian smiled, "Besides your Qing 'er, no one can kill me!"
Ye Xuan looked at Mu Niannian and said firmly, "I won't go Daoting!"
Mu Niannian smiled, "It's really fine!"
Ye Xuan shook his head and said with a trembling voice, "Sister Nian, I also know how to trick people, don't trick me!"
Mu Niannian was silent.
Ye Xuan looked at Mu Niannian and was about to speak when Mu Niannian suddenly said, "Daoting will not let you go!"
Ye Xuan said, "I know, but we won't go Daoting today!"
Mu Niannian looked at Ye Xuan for a moment and said with a smile, "I promise you, I will not die!
Sister Nian has never made a promise to anyone, but this time, I promise you! "
Just as Ye Xuan was about to speak, Mu Niannian smiled and said, "Daoting, I must go. Not only for you, but also for a wish of mine!
I've always wanted to have a real fight. Unfortunately, your Qing 'er is too strong. I'm afraid I'll be killed if I fight her. Daoting is the only way!
Moreover … If I can't come back alive, why would I bring you along?
Am I supposed to bring you along to die?
Idiot! "
Ye Xuan hesitated for a moment before he said, "Really?"
Mu Niannian nodded. "I promise you, we will definitely come back alive!"
As she spoke, she seemed to have thought of something. She turned her head to look at the Lord of the Underworld, who was not far away. The latter's expression changed greatly, and just as he was about to retreat, Mu Niannian pointed a finger at him.
Boom!
The space where the Lord of the Nether Realm stood exploded, and the Lord of the Nether Realm was instantly killed!
Mu Niannian raised her head to look at the path in front of her, and then she smiled and said, "Let's go!
Let's go take a look at Daoting! "
As soon as she finished speaking, she pulled Ye Xuan along as she walked towards the end of the path.
Along the way, Mu Niannian ceaselessly sized up the surroundings, and her face was filled with a smile, even though it was a very pale smile.
In next to no time, Mu Niannian and Ye Xuan vanished at the end of the path.
The White Emperor's disciple suddenly vanished along with the 28 Lunar Mansions.
...
Suddenly, Mu Niannian and Ye Xuan appeared in front of an enormous Heaven Gate.
Daoting Heaven Gate!
This gate was 300m long and wide, and it was the main entrance to Daoting!
As soon as Mu Niannian and Ye Xuan appeared before the main entrance, four Guardian Generals suddenly appeared in front of Mu Niannian, and then the Guardian General shouted furiously. "Who dares trespass into the Heaven Gate …?"
Just at this moment, Mu Niannian suddenly vanished on the spot.
Hiss!
A strand of sword light flashed through the battlefield.
Four bloody heads flew into the air, and blood splattered everywhere!
It was an instant kill!
Mu Niannian turned to look at Ye Xuan, and she smiled mischievously. "Isn't it amazing?"
Ye Xuan gave a thumbs up. "Sister Nian is invincible!"
Mu Niannian laughed, and then she pointed at the Heaven Gate. "This is the Daoting Heaven Gate, and behind this gate is the legendary 36 Heavens. The higher you go, the denser the Innate Spiritual Energy is, and the closer you are to the Milky Way, the denser the Star Essence is.
It can be said that there are very few places in the world that can compare to Daoting in terms of spiritual energy. "
Ye Xuan was about to speak, but Bai Dizi suddenly appeared in front of Mu Niannian, and there were four people behind him.
The Four Divine Generals of Daoting!
These four people were not in the Dao Validation Realm, but the peak of the Dao Defense Realm!
Mu Niannian chuckled. "Just the four of them?"
Bai Dizi looked at Mu Niannian. "Miss, we have no intention of offending the Five-Dimensional Universe. Is it worth it for you to be enemies with the Daoting for a human?"
"Is it worth it?"
Mu Niannian shook her head and smiled. "You have to understand that it is you who has always been enemies with us!"
Bai Dizi looked at Mu Niannian. "If he is willing to hand over the Dao Scripture, the Daoting will not kill him. From now on, the Daoting and the Five-Dimensional Universe will mind our own business!"
Mu Niannian suddenly turned to look at Ye Xuan. "Remember, never trust the enemy!"
Ye Xuan said in a deep voice, "I understand!"
Trust the enemy?
How retarded would that be!
Mu Niannian looked at Bai Dizi and smiled. "If he hands over the Dao Scripture, he will temporarily keep his life. However, the Daoting will still think of a way to kill him, right?"
White Emperor.
Zi was silent.
In fact, the Daoting, Ye Xuan, and Mu Niannian could not be friendly!
Whether it was Mu Niannian or Ye Xuan, the Daoting would not let them go.
Those who posed a threat to them had to be exterminated by the roots!
If the Daoting had been more ruthless, the Dao Tomb would not have appeared.
If the roots were not eliminated, Ye Xuan and Mu Niannian would be a disaster in the future!
Mu Niannian suddenly looked at the Four Divine Generals. The Four Divine Generals were about to attack when Bai Dizi suddenly said, "Stand down!"
The Four Heavenly Kings did not hesitate and retreated to the side!
Bai Dizi looked at Mu Niannian. "The purpose of this trip can't be to destroy the Daoting, right?"
Mu Niannian smiled. "What do you think?"
Bai Dizi was silent for a moment and then respectfully retreated to the side.
At this time, a middle-aged man suddenly appeared in front of Mu Niannian.
This person was the Daoting's current Dao Ancestor!
The Daoting's strongest expert!
The Daoting was not stupid enough to send an ordinary expert to deal with Mu Niannian. Why?
Because doing so would be sending them to their deaths!
This Mu Niannian could even kill a God Monarch in a second!
Sending someone else would only be sending them to their deaths, making the Daoting's losses even greater!
Therefore, when Bai Dizi returned to the Daoting, he immediately informed the Dao Ancestor.
Mu Niannian was worthy of the Daoting's strongest expert. The Dao Ancestor appeared!
Only the Dao Ancestor personally took action could prevent the Daoting from losing any experts. Otherwise, it would be useless to send anyone else!
This woman was really too strong!
After the Dao Ancestor appeared, he looked at Mu Niannian and smiled. "The purpose of your trip is not to destroy the Daoting, but to find me!"
Mu Niannian smiled. "Why do you say that?"
The Dao Ancestor pointed at Ye Xuan. "Although this person has the Calamity Cause, his fate is extremely strong. In the entire Daoting, the only person who has a hundred percent chance of breaking his fate is me.
Therefore, your target is me! "
The smile on Mu Niannian's face gradually disappeared.
Ye Xuan looked at Mu Niannian. Mu Niannian smiled. "As expected of the Dao Ancestor. You can see the problem at a glance!"
The Dao Ancestor looked at Mu Niannian. "With thirty percent of your strength, you can kill a Divine Lord.
You surprised me, but you can't kill me. Therefore, I guess you want to seriously injure me. "
Mu Niannian smiled. "Do you think I can do it?"
The Dao Ancestor looked down and said, "If you are willing to give up the Fifth Dimension and let yourself be in a peak state, I will be wary of you.
Your current state … "
Saying this, he shook his head. "You can't do it!"
Mu Niannian laughed. "I'll try!"
The Dao Ancestor nodded. "Then let's try!"
Mu Niannian opened her palm and a sword appeared in her hand. The next moment, she suddenly attacked!
This sword stabbed towards the Dao Ancestor. It was a very calm sword. Even the world's top Swordsman, Ye Xuan, could not see what was special about this sword!
Opposite of Mu Niannian, the Dao Ancestor squinted his eyes. There was a trace of seriousness in his eyes.
When the sword arrived in front of him, he suddenly pointed with his fingers. This point directly touched the tip of the sword.
There were no energy fluctuations. Everything was very calm!
Gradually, the Dao Ancestor's body started to become illusory.
Not far away, the White Emperor's son's expression changed drastically!
At this moment, Mu Niannian suddenly retracted her sword. A smile appeared on her face.
The Dao Ancestor looked at Mu Niannian. His body became more and more illusory.
At this moment, Mu Niannian suddenly disappeared. She raised her sword and attacked.
Bai Dizi's expression changed. He looked at the Dao Ancestor. The Dao Ancestor said softly, "Let her kill!"
Soon, Mu Niannian killed her way to the 33rd Heaven. All the Heavenly Generals in the 33rd Heaven were killed!
At the entrance of the 34th Heaven, Mu Niannian suddenly stopped. She looked at the entrance for a long time and then turned to leave.
In front of the Heavenly Gate, Mu Niannian held Ye Xuan's hand and said with a smile, "Let's go!"
Ye Xuan was stunned. It was over?
At this moment, the Dao Ancestor suddenly said, "You injured me. Even if I don't attack, I Daoting someone can still kill him!
So, what's your next move? "
Mu Niannian said with a smile, "You'll know soon!"
With that, she pulled Ye Xuan and disappeared from the Southern Heavenly Gate.
At this moment, a Heavenly General suddenly appeared in front of the Dao Ancestor. The Heavenly General knelt on one knee. "Dao Ancestor, the army of the Dao Tomb has invaded. The leader is Luo Hou!"
Hearing this, the Dao Ancestor narrowed his eyes and said softly, "This is your next move …"
Bai Dizi said in a deep voice, "Dao Ancestor, if this woman is not killed, I Daoting the future …"
The Dao Ancestor suddenly said, "She's already dead."
Bai Dizi suddenly looked up, his eyes filled with disbelief.
....
Under the Southern Heavenly Gate, Mu Niannian and Ye Xuan walked slowly.
Ye Xuan glanced at Mu Niannian. On the surface, Mu Niannian looked fine.
But for some reason, Ye Xuan felt uneasy.
Mu Niannian suddenly smiled and said, "The Dao Ancestor was crippled by me!
Yes!
He must heal in a short period of time because he didn't dare to not heal. He didn't dare to let himself be injured when facing the person in the Dao Tomb.
Just now, I slaughtered all the experts in the Thirty-three Heavens … This is what I promised others.
In return, the Dao Tomb will send out troops. At this time, the Daoting will not care about you because the threat of the Dao Tomb will be greater.
Simply put, you now have at least half a year. "
Saying that, she looked at Ye Xuan and smiled, "Remember, although the Dao Tomb and the Daoting are sworn enemies, they are still not trustworthy.
Dao Breakers want the Dao Scriptures more than the Daoting because the complete Dao Scriptures can restrain the Daoting.
Therefore, the Dao Tomb should not cooperate with them if you can, because most of the time, they are more terrifying than the Daoting.
Even if you cooperate with them, you must be careful. "
Ye Xuan was about to speak, but Mu Niannian smiled and said, "Let me finish!
You only have half a year, maybe not even half a year!
And in this half a year, if you want to reach the Dao Testimony Realm, you must reach the Dao Testimony Realm.
Of course, even if you reach the Dao Testimony Realm, you can't fight against the Dao Tomb and the Daoting alone.
Therefore, you must find the Dao Scriptures, gather all of them, and awaken the Great Dao Spirit so that it can help you.
Remember, no matter what method you use, you must let the Great Dao Spirit help you! "
Saying that, she coughed and then continued, "In the 3,000 Great Daos, not all the Great Dao Protectors are bad. There are also many good ones. You can befriend those good Great Dao Protectors, or you can find a way to obtain more God Seals. You are now the Lord of the Five-Dimensional Universe, so as long as you can make the creatures of the Five-Dimensional Universe sincerely submit to you, they will believe in you and follow your Great Dao Laws. This way, your strength will increase, and the more God Seals you have, the stronger you will be!"
Just as Ye Xuan was about to speak, Mu Niannian continued, "A long time ago, the world was in chaos. The sky tilted to the northwest and the earth sank to the southeast. The Great Dao was not complete, so an expert used a five-colored divine stone to repair the world … and the Three Lives Technique was one of them. She didn't know how terrifying she was.
"Furthermore, this girl's temperament isn't bad, and she trusts you. You can cultivate her Three Lives Art. This art is indeed only inferior to the Dao Scripture's mental cultivation method. After you cultivate the Three Lives Art, you will obtain the power of three lives. This power can fuse with your Sword Dao, allowing it to reach a new height.
This is because the Three Lives Technique itself is a kind of Great Dao. "
Saying that, she paused for a moment, then continued, "There is also Ye Zhiming. She comes from the Great Abyss, a group of sinners from the Ancient God Era. They also want the Dao Scriptures because they can wash away their sins and allow them to escape.
Ye Zhiming follows you for this purpose.
I have observed this girl, and her feelings for you are a bit complicated. You must be on guard against her, because in the future, it is very likely that she will choose to abandon you for her family. Of course, it is also possible that she will abandon her people for you.
In any case, you must be on your guard and not fall into her trap. "
Just as Ye Xuan was about to speak, Mu Niannian continued, "The Lord of the Underworld has already been destroyed by me. Right now, the Underworld is like a group of dragons without a leader. You can take over the Underworld and rule over those ghosts … but you must be careful. In the Eighteen Levels of the Underworld, there is a Dao Breaker. This person is extremely powerful, and I originally wanted to kill him to get rid of a hidden danger for you. However, this person is also a pitiful person, and he has never had any ill intentions towards you, so I spared his life."
Saying that, she looked at Ye Xuan and smiled, "Remember, in the future, you must think twice before you act. There is nothing wrong with thinking more and being more cautious.
Especially now, you must learn to hide your strength. Right now, you have not reached the point where those forces will stop at nothing to kill you, but if you show off a bit more, they will stop at nothing to kill you! "
Ye Xuan said with a trembling voice, "Sister Nian … why are you saying this to me …"
Mu Niannian smiled, "Because I … I am already dead!"
After saying that, she suddenly went limp.
Ye Xuan's expression changed greatly, and he hurriedly hugged Mu Niannian and said with a trembling voice, "Sister Nian, you were fine, what nonsense are you talking about …"
Mu Niannian reached out and gently wiped away the tears on Ye Xuan's cheeks, "Don't blame yourself, don't be sad, because this is my own choice.
I have protected the Fifth Dimension for countless years, and I have long been exhausted … I am already very satisfied to be able to meet you in my final moments.
However, from now on, you will really have to walk alone.
Also, after I die, bring me back to the Fifth Dimension, and then bury my body in the starry sky of the Fifth Dimension. My soul will scatter between heaven and earth … I was born in the Fifth Dimension, so naturally, when I die, I will naturally die in the Fifth Dimension … Also, when the time comes, remember to cook a few roasted fish for me … "
"No!"
Ye Xuan tightly hugged Mu Niannian, sobbing uncontrollably.
Mu Niannian gently stroked Ye Xuan's cheek with her left hand, feeling a little heartache, "Before, I was not afraid of death at all, because a long time ago, I had already thought of this ending.
But now, I am a little afraid of death!
Because I am afraid that after I die, there will be no one to protect you … But, Sister Nian is really tired, Sister Nian wants to have a good rest … "
As her voice fell, her breath was almost gone.
Finally, Mu Niannian turned her head and looked at the Fifth Dimension that she had protected for countless years …
The corners of her mouth curled up slightly …
This was the last time she smiled.
It was also the last time she saw it.
Now, she could finally rest.
....

Chapter 1340
In the starry sky, Ye Xuan tightly hugged Mu Niannian, sobbing like a child.
In his embrace, Mu Niannian had already stopped breathing.
As if he had thought of something, Ye Xuan took out all the violet energy he had for Mu Niannian to absorb. However, it was useless. The moment the violet energy entered Mu Niannian's body, it automatically dispersed!
Seeing this, Ye Xuan sat paralyzed in the starry sky. His eyes were empty, as if he had lost his soul.
At this time, a white figure suddenly appeared not far away from Ye Xuan.
This white figure was Ling'er, who had been following Mu Niannian all this time.
Ye Xuan suddenly looked at Ling'er. "She … She didn't die, right?"
Ling'er held Mu Niannian's hand and softly said, "She is already dead."
Ye Xuan's voice trembled. "How … How is that possible … Sister Nian is so strong … She only used 30% of her strength to seriously injure a Dao Ancestor. How could she die … Impossible …"
Ling'er glanced at Ye Xuan. On her face, two streams of clear liquid slowly flowed. "90,000 years!
She used her body to suppress the Fifth Dimension for 90,000 years!
Every time the Fifth Dimension Tribulation came, she was the one who endured it … Although she suppressed the Fifth Dimension Tribulation, she suffered a backlash … "
Ye Xuan tightly hugged Mu Niannian. His body could not stop trembling. "How could you be so stupid!"
Ling'er softly said, "Just like she said, this was her own choice!
She chose death!
For you, for the Fifth Dimension! "
Ye Xuan looked at Ling'er. Ling'er wiped the tears on her face. "In fact, the Fifth Dimension Tribulation can no longer be suppressed. The more it is suppressed, the greater the backlash will be in the future. Therefore, she chose to let the Fifth Dimension Tribulation come early!"
With that, she looked down and softly said, "The reason why the Fifth Dimension Tribulation has not completely erupted is because she is suppressing it. In other words, she withstood at least 90% of the Fifth Dimension Tribulation's power.
You saw her weak before not because she made a move, but because her body was withstanding the Fifth Dimension Tribulation. "
Ye Xuan looked at Ling'er. "She could withstand it before, so why couldn't she withstand it this time?"
Ling'er looked at Ye Xuan. "Because this time, there is a man-made disaster!"
Ye Xuan slowly closed his eyes.
Daoting!
Ling 'er continued, "You don't need to blame yourself too much. This is her choice. She chose to save the Fifth Dimension.
If she doesn't choose the Five-Dimensional Universe, the Dao Court won't be able to do anything to her. If she doesn't give up on the Five-Dimensional Universe, her injuries will only worsen … "
Ye Xuan shook his head. "You're wrong!"
Ling 'er looked at Ye Xuan. Ye Xuan said softly, "She went to Daoting for me. If she didn't go to Daoting, she wouldn't have died, right?"
Ling 'er looked at Ye Xuan. She clenched her fists as tears poured out of her eyes. "It's you, it's you!
If not for you, she wouldn't have died! "
With that, she suddenly knelt down in front of Mu Niannian's body. She clutched Mu Niannian tightly and wailed, "You fool!
I've already told you to stay out of his business, but you just wouldn't listen. He's a person with a Calamity Cause! "
At the side, Ye Xuan's eyes were empty, as if he had lost his soul. Two streams of clear liquid flowed down his face.
Ling'er suddenly looked at Ye Xuan. She stared at Ye Xuan. "Do you know why she went to Daoting?
Because she wanted to buy time for you!
And now, she used her life to buy time for you for half a year … If not for you, although she would have been seriously injured, she wouldn't have died!
It's you, you're the one who killed her! "
Ye Xuan hugged Mu Niannian tightly. "I'm sorry … I'm sorry …"
Ling'er still wanted to say something. At this time, Ye Xuan's black hair began to turn white. In just a few breaths, Ye Xuan's black hair had turned snow white.
Seeing this, Ling'er was stunned. She didn't say anything.
At this time, Ye Xuan suddenly picked up Mu Niannian. He gently stroked Mu Niannian's messy hair and grinned. "Sister Nian, let's go home!"
Back to the Five-Dimensional Universe!
Ye Xuan carried Mu Niannian's body and walked down.
...
Ye Xuan brought Mu Niannian's body to the Five-Dimensional Universe.
After arriving in the Five-Dimensional Universe, Mu Niannian's body gradually became illusory. In her body, a force spread out and finally dissipated between heaven and earth like a light breeze …
That was Mu Niannian's soul power!
Ye Xuan wanted to catch it, but it was impossible, not even with the Soul Suppressing Sword!
In Little Soul's words: This soul has dispersed.
After Mu Niannian's soul dispersed between heaven and earth, her body suddenly changed. In the end, the Mu Niannian in Ye Xuan's arms turned into a pure white kitten …
Seeing this scene, Ye Xuan was stunned.
At this moment, he finally understood why Mu Niannian liked to eat fish so much.
Ye Xuan brought Mu Niannian to the starry sky where she often roasted fish. It was very quiet here. He placed Mu Niannian's body in the starry sky. From this position, he could overlook the Five-Dimensional Universe below.
The body was buried in the starry sky, the soul returned to heaven and earth!
Ye Xuan looked at Mu Niannian. After a long time, he smiled and said: "Sister Nian, have a good rest."
With that, he turned and left.
And he was not going back to the Five-Dimensional Universe!
On the side, Ling 'er said with a trembling voice: "Where are you going!"
Ye Xuan did not turn his head.
Ling 'er was about to say something when a black object suddenly fell in front of her.
Prison Pagoda!
Ye Xuan left behind the Prison Pagoda!
What was he going to do?
Ling 'er was somewhat confused.
At this time, big sister's voice suddenly sounded from inside the Prison Pagoda, "Not good, he's going to do something stupid!
Quickly stop him! "
Ling 'er was stunned. Then, she hurriedly chased after him. However, Ye Xuan had already disappeared into the starry sky.
Ling 'er angrily roared at the starry sky, "You're going to die!"
In the depths of the starry sky, a voice slowly floated over, "Then die!"
..
Ye Xuan once again arrived in front of the Heavenly Gate. One person, one sword.
Just as Ye Xuan arrived in front of the Heavenly Gate, Bai Dizi appeared in front of him. Bai Dizi looked at the white-haired Ye Xuan and shook his head: "Stupid!
Haven't you heard that ten years is not too late for a gentleman to take revenge?
Coming here now is very stupid. "
"Ten years?"
Ye Xuan grinned: "This daddy can't wait that long!"
As his voice fell, a blood-red aura suddenly swept out from his body!
Bang!
In an instant, the sky above the Heavenly Gate turned blood red!
Bloodline activation!
At this moment, Ye Xuan completely entered a crazed state!
This time, he did not rely on the sword spirit!
Kill!
That was the only thought in Ye Xuan's mind!
After he completely activated the power of the bloodline, the sword spirit in his hand also turned blood red at this moment.
Usually, he was unable to unleash the sword spirit's power. However, after the bloodline activation, he could unleash at least 30% of the sword spirit's power!
The crazier the owner of this sword, the stronger it was!
Seeing Ye Xuan's aura skyrocket, Bai Dizi frowned slightly. The power of the bloodline was a little beyond his expectations!
At this moment, a man suddenly appeared in front of Ye Xuan.
This person was God General Xuan Yong!
Looking at the blood-red Ye Xuan, Xuan Yong gradually frowned. At this moment, Ye Xuan made him feel danger!
The stronger the murderous intent, the stronger the power of the bloodline!
At this moment, Ye Xuan's murderous intent had never been so strong!
Kill!
At this moment, only killing intent remained in Ye Xuan's mind!
Ye Xuan suddenly vanished on the spot. Xuan Yong's eyes narrowed slightly as he stabbed his halberd forward.
Bang!
An expanse of blood red light suddenly erupted, and then Xuan Yong was instantly pushed over 1km back. As soon as he stopped moving, the halberd in his hand had suddenly cracked apart!
Bai Dizi frowned slightly when he witnessed this scene!
Xuan Yong gazed at Ye Xuan with a trace of disbelief in his eyes.
Suddenly, Ye Xuan roared furiously, "Kill!"
As soon as he finished speaking, a ray of blood red light suddenly arrived in front of Xuan Yong. Xuan Yong's eyes narrowed slightly as he raised his halberd to block it.
Bang!
An explosion resounded as Xuan Yong was pushed 3km back. This time, the halberd in his hand had been slashed into pieces!
Xuan Yong raised his head to gaze at Ye Xuan. In the end, his gaze descended onto the sword in Ye Xuan's grasp, "What sort of sword is that? It was actually able to shatter me …."
Right at this moment, Ye Xuan vanished on the spot again.
Xuan Yong's pupils constricted, and then he clenched his right hand into a fist and smashed it forward.
At the instant he punched forward, the space in front of him had instantly transformed into a strange vortex!
A strand of obliterating energy swept out from within the vortex, and it collided head-on with Ye Xuan's blood red ray of light!
Rumble!
An expanse of blood red light suddenly erupted from the Heaven Entrance, and then a figure retreated repeatedly.
It was Xuan Yong.
Xuan Yong hadn't even stopped moving when Ye Xuan slashed once more.
A wisp of ferocity flashed through Xuan Yong's eyes, and then he clenched his fists tightly and smashed them forward.
Rumble!
The space in the surroundings suddenly trembled violently while Xuan Yong instantly retreated explosively. At this moment, his strength had been directly suppressed by the energy of Ye Xuan's bloodline and Sword Dao!
Bai Dizi's face fell when he witnessed this scene.
He noticed that Ye Xuan's aura was growing stronger and stronger!
What sort of bloodline is this?
Right at this moment, Ye Xuan suddenly vanished with his blood red sword in hand.
Bai Dizi's expression changed drastically, and he hurriedly said, "Watch out!"
On the other side, Xuan Yong seemed to have sensed something, and his pupils had suddenly constricted to the size of needles. He swiftly swept his arms forward, and a strand of formidable force swept out from within him like a volcanic eruption.
Using defense as offense!
Meanwhile, two mysterious forces suddenly enveloped the surroundings.
The Sword Domain and Blood Domain!
The Sword Domain and Blood Domain were countless times stronger than before. Especially the Blood Domain. After Ye Xuan activated the energy of his bloodline, the Blood Domain was unprecedentedly strong.
A strand of blood red ray of light suddenly slashed down from within the Blood Domain.
Hiss!
The energy that Xuan Yong had released was directly shattered by this sword. At the same time, Ye Xuan's sword slashed directly into the top of Xuan Yong's head, and Xuan Yong's body was directly cut into two!
Xuan Yong's soul was just about to flee when the sword in Ye Xuan's hand had suddenly transformed into the Soul Quelling Sword, and the Soul Quelling Sword directly entered the space between the brows of Xuan Yong's soul.
Bang!
Xuan Yong's formidable soul was directly absorbed!
A sword slashed through the body!
A sword slashed through the soul!
Ye Xuan gestured with his right hand, and the Soul Quelling Sword flew back into his hand. Then, he raised the sword and killed his way into the Heaven Gate without looking back … Behind him was a sea of blood.
Killing intent arose, and the world was slaughtered.
If he didn't go mad, he wouldn't survive!
....









Chapter 1341
In front of the Heavenly Gate, Bai Dizi looked at the dismembered Xuan Yong with an extremely ugly expression.
He did not expect that Ye Xuan would become so powerful after activating the power of his bloodline!
He had killed a Divine General!
At this moment, Bai Dizi's eyes were solemn.
The Daoting was currently empty because Luo Hou had personally led the army of the Dao Tomb, so most of the experts of the Daoting had gone to the Celestial Abyss.
As if he had thought of something, Bai Dizi suddenly said, "Quickly recall the Four Heavenly Kings!"
A voice rang out behind Bai Dizi. "Yes, Sir!"
At this moment, a Heavenly General suddenly appeared in front of Bai Dizi. He bowed respectfully and said in a trembling voice, "Sir, Ye Xuan has already killed his way into the First Heaven!"
Hearing this, Bai Dizi narrowed his eyes and was about to speak when another Heavenly General appeared in front of Bai Dizi. "Sir, Ye Xuan has already killed his way into the Sixth Heaven …"
Bai Dizi was speechless.
At this moment, Ye Xuan had already killed his way into the Eleventh Heaven.
In fact, there was originally a super expert guarding each of the 36 Heavens. However, Mu Niannian had already killed the expert guarding the 36 Heavens!
In addition, most of the super experts of the Daoting were in the Celestial Abyss, so Ye Xuan was almost invincible along the way.
He killed his way to the Eleventh Heaven, and during this period, he had killed at least a thousand Heavenly Generals.
They were all instant kills!
At this moment, the power of his sword was difficult to resist even for Dao Confirmation experts!
Soon, Ye Xuan killed his way to the Twentieth Heaven, and at this moment, the experts he encountered were all Dao Confirmation experts!
However, these Dao Confirmation experts were still unable to stop him.
Mu Niannian only killed the strongest experts of each Heaven, but Ye Xuan was different. He killed everyone he saw. It could be said that he had killed almost all the experts of each Heaven.
Under such a massacre, Ye Xuan's killing intent grew stronger and stronger!
Just as Ye Xuan arrived at the 21st Heaven, Bai Dizi suddenly appeared in front of him.
Bai Dizi stared at Ye Xuan. At this moment, he was extremely shocked!
Because he noticed that Ye Xuan's aura was at least twice as strong as when he was in the Heavenly Gate!
This guy was getting stronger and stronger!
How could this be?
Bai Dizi looked at Ye Xuan. Soon, he discovered the crux of the problem!
The power of bloodline!
Ye Xuan's bloodline power was getting stronger and stronger!
What kind of bloodline power was this?
Bai Dizi frowned slightly. He'd investigated Ye Xuan earlier, but he'd neglected Ye Xuan's bloodline.
Meanwhile, Ye Xuan suddenly looked at Bai Dizi. He was about to attack when a furious shout resounded from afar, "How dare you!"
As soon as the voice resounded, a ray of black light flashed!
Ye Xuan turned around and slashed down with his sword.
Bang!
That black light directly exploded, and Ye Xuan also retreated more than a hundred feet!
A robust middle-aged man stood in front of Ye Xuan. The middle-aged man wore golden armor, held a golden hammer in his left hand, and held an umbrella in his right.
It was one of the Four Heavenly Kings of Daoting, Multilore!
Bai Dizi frowned slightly when he saw Multilore, "Multilore, why are you alone?"
Multilore glanced at Bai Dizi, "Starlord, the battle at the Celestial Abyss is very intense!"
Bai Dizi's face sank when he heard this.
Meanwhile, Multilore looked at Ye Xuan, "I alone am enough to kill this kid!"
Bai Dizi looked at Multilore, "Don't be careless and underestimate him!"
Multilore laughed, "I know!"
As soon as he finished speaking, he suddenly leaped up and smashed his hammer down at Ye Xuan. The 22 levels of the Celestial Abyss trembled violently like an earthquake, and it was extremely shocking!
Ye Xuan suddenly raised his head, and his eyes were like a sea of blood that struck fear into the hearts of others.
Ye Xuan didn't dodge, and he just stabbed with his sword.
In an instant, a blood technique drowned him and Multilore.
Bang!
Along with a loud bang that shook the heavens, a figure retreated rapidly, and he retreated for an entire 300m!
It was Ye Xuan!
Within that bloody light, Multilore casually swung his hammer, and the bloody light was instantly dispersed.
Multilore looked into the distance and sneered, "This kid has some ability, to actually be able to take my punch head-on!
Again! "
As soon as he finished speaking, he suddenly vanished on the spot, and in the next moment, a golden hammer suddenly smashed down from above Ye Xuan's head.
Under this hammer strike, the space around Ye Xuan directly warped!
Ye Xuan suddenly raised his head and roared furiously. A bloody light shot into the sky from his body, and this bloody light actually forcefully blocked that shocking hammer strike!
Multilore's expression changed at the sight of this, "What kind of bloodline power is this …"
At this moment, Ye Xuan suddenly vanished on the spot.
Multilore's eyes narrowed slightly, and he suddenly swung his hammer horizontally to the side.
Bang!
A bloody light suddenly exploded from the golden hammer, and Multilore instantly retreated explosively. At this moment, Ye Xuan pressed forward, and in an instant, countless bloody sword lights drowned Multilore!
Boom! Boom!
Boom! Explosions resounded incessantly in the 21st level of heaven!
Even though Ye Xuan hadn't been able to instantly kill Multilore, he'd been able to suppress him!
Bai Dizi's expression grew even more unsightly at the sight of this.
At this moment, Ye Xuan was a little ridiculously strong!
After all, Multilore had encountered a realm!
But Ye Xuan was actually able to rely on this bloodline power to fight Multilore that was two realms above him!
This wasn't just heaven defying, it was abnormal!
Bloodline power!
Bai Dizi stared fixedly at Ye Xuan. He knew that Dao Yi's bloodline power was very special and extremely powerful. However, he'd never seen or even heard of a bloodline like Ye Xuan's!
Suddenly, a huge explosion resounded from afar, and it interrupted Bai Dizi's thoughts. He looked towards the distance and saw that Multilore had actually been pushed over 1km back, and he was surrounded by boundless blood red sword energy!
Multilore suddenly opened the umbrella in his right hand, and then countless strands of golden light surged out from within it. Hiss!
Hiss! Hiss!
In an instant, countless strands of blood red sword qi were torn apart by the golden light, and the sound of something being torn apart resounded incessantly. On the other hand, Ye Xuan was blasted back repeatedly by the golden light, and he was pushed back by almost 3km!
When he stopped moving, there was a huge golden net in front of him.
Multilore suddenly shook the umbrella in his hand, "Retract!"
Bang!
The umbrella shook violently, and then the huge golden net suddenly moved towards Ye Xuan!
Ye Xuan stood on the spot, and he suddenly stabbed with his sword when the golden net arrived in front of him. It was a single strike that contained 3 Domains.
Bang!
The golden net was forcefully stopped by Ye Xuan's attack!
Right at this moment, the umbrella in Polylore's hand suddenly vanished. In the next moment, countless strands of golden energy slashed towards Ye Xuan!
Hiss! Hiss!
Hiss! The blood red light around Ye Xuan exploded apart inch by inch!
At the same time, Multilore suddenly appeared above Ye Xuan, and the golden hammer in his hand smashed down. As soon as the hammer descended, the space around Ye Xuan warped into a strange shape!
Ye Xuan raised his head, and then two rays of blood red light suddenly slashed forward!
Bang!
The two rays of sword energy struck the golden hammer, causing it to tremble violently. However, it merely stopped for a moment, and it wasn't able to stop the hammer from descending.
At this moment, Ye Xuan suddenly stabbed the golden hammer with his sword.
It was a head-on collision!
Rumble!
The entire twenty-first level of heaven suddenly trembled violently. The Multitude Heavenly King retreated rapidly in the air, while Ye Xuan retreated nearly a thousand feet!
Suddenly, Ye Xuan roared furiously. He leaped up with his sword in hand and slashed towards Multilore. Multilore's expression changed, and he raised the umbrella in his hand.
Bang!
A wave of blood red light erupted from the top of the umbrella.
Crack!
The treasured umbrella immediately cracked open!
Polylore's expression changed drastically at the sight of this, and he subconsciously put away his umbrella. At this moment, Ye Xuan's sword stabbed towards his forehead. Polylore didn't choose to retreat, nor could he. He swung his golden hammer horizontally, and this swing was aimed directly at Ye Xuan's head!
A life for a life!
Ye Xuan didn't put his sword away.
Multilore didn't put his hammer away either!
Hiss!
Ye Xuan's sword stabbed into Multilore's throat, but Multilore's hammer stopped a few inches away from Ye Xuan's head!
Because a sword had blocked this hammer strike!
Soul Suppressing Sword!
Soul Suppressing Sword had attacked by itself, and it had nothing to do with Ye Xuan.
The spirit sword was protecting its master!
Ye Xuan's Soul Suppressing Sword was no ordinary Soul Suppressing Sword. After absorbing the souls of countless powerhouses, the sword had proven itself. Even without Ye Xuan, it was still comparable to a Dao Validation powerhouse!
At this time, Ye Xuan suddenly put away his sword spirit, and it turned back into Soul Suppressing Sword. He stabbed the sword into the center of Multilore's forehead once more.
Boom!
In the blink of an eye, Multilore's soul was absorbed!
Dual swords!
One sword to cut the body!
One sword to shatter the soul!
When he saw Multilore's death, Bai Dizi slowly clenched his right hand.
He didn't attack.
Because he was a Star Lord, one of the few people in the Daoting who wasn't good at fighting!
He was a civil official in the Daoting, and was in charge of the Daoting's affairs. As for fighting, it wasn't something he was good at.
Of course, it wasn't that he didn't know how to fight, he just wasn't good at it.
Ye Xuan put away Soul Suppressing Sword, and he took a deep breath. In an instant, Multilore's blood was directly absorbed by him!
Along the way, he had absorbed the blood of every single person he killed!
Soul Suppressing Sword absorbed souls, and he devoured blood!
After absorbing Multilore's blood, Ye Xuan turned to look at Bai Dizi. Bai Dizi took a deep look at Ye Xuan, and quietly disappeared.
Ye Xuan carried the two swords and continued forward. Soon, he arrived at the 22nd Heaven, and there was no one in the 22nd Heaven!
Previously, Bai Dizi had already ordered everyone in the 22nd Heaven to retreat!
Those people staying in the 22nd Heaven would be sending them to their deaths!
Seeing that there was no one in the 22nd Heaven, Ye Xuan continued forward. This time, he moved faster.
...
In front of the Heavenly Gate, Bai Dizi suddenly looked at a Heavenly General. "Go to the Two Worlds Abyss and tell True Martial Divine Lord that Multilore is dead!"
The Heavenly General bowed respectfully and quietly left.
Bai Dizi looked at the 36th Heaven, and said, "I want to know where this person's bloodline comes from … Quickly investigate!"
"Yes, Sir!"
A voice came from not far behind Bai Dizi.
Bai Dizi slowly closed his eyes. "Weeds must be cut by the roots!"

Chapter 1342
At this moment, Ye Xuan had already killed his way to the 27th Heaven!
Now, Ye Xuan was covered in blood!
Massacre!
Ye Xuan himself did not realize that the stronger the killing intent in his mind, the more terrifying the power of the Power of Bloodline was!
Now, the killing intent emitted from his body was unprecedentedly strong, even surpassing his sword intent!
Moreover, every time he killed someone, his killing intent and the Power of Bloodline would increase.
The more he killed, the stronger he would become!
Grow in the midst of massacre!
Of course, he could also die in the midst of massacre!
When Ye Xuan came here, he had already put his life and death aside.
He had come here and completely activated the power of his bloodline just to do one thing: kill!
After killing his way to the 27th Heaven, those experts did not resist, but retreated!
The current Ye Xuan was unstoppable!
And Ye Xuan did not let these people go!
Chase!
Just like that, Ye Xuan chased wildly, and the entire 27th Heaven was filled with wails.
Not long after, Ye Xuan killed his way to the 33rd Heaven.
The spiritual energy here was much denser than below, and there was extremely pure energy of the stars. Ye Xuan did not absorb the energy of the stars, but his body was indeed automatically absorbing the pure energy of the stars.
After absorbing the energy of the stars, Ye Xuan came to the entrance of the 34th Heaven. At this moment, the blood sword in his hand trembled slightly.
Ye Xuan stopped!
The sword spirit stopped Ye Xuan!
Ye Xuan stood at the entrance in silence for a moment, then he turned and left.
After Ye Xuan left the 36th Heaven, he came to a stretch of clouds. From his position, above those clouds, there were floating palaces!
Daoting heaven palaces were 36, and 72 Treasure Halls were 72.
Ye Xuan suddenly disappeared on the spot. His target was the head of the Treasure Halls, Ling Xiao Hall!
The Lingxiao Hall was where the Dao Ancestor resided.
However, Ye Xuan did not let go of the great halls and heavenly palaces he passed by. Wherever he went, there was chaos.
Seeing Ye Xuan rush to the Numinous Sky Palace, Bai Dizi's expression changed instantly!
He had previously ordered the Daoting powerhouses to avoid Ye Xuan and not fight to the death with Ye Xuan. They were to wait for the Daoting powerhouses to return from the Dual Realm Abyss. But now, he did not expect Ye Xuan to go to Lingxiao Hall.
That was the place where the Dao Ancestor lived. It was the dignity of the Daoting.
Bai Dizi suddenly said, "Where are the 36 Celestial Stars!"
Chi chi chi chi …
In an instant, streams of light shot into the sky from the Daoting. Soon, the 36 super powerhouses suddenly appeared in front of Ye Xuan. Bai Dizi was about to speak, but Ye Xuan suddenly turned into a sword light and disappeared on the spot.
In the distance, the 36 super powerhouses suddenly turned into 36 streams of light and shot toward Ye Xuan.
In the clouds, Ye Xuan suddenly slashed down with his sword.
Chi chi!
A stretch of sword light and a heavenly waterfall swept down from the sky!
Bai Dizi's expression changed drastically when he saw this!
Ye Xuan had become stronger again!
At this moment, a dazzling blood light suddenly burst out from the sky. Under this blood light, the 36 super powerhouses were shaken and retreated repeatedly.
A single sword strike had forced back 36 Dao Validation powerhouses!
Seeing that the 36 super powerhouses still wanted to attack, Bai Dizi suddenly said angrily, "Don't attack, retreat!"
At this moment, he'd noticed that Dao Validation Realm experts were utterly unable to harm Ye Xuan!
These 36 Dao Validation Realm experts had limitless futures, so they absolutely couldn't be allowed to die here. At the very least, they couldn't be allowed to die for nothing!
The 36 Celestial Stars were just about to retreat when Ye Xuan suddenly vanished on the spot.
Hiss!
A strand of blood red light flashed through the battlefield.
The expressions of the 36 experts changed drastically when they witnessed this scene, and they retreated explosively.
However, Ye Xuan's sword was even swifter than them!
Hiss!
Ye Xuan's sword pierced through the throat of one of the experts in the lead, and then his head instantly flew into the air while a strand of blood sprayed from it!
Moreover, his soul and blood were instantly absorbed by Ye Xuan. In the next moment, Ye Xuan vanished on the spot again. It didn't take long for the sound of ripping to resound, and every single ripping sound was accompanied by a head flying into the air!
They were bound to die as soon as they appeared here. Because their speed wasn't as fast as Ye Xuan at all!
Bai Dizi stared fixedly at the blood red light in the sky with an extremely unsightly expression on his face.
Because he noticed that Ye Xuan was much stronger than he was a moment ago!
Exactly what sort of bloodline is that?
Bai Dizi's heart was filled with questions!
Because the people he'd sent still hadn't replied to him. This meant that they still hadn't found him!
But with the strength that Daoting possessed, that was utterly impossible!
Even Daoting had a pretty good understanding of the Dao Tomb, let alone a human at the Self Release Realm!
At this moment, Ye Xuan, who was far away in the sky, suddenly stopped. Around him were 36 withered corpses.
Ye Xuan's eyes were closed tightly while strands of formidable killing intent surged incessantly around him. The killing intent was so strong that it had completely crushed his Sword Intent!
Moreover, killing people wasn't able to vent his anger. Conversely, it caused his killing intent to grow stronger and stronger!
Even if he slaughtered all the worlds in the universe, it wouldn't be able to quench the hatred in his heart.
Meanwhile, Ye Xuan suddenly vanished on the spot, and the palaces in the distance were reduced to nothingness by the blood red sword light ….
In a short while, Ye Xuan arrived before the Firmament Hall. The Firmament Hall was made of glass, and it was 300m tall and extremely dazzling.
Behind Ye Xuan was a ground full of corpses!
Ye Xuan looked at the Firmament Hall and suddenly slashed with his sword.
Hiss!
Everywhere the sword light passed, a sea of blood was left!
Just as the blood red sword light was about to strike the Firmament Hall, a ray of gold light suddenly struck the blood red sword light.
Bang!
The sword light and the blood red sword light shattered at the same time!
On Ye Xuan's right stood a man in golden armor and a longbow in his hand!
One of the Daoting Divine Generals: Farewell!
Wan Bie looked at Ye Xuan expressionlessly.
At this moment, Bai Dizi instantly heaved a sigh of relief. As if he thought of something, he suddenly said, "Divine General Farewell, just hold this person back. Don't fight him head-on!"
Wan Bie glanced at Bai Dizi and said, "Lord Bai Xing, is he the one who killed Xuan Yong?"
Bai Dizi nodded. "Yes!
This person's bloodline power is extremely special. His current strength has increased by at least ten times. Although he's at the Self Release Realm, with this bloodline power and the sword in his hand, his current combat strength isn't any weaker than a Dao Controlling Realm expert! "
Wan Bie glanced at the sword in Ye Xuan's hand and said softly, "This sword …"
Bai Dizi said solemnly, "The strength of this sword lies in the realm, not the body. This sword shouldn't be his sword. I wonder if it's Mu Niannian …"
At this moment, the distant Ye Xuan suddenly turned into a sword light and disappeared. He slashed at Farewell!
Farewell's expression was calm. The moment Ye Xuan attacked, he suddenly drew his bow and released it. A golden arrow light tore through the air.
Boom!
This arrow forcibly blocked the distant Ye Xuan, but the next moment, Ye Xuan disappeared again. The moment Ye Xuan disappeared, Farewell also disappeared. As soon as he disappeared, a sword stabbed at his position, and Ye Xuan's sword pierced through thin air.
The moment Ye Xuan was about to withdraw his sword, a long arrow tore through the air and shot straight at his forehead.
Ye Xuan blocked it with his sword.
Boom!
The arrow was blocked, but Ye Xuan retreated several hundred feet!
The moment he stopped, another arrow tore through the air.
And as soon as he stopped, another arrow tore through the air.
Ye Xuan took a step forward and thrust his sword forward. On the tip of the sword, a beam of sword light suddenly exploded. Along with the explosion, a golden arrow also exploded. However, there was another arrow behind this one!
This arrow, Ye Xuan was unable to block, and directly pierced his chest!
Chi!
The arrow entered half an inch!
At this moment, Ye Xuan's powerful physical body showed its effect!
Seeing this, Lan Bie in the distance frowned slightly. "Such a powerful body …"
Ye Xuan suddenly pulled out the arrow, and a stream of blood spurted out, but he quickly absorbed it.
Ye Xuan looked up at Farewell in the distance. At this moment, the seriousness in Farewell's eyes increased.
Ye Xuan suddenly disappeared, and the moment Ye Xuan disappeared, Farewell also disappeared once again!
Soon, there were many afterimages in the clouds. These afterimages could no longer be distinguished as Ye Xuan's or others'. In addition, there were also sword light and arrow light!
Below, Bai Dizi's expression was somewhat ugly.
Although the two seemed to be equally matched, and neither could do anything to the other, he knew that Ye Xuan actually had the upper hand!
Right now, Farewell was constantly pulling away from Ye Xuan, and once Ye Xuan closed in on him, it would be the moment of his defeat!
Right now, although Ye Xuan could not close the distance, other arrows could not hurt Ye Xuan either!
Most importantly, Ye Xuan was becoming stronger and stronger!
If this continued, Farewell would definitely lose!
As if thinking of something, Bai Dizi suddenly turned his head and looked at the end of the horizon. He said softly, "The battle in the Two Realms Abyss is so intense …"
When he sent someone to pass the news of Polylore's death to True Martial Divine Lord, he should have known the seriousness of the matter!
But now, the experts of the Two Realms Abyss had not come.
This Farewell did not come from the Two Realms Abyss. Before that, Farewell had been in seclusion. When he saw that Ye Xuan was coming to Numinous Sky Hall, he had sent someone to forcefully inform Farewell!
Now, it was likely that Farewell would not be able to stop Ye Xuan!
At this moment, the sound of a sword suddenly rang in the sky. Then, a figure retreated rapidly. The person retreating was Farewell!
In the process of retreating, Farewell drew his bow again and again, and more than a dozen arrows shot at Ye Xuan from various angles. In the distance, Ye Xuan suddenly waved his right hand, and in an instant, more than a dozen swords appeared around him. In the next moment, these swords transformed into more than a dozen beams of sword light and flew out!
Sword Kinesis Flight!
Sword Kinesis Flight alone could not compete with Farewell's arrows, but with the power of his bloodline and his sword domain, it was completely different!
Long-range attack?
So could Ye Xuan!
Psst psst psst psst!
Flying swords and flying arrows crisscrossed in the sky above Numinous Sky Hall, and the sound of tearing kept ringing …
The battle was in a stalemate!
At this moment, Bai Dizi suddenly turned his head, as if he had seen something. He suddenly breathed a sigh of relief. "It's time to end this!"
At the end of the clouds, a middle-aged man slowly walked over. The middle-aged man held a long sword without a scabbard. The sword was dark purple, and a golden dragon swam along the blade. The sword let out a dragon's roar from time to time.
The Dragonsong Sword!
This sword contained the dragon's soul. When the sword was swung, the dragon's roar could be heard.
Although this sword was only at the Dao Validation realm, with the addition of the dragon's soul, the sword's power far surpassed that of ordinary Dao Validation realm swords!
On the middle-aged man's back, there was a sword case. The sword case was extraordinary. It was made of the dragon's bone and was indestructible. In the sword case, there were ten divine swords. All ten divine swords were made of dragon scales, and all of them were at the Dao Validation realm!
Sealing the Dao!
Daoting the Dragon-slaying Sword Immortal!
Daoting the number one Swordsman!
.....









Chapter 1343
Feng Daoxiu!
Upon seeing this person, the White Emperor's son heaved a sigh of relief.
Feng Daoxiu was not only at the Dao Defense Realm, but he was also a Swordsman and a Super Swordsman!
It could be said that Feng Daoxiu was the most powerful person in Daoting except for the White-robed Divine General.
How could Ye Xuan resist Feng Daoxiu and Bidding?
Feng Daoxiu stopped not far away. He glanced at Ye Xuan and then looked at Bai Dizi. "Lord Taibai Jinxing, is this person the one?"
Bai Dizi nodded.
Feng Daoxiu was expressionless. "Tell Bidding to stop. I want to fight this person one-on-one!"
Bai Dizi frowned slightly. "Feng Daoxiu is a taboo for a martial artist to look down on his enemy!"
Feng Daoxiu shook his head. "I'm not looking down on him. I just want to fight him one-on-one and have a fair fight!
I want to see what this Swordsman is capable of! "
Bai Dizi shook his head. "No, I order you to kill this person immediately!"
Feng Daoxiu frowned slightly.
Bai Dizi looked at Feng Daoxiu with a cold expression. "Do you want me to report you to the True Martial God?"
Feng Daoxiu's expression changed slightly. He did not dare to go against Bai Dizi. Although Bai Dizi was not very powerful, his official position was higher than his. Even his superior, the True Martial God, had to be polite to Bai Dizi.
Feng Daoxiu cupped his fists. "I'll do it!"
After that, he looked at Ye Xuan and Bidding, who were still fighting fiercely in the distance. The next moment, the Dragoncry Sword in his hand suddenly turned into a sword light and slashed out. There was the roar of a dragon's soul in the sword light!
In the distance, Ye Xuan suddenly turned his head and was about to block with his sword. How would Bidding give Ye Xuan the chance to do so?
In an instant, Bidding shot more than a dozen arrows. These arrows were as fast as lightning and arrived in front of Ye Xuan in the blink of an eye!
If Ye Xuan blocked that sword, he would definitely be hit by the arrow!
However, Ye Xuan did not block the Dragon's Cry Sword. He turned around and fiercely swung his sword. In an instant, all the other arrows were blocked. At this time, the Dragon's Cry Sword had already arrived behind Ye Xuan. At this time, it was already too late for Ye Xuan to defend. The Dragon's Cry Sword easily pierced into Ye Xuan's back.
Seeing this, the people in the distance immediately relaxed a little.
He had to admit that Ye Xuan was indeed difficult to deal with. If this continued, he would definitely lose!
Because he couldn't outlast Ye Xuan!
Ye Xuan was constantly getting stronger!
When the Dragon's Cry Sword stabbed into Ye Xuan's back, Feng Daoxiu didn't stop because he still had another move!
At practically the exact same moment, 10 divine swords shot into the sky from within the Swordsman on his back. In the next moment, they shot through space and instantly arrived around Ye Xuan. After that, they entered Ye Xuan's body at practically the exact same moment as the Dragon's Cry Sword!
11 Sword Strikes!
From the moment he attacked until the end, his movements were completed in one smooth motion, and it wasn't flashy at all.
At this moment, the surroundings suddenly fell silent!
The rock that was hanging in Bai Dizi's heart had finally been lifted!
The vigilance in Bidding's eyes had vanished completely at this moment.
Meanwhile, Feng Daoxiu suddenly shook his head, "How boring!"
Right at this moment, Bai Dizi seemed to have thought of something, and his pupils constricted, "Watch out …."
At practically the exact same moment, Ye Xuan suddenly vanished on the spot, and it only took a moment for him to arrive in front of Bidding. Bidding's expression changed drastically when he witnessed this scene. What the hell?
Bidding was caught off guard, and Bidding allowed Ye Xuan to close in on him!
How could a ranged attacker survive when an assassin closed in on him?
Bidding didn't choose to retreat because it was too late now. He was just about to draw his bow when a sword suddenly stabbed into his chest.
Bang!
Bidding was instantly blasted over 1km away by the sword!
Once Bidding stopped, he gazed at the sword in his chest.
The Soul Suppression Sword!
Once it entered his body, his soul wouldn't even have a chance to escape!
Bidding was slightly stunned, and he gazed at Ye Xuan. At this moment, there were 11 swords stuck into Ye Xuan's body, and there was even a sword stuck into his head!
However, Ye Xuan was fine!
How could this be possible?
At this moment, Feng Daoxiu was stunned as well.
。
How could this be possible?
Right at this moment, the swords on Ye Xuan's body suddenly started to slowly disperse!
"He's absorbing them!"
Bidding stared fixedly at Ye Xuan, "He's absorbing the swords!"
Seeing his swords slowly disappear, Feng Daoxiu's face was filled with shock. "How is this possible …"
In the distance, Bai Dizi slowly closed his eyes.
Regret!
At this moment, Bai Dizi was filled with regret!
In fact, when he investigated Ye Xuan previously, in Ye Xuan's information, there was a mention of Ye Xuan being able to absorb swords.
However, he didn't take it seriously!
This was because he thought that perhaps Ye Xuan's constitution was a little special, and there was no powerful Swordsman below, so Ye Xuan could absorb swords. Therefore, he didn't take it seriously at all.
However, he didn't expect that Ye Xuan could even absorb swords of Dao Validation State!
After all, this Feng Daoxiu was not an ordinary Swordsman!
Even his swords could be absorbed?
What kind of constitution was this?
At this moment, Ye Xuan had completely absorbed the 11 swords.
Boom!
An extremely powerful aura suddenly swept out from Ye Xuan.
At this moment, Ye Xuan's aura multiplied. The aura was so powerful that the space around him cracked!
This was a direct breakthrough in quality!
In the distance, Wanbie was stunned. He looked at Feng Daoxiu not far away and asked, "Were you sent by the other side?"
As soon as he finished speaking, his soul was completely absorbed. He died.
After his death, he didn't even close his eyes.
He died with everlasting regret!
He wasn't killed by Ye Xuan. He was killed by his own people!
In the distance, Feng Daoxiu's expression was extremely ugly. His 11 swords had been absorbed!
Eleven swords!
Even the Divine Dragon's Soul had been absorbed by Ye Xuan!
What was this?
Feng Daoxiu looked at Bai Di Xing Jun. Bai Dizi stared at Ye Xuan in the distance. "Retreat!"
Retreat?
Feng Daoxiu's expression suddenly turned ferocious. He suddenly waved his hands. "Ten Thousand Swords to the Origin!"
In an instant, tens of thousands of flying swords suddenly appeared in the sky.
Feng Daoxiu pointed angrily at Ye Xuan, who was still absorbing the swords, and roared, "Slash!"
As soon as he spoke, tens of thousands of swords suddenly pierced through the sky. In an instant, tens of thousands of swords directly drowned Ye Xuan.
Feng Daoxiu stared into the distance. Soon, his expression changed!
Ye Xuan was absorbing the swords!
Those tens of thousands of swords were directly absorbed by Ye Xuan!
At this moment, Ye Xuan's aura suddenly skyrocketed!
He became stronger again!
Feng Daoxiu's face was extremely pale. His eyes were filled with disbelief. "How is this possible … How is this possible …"
As if unwilling to give up, Feng Daoxiu was about to attack again. At this moment, Bai Dizi suddenly roared angrily in the distance. "Stop it right now!"
Feng Daoxiu looked at Bai Dizi. Bai Dizi pointed into the distance. "Hurry up and get lost!"
Feng Daoxiu was speechless.
Bai Dizi suddenly roared angrily once more. "Do you want to die here?"
Feng Daoxiu flew into a rage when he saw Bai Dizi fly into a rage. "Don't talk nonsense. If you're so capable, why don't you attack?"
Bai Dizi glanced coldly at Feng Daoxiu. He did not say another word, and he retreated silently.
On the other hand, Feng Daoxiu looked at Ye Xuan in the distance with an extremely hideous expression. He opened his palm, and an energy sword appeared in his hand. In an instant, boundless spiritual energy in the heavens and the earth started to surge from this energy sword.
Feng Daoxiu stared fixedly at Ye Xuan. "I don't believe that you can absorb more!"
As soon as he finished speaking, he suddenly took a step forward. As soon as he took that step, the energy sword in his hand suddenly flew out and slashed.
Hiss!
A sword howl suddenly resounded through the sky!
Under Feng Daoxiu's gaze, the energy sword slashed directly onto Ye Xuan's body.
Bang!
Ye Xuan's entire body shook, and then he shuddered. He seemed to be very comfortable!
I've been absorbed again!
At this moment, Feng Daoxiu's face was ashen. "How … how is this possible …?"
As he spoke, he charged directly at Ye Xuan. In the next moment, numerous flying swords slashed towards Ye Xuan!
Every time Feng Daoxiu swung his sword, Ye Xuan's aura would grow slightly stronger …
At this moment, Feng Daoxiu had gone mad, and he attacked madly at Ye Xuan!
Around 15 minutes later, Ye Xuan suddenly vanished on the spot.
Feng Daoxiu's expression changed drastically. He was just about to attack when a sword had already pierced through the space between his brows!
Hiss!
Blood sprayed!
Ye Xuan appeared behind Feng Daoxiu, and then he clenched his right hand. The Soul Suppressing Sword flew out from Feng Daoxiu's body and descended firmly into his grasp.
Feng Daoxiu's soul had been destroyed!
After Ye Xuan killed Feng Daoxiu with a single strike, he walked towards the Firmament Hall. There were two portraits on both sides of the Firmament Hall's door.
The Gatekeepers!
Ye Xuan had just arrived before the door when the two portraits suddenly opened their eyes. In the next moment, two rays of golden light slashed directly at Ye Xuan!
Ye Xuan swung his sword horizontally from below.
Hiss!
The two rays of golden light shattered, and in the next moment, Ye Xuan vanished on the spot. Hiss!
Hiss!
The heads of those two Divine Generals flew into the air!
At the instant their heads hit the ground, Ye Xuan had already entered the Firmament Hall.
The hall was resplendent and extremely luxurious.
After Ye Xuan entered the hall, he glanced at the surroundings, and then he suddenly slashed with his sword!
Hiss!
A strand of sword light suddenly erupted from within the Firmament Hall. In an instant, the entire Firmament Hall shattered into pieces.
Ye Xuan had left the Firmament Hall, but he hadn't left. Instead, he had slaughtered madly throughout the Daoting Hall!
He had slaughtered from the south to the north, and from the north to the south …
The entire Daoting's 36 Heavenly Palaces and 72 Palaces had been visited by him … For a time, the entire Daoting Hall was filled with wailing victims!
About an hour later, Ye Xuan returned to the Heavenly Gate. He sat paralyzed on the ground because there was no one left for him to kill.
At this moment, Bai Dizi suddenly appeared in front of Ye Xuan. Ye Xuan suddenly raised his head to look at Bai Dizi. He picked up his sword and was about to attack. At this moment, Bai Dizi suddenly said, "It was you who caused the death of the Fifth Dimension Tendo!"
There was a mysterious power in his voice, and this power directly penetrated deep into Ye Xuan's body.
At this moment, Ye Xuan, who had lost his mind, suddenly stopped.
Bai Dizi stared at Ye Xuan and said, "It was you who caused her death!
If it wasn't for you, she wouldn't have died!
She is already dead, so what right do you have to live in this world? "
At this moment, two streams of bloody tears slowly flowed out from Ye Xuan's eyes.
Bai Dizi continued, "She could have lived well, but it was because of you that she came to Daoting and used the last of her strength to fight to the death with us, the Daoting Dao Ancestor. If it wasn't for you, how could she have died with her strength?
It was you, Ye Xuan, who caused her death! "
Killing Heart!
In the distance, Ye Xuan's body suddenly began to tremble. He suddenly muttered, "It was … I … who caused … sister's death …"
Bai Dizi suddenly roared in anger, "It was you!"
His voice was like a great bell, shaking the heavens.
At this moment, Ye Xuan suddenly held the sword across his throat. He looked at the horizon, as if he had lost his soul, "It was me … I deserve … to die …"
As his voice fell, he suddenly swiped.
Chi!
A stream of blood splattered out.
Ye Xuan slowly fell down. His left hand stretched out into the distance. In the horizon, he saw a woman smiling at him. In the woman's hand, there was a fish …
But there was nothing in the horizon.
Ye Xuan suddenly grinned, "Nian … sister … In the next life, I will roast fish for you for a lifetime …"

Chapter 1344
Seeing the scene of Ye Xuan lying down, Bai Dizi, who was far away, suddenly laughed.
He laughed very happily!
A very steady god was now laughing like a child who had received a gift!
Actually, he just wanted to give it a try.
The battle in the Two Worlds Abyss was in a stalemate. There was no one there, and the Daoting had to deal with the Tomb of Dao.
Because if the Daoting retreated, the Two Worlds Abyss would fall into the Tomb of Dao. At that time, the situation would be extremely disadvantageous for the Daoting.
Therefore, Divine Lord True Martial could not send the White-robed General and some other Divine Lords back.
There was no other way!
Therefore, he chose to use the Words of Death to deal with Ye Xuan.
He knew that the reason why Ye Xuan slaughtered the Daoting powerhouses so crazily was because of Mu Niannian!
Guilt!
At that moment, Ye Xuan must be feeling extremely guilty.
Therefore, Bai Dizi wanted to try to arouse the guilt in Ye Xuan's heart … and he succeeded!
Ye Xuan actually killed himself in front of him!
This was really delightful!
However, soon, the smile on Bai Dizi's face froze.
In the distance, a monstrous killing intent suddenly swept out from Ye Xuan's body. This killing intent swept across the sky like a storm, then spread towards the entire Daoting. In an instant, the entire Daoting was shrouded by a killing intent!
Bai Dizi's face was full of disbelief. "This is …"
At that moment, Ye Xuan, who had been lying on the ground in the distance, suddenly stood up slowly.
Not dead?
Bai Dizi stared at Ye Xuan. "This …"
At that moment, Ye Xuan suddenly pointed his sword at the sky.
Boom!
A sword condensed from killing intent suddenly shot into the sky. In an instant, the entire space above the Daoting was shattered by that sword!
After all, the space in the Dao Court was extremely sturdy!
Previously, Ye Xuan's parting battle had not been able to shatter the surrounding space, but now, Ye Xuan's sword had shattered the space so easily!
As if he had thought of something, Bai Dizi's face suddenly turned pale. "Proving the Way … You … Proving the Way by killing …"
His voice was trembling!
Killing to prove one's Dao!
Killing intent rose, slaughtering the world!
But what was the limit of killing intent?
The ultimate killing intent was to kill oneself!
A person who even wanted to kill himself, his killing intent was the most terrifying and extreme.
At this moment, Bai Dizi suddenly roared, "Impossible!
From ancient times until now, all those who killed to prove their Dao had perished!
You can't be alive! "
There were indeed people in history who used killing to prove their Dao.
Killing oneself could indeed prove one's Dao, but since ancient times, it was only proven before one died.
In the history of Daoting, there was one person who used killing to prove his Dao, and that person perished after proving his Dao.
Proving one's Dao by killing was not something that could be achieved by pretending, it was a person who really wanted to kill himself. Without the real intention to commit suicide, it was impossible to prove one's Dao.
Therefore, from ancient times until now, those who used killing to prove their Dao all perished at the same time!
But now, Ye Xuan was actually still alive.
How was this possible?
Soon, Bai Dizi discovered the problem.
He stared at Ye Xuan, or more accurately, at the sword in Ye Xuan's hand!
Sword!
This guy could absorb swords!
It was impossible to kill him with swords!
Moreover, he could not kill himself with swords. With his current Sword Dao cultivation base and strength, only Mu Niannian could kill him with swords.
An expert of that level!
At this moment, Bai Dizi suddenly slapped his face, "This dog mouth of mine!"
His old face instantly turned red and swollen!
As if he felt that it was not enough, Bai Dizi slapped his old face a few more times.
Let Ye Xuan commit suicide?
At this moment, Bai Dizi wanted to die.
Damn it, what kind of stupid move did I make?
I'm simply an idiot!
Bai Dizi was filled with regret!
Ye Xuan was only at Self Release Realm previously, but he could already kill Dao Controlling Realm experts. Now, Ye Xuan reached Dao Validation Realm, and he used killing to prove his Dao!
Using killing to prove his Dao!
This method of proving one's Dao was extremely domineering and terrifying. It could be said that using the sword to prove one's Dao wasn't as terrifying as using killing to prove one's Dao. Once the intent to kill arose, who could resist it?
The current Ye Xuan, not to mention Dao Controlling Realm experts, even ordinary Divine Lords in Daoting were probably no match for him!
The current Ye Xuan was a great threat!
Bai Dizi took a deep look at Ye Xuan, then left silently.
In the distance, Ye Xuan's eyes were closed tightly, and the killing intent around him was almost tangible.
Killing domain!
The fourth type of domain!
Using killing to prove one's Dao, using killing to form a domain!
At this moment, Ye Xuan reached Dao Validation Realm without the help of a God's Seal. Not only that, but he also used killing to form a domain.
In fact, he could directly use killing to prove one's Dao, not only because of his killing intent, but also because he had devoured those swords!
Eleven swords, that wasn't just any ordinary nourishment!
Especially when that Feng Daoxiu even frantically increased his energy …
Before he used killing to prove one's Dao, his own strength had actually already reached a limit. At the moment when he committed suicide, killing intent arose, and coupled with the strength from before, he used killing to prove one's Dao!
Now was the moment when he was at his peak!
In the battlefield, Ye Xuan released the killing intent in his body in a frenzy. His killing intent swept towards the surroundings, and at this moment, Daoting was enveloped by his killing intent.
However, Ye Xuan did not notice that the sword in his hand was also becoming stronger!
The Sword Spirit!
The sword that used to belong to the green-robed man!
The strength of the Three Swords didn't lie in the sword, but in the person. The stronger the person, the stronger the sword!
However, the Sword Spirit was different. Not only did it not have a cultivation, but it had once followed its former master and used killing to prove one's Dao!
Although Ye Xuan could not fully unleash its power, after using killing to prove one's Dao, Ye Xuan could unleash at least 50% of its strength!
The stronger the killing intent, the stronger the sword!
Coupled with his Blood Domain and the power of his bloodline, his Dao of Killing would be unprecedentedly powerful!
Around 15 minutes later, Ye Xuan slowly calmed down, but he still had not returned to normal.
Ye Xuan walked away with the sword in hand.
Continue killing!
Just like before, there was only one thought in his mind, and that was to kill. Kill everyone in Daoting!
Leave no one alive!
Ye Xuan killed from the south to the north, then from the south to the west …
In Daoting, he killed every living thing he saw!
The entire Daoting was filled with corpses.
Just as Ye Xuan walked out of a palace with the sword in hand, a middle-aged man suddenly appeared in front of him.
Ye Xuan's killing intent disappeared without a trace when it was half a foot in front of the middle-aged man!
The powerful killing intent could not even get close to the middle-aged man!
The middle-aged man in front of him was the Tao Ancestor who had gone into seclusion to heal his injuries!
Beside the Tao Ancestor was Bai Dizi.
The Tao Ancestor looked at Ye Xuan in the distance. "You two!
Brother and sister, each more demonic than the other! "
In fact, he had been Daoting all along, but he did not come out earlier because the most important thing to him was to heal his injuries!
Mu Niannian had seriously injured him and destroyed his body, which was very fatal to him.
This was because Daoting had a mortal enemy: the Dao Tomb!
Fortunately, the one in the Dao Tomb was in seclusion, or Daoting would be in danger.
Therefore, he had to rebuild his body before the one in Daoting went into seclusion, so that he could recover to his peak condition!
But now, he had no choice but to come out!
Ye Xuan had proven his Dao by killing!
If it was just a normal Dao Proving, he would not come out because Ye Xuan could not threaten Daoting. However, proving his Dao by killing was different!
Great killing intent!
Why would he have such a great killing intent?
Because Ye Xuan wanted to destroy Daoting!
How much killing intent and hatred did he have to prove his Dao?
The Tao Ancestor knew that he had to come out and kill Ye Xuan. The current Ye Xuan was no longer a threat to the Dao Tomb. If he was allowed to grow, Ye Xuan would become the Dao Tomb's greatest enemy in the future!
This was his intuition!
The Tao Ancestor looked at Ye Xuan and slowly raised his right hand. "It's over!"
As soon as he finished speaking, a powerful force suddenly appeared around him. As soon as this force appeared, the killing intent in the surroundings slowly dissipated!
Bai Dizi retreated to the side and looked at Ye Xuan. This time, this guy should die, right?
Although Ye Xuan's current strength was unprecedentedly strong, the person in front of Ye Xuan was the Tao Ancestor!
One of the strongest in the world!
Ye Xuan seemed to have sensed danger from afar. He held the Sword Spirit tightly in his right hand, and a powerful force swept out from within him.
After a moment of silence, Ye Xuan suddenly leaped up and slashed down with his sword.
Hiss!
A single slash could destroy the world!
This slash tore the space in the surroundings apart!
At this moment, the Tao Ancestor suddenly threw a punch. It was a very ordinary punch, and there was not even the slightest energy fluctuation. However, in the instant that he threw that punch, the sword momentum of Ye Xuan's sword instantly disappeared. At the same time, Ye Xuan's entire body was sent flying. This time, he flew from the south gate to the north gate.
As soon as Ye Xuan landed on the ground, the space behind him turned into nothingness, and he spat out a few mouthfuls of Blood Essence.
In front of the south gate, the Tao Ancestor took a step forward. With one step, he came directly in front of Ye Xuan.
The Tao Ancestor gazed at Ye Xuan with an expressionless face, "If your sister was here, then I would show her some respect. Unfortunately, she isn't here!
But I won't give you any time or chance! "
As soon as he finished speaking, he smashed his fist forward once more!
Ye Xuan suddenly raised his head, roared furiously, and slashed down with his sword.
Four types of Domains!
Bang!
As soon as his sword descended, the space here suddenly exploded apart, and Ye Xuan retreated 30km!
However, the Tao Ancestor retreated a few meters as well!
Bai Dizi's expression became extremely solemn when he witnessed this scene.
He'd repelled the Tao Ancestor with a single strike of his sword!
Bai Dizi clenched his fists tightly. If Ye Xuan doesn't die, then he'll definitely become a great calamity for the Daoting in the future!
The Tao Ancestor's eyes were filled with killing intent as well, and he stared at Ye Xuan who was 30km away, "I really can't let you live!"
As soon as he finished speaking, he'd appeared in front of Ye Xuan, and then he smashed his fist forward once more. Meanwhile, a woman suddenly appeared in front of Ye Xuan, and she smashed her fist forward as well.
Bang!
The force of the Tao Ancestor's fist was instantly destroyed. At the same time, the Tao Ancestor was blasted over 1km away!
The Tao Ancestor stared fixedly at the woman in the distance.
.....









Chapter 1345
The woman who had just appeared was none other than Ye Ling.
Of course, Ye Ling wasn't the one who was in control of the body.
After she repelled the Dao Ancestor with a single punch, Ye Ling turned to look at Ye Xuan. Ye Xuan's mind was still abnormal.
Ye Ling fell silent for a moment before she suddenly pressed her right hand against Ye Xuan's shoulder. In an instant, Ye Xuan's killing intent was suppressed within Ye Xuan's body, and then she left with Ye Xuan.
Suddenly, the Dao Ancestor said, "Are you leaving just like that?"
Ye Ling suddenly turned around and punched.
A ray of dim light flashed across the battlefield!
The Dao Ancestor's eyes narrowed slightly as he punched forward.
Bang!
The space there trembled violently, and then the Dao Ancestor retreated 3km away!
After he stopped, the Dao Ancestor's expression became unprecedentedly solemn.
In the distance, Ye Ling didn't attack again. Instead, she left with Ye Xuan.
The Dao Ancestor didn't dare attack again!
The Dao Ancestor stared fixedly at Ye Xuan and Ye Ling who'd vanished into the distance, and then he said, "Investigate!"
Bai Dizi nodded and left silently.
The Dao Ancestor slowly closed his eyes. "Ye Xuan …."
At this moment, he was both shocked and furious!
The Fifth Dimension Tendo was gone!
However, another mysterious expert had appeared behind Ye Xuan!
What exactly is the power behind Ye Xuan?
The Dao Ancestor remained silent for a long time before he turned around and left.
He had to reconstruct his body as soon as possible!
...
Ye Ling brought Ye Xuan back to the Fifth Dimension. Ye Ling stood in the starry sky and looked at Mu Niannian's main body in the distance. No one knew what she was thinking.
Behind Ye Ling was Ye Xuan. At this moment, Ye Xuan was gradually returning to normal. However, his white hair had not returned to normal.
Ye Xuan slowly stood up. He looked at Ye Ling and said in a trembling voice, "Ling'er?"
Ye Ling turned around and looked at Ye Xuan. "Did you enjoy killing them?"
Ye Xuan said in a deep voice, "Ling 'er, why did you come back at this time?"
Ye Ling turned to look at Mu Niannian's true form in the distance and said softly, "A few days ago, she found me!"
Sister Nian!
Ye Xuan looked at Mu Niannian's body in the distance and slowly clenched his fists.
Ye Ling turned to look at Ye Xuan. "She said that her path has come to an end!
However, she was worried about you. She said that after she left, you might do something stupid, so she hoped that I would come back to help.
She was right, you will indeed do something stupid! "
Ye Xuan lowered his head slightly and remained silent.
Ye Ling walked in front of Ye Xuan. "Raise your head and look at me!"
Ye Xuan looked at Ye Ling. At some point, his cheeks were covered in tears.
Ye Ling looked straight at Ye Xuan. "It's not that you can't die, but if you die like that, will you be able to face her, who died for you?"
Ye Xuan was silent.
Ye Ling continued, "She gave up everything for this universe. Now, look at this universe. What kind of situation is this universe in now?"
Ye Xuan turned around and looked. At this time, the Fifth Dimension was already fragmenting.
Fortunately, Mu Niannian's power still existed!
She did not use the remaining 70% of her power until her death!
It was also because of the 70% of her power that the entire Fifth Dimension was not fragmented. However, the situation was still not good. Although the Fifth Dimension's Fifth Dimension Calamity had not completely erupted, it had already descended. All kinds of natural and man-made disasters were unceasing.
In short, the current Fifth Dimension was very chaotic!
As if thinking of something, Ye Xuan suddenly shook his head and said with a trembling voice, "Sister Nian … You are really stupid …"
Ye Ling suddenly said, "She is not stupid. This was her choice.
She chose you, chose the Fifth Dimension. "
Ye Xuan slowly closed his eyes. "Sister Nian, you …
Don't worry, I will govern the Fifth Dimension well! "
As he said this, he looked at Ye Ling. "After coming back, will you still leave?"
Ye Ling nodded.
Ye Xuan was about to speak when Ye Ling said, "Give me the coffin in your body!"
Ye Xuan was stunned. Then, he took out the ice coffin.
Looking at the ice coffin in front of him, Ye Ling's eyes flashed with a trace of complexity.
Ye Xuan asked, "Do you know who is inside?"
Ye Ling nodded. She put away the coffin and looked at Ye Xuan. "Lend me your sister's body for a period of time. Don't worry, I will not harm her. On the contrary, she will follow me and receive all my inheritance. I will also teach her with all my heart!"
Ye Xuan quickly cupped his fists. "Many thanks!"
Ye Ling turned her head and looked at Mu Niannian's body. Then, she said, "I am leaving!"
After saying this, she was about to leave.
At this time, Ye Xuan suddenly asked, "Can you kill that Dao Ancestor?"
Ye Ling looked at Ye Xuan. "I can. However, your sister's body cannot withstand too much of my power."
Ye Xuan was silent.
Ye Ling pointed at Mu Niannian's body in the distance. Then, she said, "You will take revenge for her yourself!"
After saying this, she turned around and disappeared at the end of the Milky Way.
In the same place, Ye Xuan was silent.
At this time, a woman suddenly appeared beside Ye Xuan.
Ye Zhiming!
Ye Zhiming looked at Ye Xuan without saying a word.
In fact, she was also here to scold Ye Xuan. This was because she knew that Ye Xuan had gone to the Daoting. However, when she saw Ye Xuan, she couldn't bring herself to scold him.
Regarding Mu Niannian's death, Ye Xuan was the one who suffered the most!
At this time, Ye Xuan suddenly turned around and looked at Ye Zhiming. "What is the current situation in the Fifth Dimension?"
Ye Zhiming looked at Ye Xuan. "They are all waiting for you!"
Ye Xuan nodded. "Let's return!"
After saying this, he left with Ye Zhiming.
After Ye Xuan and Ye Zhiming left, Ye Ling appeared again.
She looked at Mu Niannian who was lying quietly in the distance and said softly, "You were born because of the Fifth Dimension, and now you will die because of the Fifth Dimension …"
After saying this, she looked at the Fifth Dimension below her. "Little guy, you have to cure the Fifth Dimension!
Otherwise, you will regret it for the rest of your life. "
After saying this, she looked at Mu Niannian who was lying in the starry sky. "Miss, we will meet again!"
After saying this, she disappeared.
In the starry sky, Mu Niannian was lying quietly …
...
When they saw that Ye Xuan had returned safely, Guan Yin and the rest heaved a sigh of relief.
When they found out that Ye Xuan had gone to the Daoting, they were shocked. That was Daoting!
But fortunately, Ye Xuan had returned!
In a large hall, all the Self Release Realm experts of the entire Fifth Dimension were gathered.
Everyone was looking at Ye Xuan.
Ye Xuan suddenly looked at Jiang Yu. "Pavilion Master Jiang, bring all the experts of the Dao World to the various parts of the world. Your mission is very simple: Save the dying and help the injured.
As for some natural disasters, if you can stop them, then stop them. If you can't, then save the people and living beings. "
Jiang Yu nodded. "I will do it now!"
After saying this, he turned and left.
Ye Xuan looked at Guan Yin. "Now that the Fifth Dimension has arrived, everyone in the world must be panicking. At this time, there will be people who will take advantage of the situation to create chaos. Send a team of experts to patrol the world. Anyone who takes advantage of the situation to create chaos will be killed!"
Guan Yin nodded. "Okay!"
Ye Xuan looked at Wen Zhaoruo. "Miss Wen, the Fifth Dimension needs the help of the Sixth Dimension!"
Wen Zhaoruo hurriedly said, "Young master Ye, please speak!"
Ever since Ye Xuan was willing to share the Dao Scripture, the Sixth Dimension had already followed Ye Xuan's lead.
The Dao Scripture!
It could change the fate of all the experts in the Sixth Dimension!
Ye Xuan said in a deep voice, "Right now, the Fifth Dimension definitely doesn't have enough manpower. I hope that the Sixth Dimension will send people down to help. Also, the Spiritual Energy of the Fifth Dimension is collapsing. We need some Heaven and Earth Spirit and Spirit Veins … Miss Wen, don't worry. I will only borrow them temporarily. After the Fifth Dimension stabilizes, I will return them all.
As for the problem of the Spiritual Energy of the Fifth Dimension, I will think of a way to solve it! "
Wen Zhaoruo hesitated before nodding. "Okay!
I will do it now! "
After saying this, she got up and left.
Ye Xuan looked at the abbot of the ancient temple. The current abbot of the ancient temple was also the leader of the Realm of Ultimate Bliss.
Seeing that Ye Xuan was looking at him, the abbot immediately got up and put his palms together. "Half a day ago, I summoned all the monks of the Realm of Ultimate Bliss to the Fifth Dimension. There are also some Spirit Veins and Heaven and Earth Spirit of the Realm of Ultimate Bliss. Now, they are all waiting outside for Young Master Ye's orders!"
Ye Xuan nodded slightly. "Thank you!"
The abbot of the ancient temple hurriedly said, "It's my duty!"
Ye Xuan nodded. He glanced at the crowd and said, "Everyone, now that the Fifth Dimension's calamity has arrived, the Fifth Dimension is facing unprecedented difficulties. In this critical period, I need everyone's help. Therefore, I hope that during this period, everyone can put away those thoughts in your hearts. Think what you should think, but don't think about what you shouldn't think, and don't do it.
Once this crisis is over, I, Ye Xuan, will not treat everyone unfairly! "
He knew that the reason the various powers of the Fifth Dimension were united was because of the Dao Scripture, as well as because they had a common enemy. But now, the Fifth Dimension's calamity had appeared, but it was suppressed by Mu Niannian's power. Everyone no longer felt a sense of crisis, and at this time, many people were starting to calculate some thoughts in their hearts!
Hearing Ye Xuan's words, the expressions of many people became somewhat unnatural!
At this time, Ye Xuan said, "Everyone has reached Release One. Some are true Release One, some are not … What I want to say is that everyone should set their sights further!"
After saying this, his right hand lightly pressed forward. In an instant, an invisible pressure suddenly enveloped everyone present!
At this moment, the expressions of everyone present changed!
Even A 'Jiu, Situ, and Aro!
Dao Validation Realm!
True Dao Validation Realm!
Ye Xuan looked at everyone, "I don't want to intimidate everyone, I just want to tell everyone that if I, Ye Xuan, can reach true Dao Validation Realm, everyone can as well. Of course, the premise is that everyone is an expert of my Fifth Dimension. Do you understand what I mean?"
At this time, an old man suddenly said with a trembling voice, "I understand, I understand!
This old man is a person of the Fifth Dimension, and when I die, I will be a ghost of the Fifth Dimension!
If anyone dares to harm the Fifth Dimension, this old man will be the first to not let them off! "
Countless people hurriedly expressed their opinions.
Ye Xuan looked at everyone present. He was very clear that the Fifth Dimension was very big, and it was not something that he, Ye Xuan, could manage alone. He needed the help of these people, but after these people cultivated to Release One, they would not care about the lives of others in this universe. In their hearts, their goal was to prove their Dao, to control their Dao …
Benefits!
He needed to use benefits to bind these people together, and then make them change the Fifth Dimension with him!
As long as there were enough benefits, even a bad person could become a good person.
And now, Ye Xuan's goal in life was to protect the Fifth Dimension and let it exist for generations to come …
Inside the hall, everyone was very excited.
Ye Xuan had reached Dao Validation Realm!
What did this mean?
It meant that these people also had a chance to reach Dao Validation Realm!
As for Ye Xuan, they still had a lot of trust in him, because when Ye Xuan said he would share the Dao Scripture, he would really share it!
Ye Xuan walked to the entrance of the hall, looked up at the end of the starry sky, and softly said, "Sister Nian … I really want to talk to you …"
Most of the time, the most regretful thing in life was not separation, but not being able to properly say goodbye …
...
PS: Asking for votes!









Chapter 1346
In the following period of time, Ye Xuan began to personally deal with the matters of the Five-Dimensional Universe.
Suppress the Five-Dimensional Calamity!
Although the Five-Dimensional Calamity had yet to erupt, the current situation of the Five-Dimensional Universe was still not good.
The various Heavenly Tribulations were secondary, because the current experts in the Fifth Dimension were enough to suppress these Heavenly Tribulations and various natural disasters. As for man-made disasters, the Fifth Dimension Alliance that Ye Xuan established also had the ability to suppress man-made disasters within the Fifth Dimension.
However, the collapse of Spiritual Qi was the biggest problem!
This was also a problem that Mu Niannian had not been able to solve!
Although Ye Xuan had borrowed Spirit Veins and all kinds of World Spirits from the Six-Dimensional Universe and the Dao World, compared to the collapse of Spiritual Qi in the Five-Dimensional Universe, it was really a drop in the bucket.
If this continued, even if the Five-Dimensional Universe survived, the Spiritual Qi would completely collapse and the Five-Dimensional Universe would become a dead planet!
In the clouds, Ye Xuan looked down at the world below.
At this moment, he finally understood to what extent the Five-Dimensional Universe was in a serious situation!
What should he do?
As if he had thought of something, Ye Xuan suddenly took out the box he had obtained from the Sword Sect.
Could this little fellow save the Five-Dimensional Universe?
There was no other way!
Ye Xuan opened the box.
Boom!
A wave of pure Spiritual Qi suddenly rushed out of the box. Soon, a small white claw stretched out of the box, followed by a small head.
A familiar face!
After the white little fellow crawled out, she blinked her eyes and then looked at Ye Xuan. Ye Xuan quickly took out a stick of candied hawthorn and handed it to the white little fellow.
Seeing the candied hawthorn, the white little fellow's eyes lit up. She took the candied hawthorn and licked it, then grinned at Ye Xuan.
At this time, Xiao Ling'er also appeared beside Ye Xuan.
Xiao Ling'er looked at the white little fellow and was very happy. She picked up the white little fellow and quickly said something.
The white little fellow was also very friendly towards Xiao Ling'er. She even plucked a candied hawthorn and gave it to Xiao Ling'er.
At this time, Ye Xuan suddenly said, "Can you do me a favor?"
The little white fellow looked at Ye Xuan, and Ye Xuan said softly, "Look at this world's Spiritual Qi … Can you help me recover?"
The little white guy looked around and shook his head.
Ye Xuan slowly clenched his fists. "Why?"
The little white fellow gently waved its little paw and the spiritual energy within a radius of tens of thousands of miles suddenly became dense. However, the spiritual energy soon began to dissipate at an extremely fast rate.
Ye Xuan understood.
If he wanted to restore the Spiritual Qi of this cosmos, he had to first resolve the Fifth Dimensional Tribulation of the Fifth Dimension. Otherwise, with the tribulation present, the Spiritual Qi would never be able to recover. This was because the Heavenly Tribulation and various natural disasters would continuously damage the Spiritual Qi and origin of the Fifth Dimension.
With this in mind, Ye Xuan looked at Xiao Ling'er and said, "You play with her!"
With that, he turned around and left.
In the following period of time, Ye Xuan began to lead the experts of the Fifth Dimension to suppress all kinds of natural disasters. If they could not be suppressed, they would be sealed.
For example, the volcanoes at the bottom of the sea had the strongest destructive power. If they could not be suppressed, then they would be directly erased. He currently had the strength to do so.
Under the concerted efforts of the Fifth Dimension, the Sixth Dimension, and the Dao World, the natural disasters in the Fifth Dimension became fewer and fewer.
However, during this process, Ye Xuan was also shocked.
This was because he discovered that if it were not for Mu Niannian's power suppressing them, they would not be able to resist the Fifth Dimension Tribulation!
Even he, Ye Xuan, would be helpless!
The entire Fifth Dimension!
How many volcanoes were there in the entire Fifth Dimension?
How many sea regions?
And the underground magma …
If it were not for Mu Niannian's power suppressing them, who could stop them if they erupted?
It was simply impossible to stop them. They could only escape!
However, Mu Niannian had used her power to suppress the entire Fifth Dimension. In other words, she had used her power to protect the Fifth Dimension.
At this moment, he thought of something that Mu Niannian had once said: As long as she did not want to die, it would be very difficult for her to die!
In addition, he also discovered that the situation in the Fifth Dimension was more serious than he had imagined.
The Spiritual Qi in all parts of the world was disappearing, and this disappearing Spiritual Qi would disappear forever.
Spiritual Qi was a very serious problem that the Fifth Dimension would face in the future.
....
In the starry sky, Ye Xuan found Ling 'er, who had always been by Mu Niannian's side.
Ling 'er's original name was Origin Spirit, and she was the spirit of the Fifth Dimension's Origin. Her current situation was very bad because the Fifth Dimension Tribulation had arrived, and she, the spirit of the Origin, was the one who had suffered the most.
Origin Spirit had always been by Mu Niannian's side and had never left.
Ye Xuan did not come alone. Instead, he had brought along the little white fellow and Xiao Ling 'er.
Ye Xuan brought the little white fellow to the front of Origin Spirit. Origin Spirit looked at the little white fellow with excitement and nervousness.
Ye Xuan suddenly looked at the little white fellow. "Can you help her?"
The little white fellow blinked and then nodded. She floated in front of Origin Spirit and pressed her right claw down on Origin Spirit. In an instant, endless purple gas enveloped Origin Spirit.
Boom!
A powerful aura suddenly swept out from Origin Spirit's body, causing the starry sky to tremble!
After a moment, the little white fellow retracted her little claw.
Origin Spirit opened her eyes and looked at the little white fellow. She said softly, "Thank you!"
The little white fellow grinned.
Ye Xuan hurriedly asked, "Have you broken through?"
Origin Spirit glanced at Ye Xuan and nodded. She seemed to have thought of something and turned to look at Mu Niannian's body in the distance. She said softly, "So, this is the opportunity she was talking about …"
In the past, Mu Niannian had asked her to follow Ye Xuan and said that there would be an opportunity in the future.
Obviously, this fortuitous encounter was the little white fellow.
Ye Xuan looked at Origin Spirit. "I need your help!"
Origin Spirit was the source of the Five-Dimensional Universe. If he had her help, it would be much easier for him to restore the Five-Dimensional Universe's Spiritual Qi!
After a moment of silence, Origin Spirit said, "She has no way to completely restore the Five-Dimensional Universe's Spiritual Qi!
This is because this is not her main body. It is just a small clone that she left behind. "
Ye Xuan glanced at the little white fellow. This little fellow was indeed just a clone. No, it was not even a clone. It could only be considered a small wisp of Spiritual Qi …
Ye Xuan suddenly said, "Can we steal Spiritual Qi from other places?"
Origin Spirit looked at Ye Xuan, and Ye Xuan said softly, "This should be possible, right?"
Origin Spirit said in a deep voice, "In theory, this is possible.
However, do you want to attack the Six-Dimensional Universe and the Dao World? "
Ye Xuan shook his head. "I am not that wicked!"
He definitely could not attack the Six-Dimensional Universe and the Dao World!
Origin Spirit said again, "There is another question. How can we steal Spiritual Qi?"
At this time, the little white fellow suddenly pointed at herself and waved her little claws quickly. She seemed very excited.
Xiao Ling 'er quickly translated, "She said she can!"
Ye Xuan was speechless.
Origin Spirit's expression was a little strange.
Why did this little fellow have the aura of a bandit?
Ye Xuan suddenly looked at the little white fellow. "Then let's go!"
The little white fellow nodded quickly.
Ye Xuan left with the little white fellow.
Behind him, Origin Spirit looked at Ye Xuan with a complicated expression.
....
Daoting.
At this time, the Daoting was shrouded in a shadow.
Ye Xuan had killed most of the Daoting Daoting, which was really a great shame for the entire Daoting.
In a dilapidated hall, the White Emperor's son sat quietly.
Now, all the affairs of the Daoting were under his control.
He was basically in charge of the internal affairs of the Daoting, while True Martial Divine Lord was in charge of the external affairs.
One of them was in charge of the external affairs, while the other was in charge of the internal affairs.
However, now that True Martial Divine Lord was fighting against the Dao Tomb in the Celestial Realm Abyss, he could only manage the affairs of Ye Xuan and the Five-Dimensional Universe.
In the hall, besides Bai Dizi, there were also some Daoting experts.
They were all people who had luckily escaped from Ye Xuan's butcher knife!
Bai Dizi suddenly looked at a Heaven General below. "Ye Xuan and the experts of the Five-Dimensional Universe are suppressing the calamity of the Five-Dimensional Universe?"
The Heaven General nodded. "Yes.
Not only that, but he also borrowed Spirit Veins and Spirit Qi from the Six-Dimensional Universe and the Dao World. However, it's not very useful! "
Bai Dizi chuckled. "The Fifth Dimension Calamity destroyed the origin of the Five-Dimensional Universe. How can the Spirit Qi recover before the calamity is over?
Moreover, even if the Fifth Dimension Calamity is completely suppressed, the Spirit Qi that disappeared can't come back!
At this time, if they want to save the Five-Dimensional Universe, there is only one way, and that is to get Spirit Qi from other places! "
At this point, his smile gradually widened. "Do you think he got Spirit Qi from the Six-Dimensional Universe or the Dao World?
These two are Ye Xuan's allies. "
Below, the Heaven General suddenly said, "Will he target our Daoting?"
Bai Dizi shook his head. "Absolutely impossible!
Because he doesn't have that ability!
My Daoting is very far from the Five-Dimensional Universe, so it's impossible for him to get Spirit Qi from us. Even if we give him Spirit Qi, he won't be able to move my Daoting Spirit Qi to the Five-Dimensional Universe!
His best method is to break the barrier between the Six-Dimensional Universe and the Five-Dimensional Universe, allowing the two universes to flow, allowing the Spirit Qi of the Six-Dimensional Universe to enter the Five-Dimensional Universe.
However, if he does that, the Six-Dimensional Universe will be out of luck!
Moreover, even if he does that, he won't be able to save the Five-Dimensional Universe. Right now, the Spirit Qi of the Five-Dimensional Universe has collapsed, so even a little bit of Spirit Qi is useless. "
At this point, he shook his head and smiled. "The Spirit Qi I Daoting Spirit Qi is enough. Moreover, it's pure and can supplement the Five-Dimensional Universe. However, Ye Xuan doesn't seem to have the ability to move my Daoting Spirit Qi to the Five-Dimensional Universe!"
Just as he finished speaking, a Heaven General suddenly rushed into the hall. That Heaven General said with a trembling voice, "Ye Xuan … He's here again!"
Ye Xuan had come!
Hearing this, the expressions of everyone in the hall changed drastically.
Bai Dizi suddenly disappeared from where he stood.
As soon as Ye Xuan appeared in front of the South Gate, Bai Dizi appeared in front of him.
Bai Dizi stared at Ye Xuan. At this time, Ye Xuan was in a normal state and hadn't gone crazy.
Bai Dizi's heart relaxed slightly. As long as he was rational, then he could talk. There would be flaws.
He was afraid of a crazy Ye Xuan who only wanted to kill people and didn't care about anything else!
The current Daoting really didn't want to face a crazy Ye Xuan, at least before the battle of the Two-World Abyss ended.
Bai Dizi looked at Ye Xuan. "Ye Xuan, do you want to kill people again?"
Ye Xuan shook his head. "I'm here to borrow something from Daoting!"
For him, there were only two things in his future life. Take good care of the Five-Dimensional Universe and destroy Daoting!
As for killing people, killing a few Daoting minions was meaningless!
His goal, Ye Xuan, was to destroy the entire Daoting!
Bai Dizi frowned. "Borrow something?"
Ye Xuan nodded. "The Five-Dimensional Universe lacks spiritual energy. I'm borrowing some from Daoting!"
Bai Dizi was stunned. Then, he smiled. "The spiritual energy here is pure. You can absorb it as much as you want?"
Ye Xuan looked at Bai Dizi. "Really?"
Bai Dizi nodded and smiled. "Absorb as much as you can!
Also, you don't need to borrow it. I'm giving it to you as a gift from Daoting! "
Ye Xuan said softly, "Then I won't stand on ceremony!"
Bai Dizi smiled. "Don't stand on ceremony. Quickly absorb!
Absorb as much as you can. "
There was an undisguised sarcasm in his voice.
At this time, a little white guy suddenly appeared beside Ye Xuan.
Ye Xuan looked at the little white guy. "Absorb!"
The little white guy grinned. She looked around and sniffed. In an instant …

Chapter 1347
When that little white fellow appeared beside Ye Xuan, Bai Dizi's expression changed instantly.
Because a sense of unease arose in his heart!
At this moment, he suddenly calmed down. This Ye Xuan did not seem to be a brainless person. Since he dared to come here, he must have something to rely on!
And at this moment, as that little white fellow inhaled, the surrounding spiritual energy disappeared in an instant!
Directly disappeared!
Not only was the surrounding spiritual energy gone, but even the spiritual energy of the entire 33 levels of heaven also surged towards that little white fellow at this moment!
This little white fellow was like a whirlpool at this moment. The entire Daoting's spiritual energy was gathering towards her!
Seeing this scene, Bai Dizi was stunned.
Very quickly, Bai Dizi reacted. He looked at Ye Xuan and said angrily, "Stop now!"
Ye Xuan spread out his hands. "You said it. Absorb as much as you want!"
Bai Dizi's expression was as ugly as if he had eaten feces. He glared at Ye Xuan. "I asked you to absorb, not her!"
Ye Xuan shrugged. "Her absorbing is equivalent to me absorbing!"
Bai Dizi stared at Ye Xuan.
Ye Xuan suddenly asked, "Has the battle of the Dual Realm Abyss ended?"
Bai Dizi looked at Ye Xuan. "If it ended, would you still be able to stand here?"
Ye Xuan chuckled and looked at that little white fellow. "Absorb more!
The spiritual energy here is very pure! "
That little white fellow nodded hurriedly and continued to absorb.
The entire Daoting's spiritual energy was disappearing at a speed visible to the naked eye!
Bai Dizi looked at that little white fellow. At this moment, he was extremely shocked. This little fellow was actually able to absorb so much spiritual energy?
The spiritual energy of the 33 levels of heaven was not an ordinary amount. But this little fellow actually absorbed all of it!
Absorbed all of it!
What kind of monster was this?
At this moment, many Daoting powerhouses suddenly appeared in the surroundings!
But no one dared to make a move!
They had experienced Ye Xuan's strength before. When this fellow went berserk, he was simply inhuman!
In the current Daoting, apart from the Dao Ancestor who was already in seclusion, no one could deal with Ye Xuan.
The White Emperor's son remained silent.
He felt very helpless!
He could only watch as Ye Xuan absorbed the Daoting Spiritual Qi!
The battle in the Two World Abyss was extremely dangerous. If the Two World Abyss was lost, the Daoting would forever be in a passive position. That would be a disaster for the Daoting. Therefore, the Daoting had mobilized almost all of their forces!
It was also because of this that Ye Xuan was able to act like a tyrant here.
Soon, all the Spiritual Qi in the Daoting was absorbed by the little white fellow!
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "Let's go!"
Hearing Ye Xuan's words, Bai Dizi heaved a sigh of relief.
Although the Spiritual Qi being absorbed was a little harmful to the Daoting, it was not serious because the Daoting Dragon Veins were still there!
There were 136 Dragon Veins in the Daoting. They were the true core of the Daoting Spiritual Qi!
At this moment, the little white fellow shook its head.
Not leaving?
Ye Xuan looked at the little white fellow. "What's wrong?"
The little white fellow pointed its little paw into the distance and waved it quickly.
Ye Xuan shook his head. "I don't understand!
Can you speak like a human? "
The little white fellow was speechless.
Ye Xuan was about to speak when the little white fellow suddenly waved its little paw. In an instant, a wave of Spiritual Qi floated out!
Seeing this, the White Emperor's son frowned. "What are you doing?"
Ye Xuan was also confused.
Soon, the wave of Spiritual Qi disappeared.
There was a moment of silence.
"Roar …"
Suddenly, a series of dragon roars resounded throughout the entire Dao Court!
Dragon Veins!
Seeing this, Bai Dizi's expression changed drastically. He stared at the little white fellow. "What are you doing?"
The little white fellow ignored Bai Dizi. She looked at the horizon. Soon, huge white dragons appeared in the surroundings!
At this moment, all the Dragon Veins in the Daoting left their positions and came to the sky above the Heavenly Gate. 136 Dragon Veins appeared above the Heavenly Gate. It was a magnificent sight!
Far away, Bai Dizi suddenly roared. "All Dragon Veins, return to your positions!"
The Dragon Veins glanced at Bai Dizi. They seemed to be slightly fearful!
At this moment, the little white fellow suddenly appeared in the sky. She looked at the White Dragons and harrumphed.
The White Dragons hurriedly lowered their heads!
The Spirit Ancestor!
The ancestor of all spirits in the world!
Although it was only a wave of Spiritual Qi, it was not something that the Dragon Veins dared to resist.
Seeing how docile the Dragon Veins were, Bai Dizi's face instantly turned pale.
At this moment, the little white fellow suddenly waved her little claw and turned to leave. The Dragon Veins hurriedly followed behind her.
Ye Xuan was stunned on the spot!
He did not expect that the little fellow could steal someone's Dragon Veins …
At this moment, Bai Dizi suddenly roared. "Stop them!"
He could let Ye Xuan absorb Spiritual Qi but he could not let the Dragon Veins leave with Ye Xuan. Because the Dragon Veins were the core of the Daoting Spiritual Qi. Once they left with Ye Xuan, it would be a huge blow to the Daoting!
At this moment, Ye Xuan suddenly turned to look at the Daoting experts. He had already unsheathed his sword.
The expressions of the experts from the Dao Palace instantly changed when they witnessed this scene!
Currently, besides the Daoting experts, no one was a match for Ye Xuan!
Although the Daoting experts had stopped, Ye Xuan did not stop. He suddenly slashed with his sword with his right hand.
Psst!
Tens of meters away, the heads of over 10 Daoting experts flew!
Seeing this, the Daoting experts' expressions changed and they retreated!
In the sky, Ye Xuan looked at Bai Dizi. "Thank you for the Daoting's gift!"
With that, he looked at the little white fellow. "Let's go!"
The little white fellow hesitated for a moment, and then she took out a stick of candied fruit and tossed it to Bai Dizi.
Bai Dizi looked at the little white fellow. "You … What do you mean by that?"
The little white fellow blinked and pointed at the candied fruit. Then, she pointed at the Dragon Veins in the sky.
Bai Dizi gulped. "You … You exchanged that candied fruit with me for those Dragon Veins?"
The little white fellow nodded hurriedly. She waved her claws a few times with a pained expression.
Bai Dizi looked at the little white fellow. "You're saying that you're making a loss?"
The little white fellow nodded.
Bai Dizi's face twitched. He stared at the little white fellow. His gaze could kill.
In the sky, Ye Xuan looked at Bai Dizi. "You can actually understand her beast language. You're really a talent!"
With that, he left with the little white fellow.
In the sky, the little white fellow seemed to be unwilling to give up. From time to time, she would look back at the candied fruit in Bai Dizi's hand …
In front of the Heavenly Gate, Bai Dizi looked at the candied fruit in his hand. His expression was extremely ugly.
This candied fruit was exchanged for 136 Dragon Veins. However, the little white fellow actually felt that it was a loss!
Was there any justice in this world?
Was there any law?
After a moment, Bai Dizi suddenly turned and left.
...
In the Fifth Dimension.
After Ye Xuan and the little white fellow returned to the Fifth Dimension, the little white fellow opened her mouth and spat. In an instant, the Spiritual Qi that she had absorbed from the Daoting surged out of her body. Soon, this Spiritual Qi began to spread throughout the Fifth Dimension.
At the same time, the little white fellow released the 136 Dragon Veins. When these 136 Dragon Veins appeared in this world, the Spiritual Qi in this world recovered at a speed visible to the naked eye.
The Dragon Veins were the core of the Spiritual Qi!
Previously, there was not a single Dragon Vein in the Fifth Dimension!
But now, there were 136 of them. Even the Sixth Dimension and the Dao World were somewhat envious!
Dragon Veins!
It could be said that among the Spiritual Veins, these Dragon Veins belonged to the top!
With the little white fellow, the Spiritual Qi, and the Spiritual Qi, the Fifth Dimension was rapidly recovering. However, the Heavenly Tribulation and various natural disasters had not completely disappeared. The Origin Spirit had not completely recovered either.
However, the problem was no longer big.
This was because those natural disasters could be suppressed by humans.
If it was in the past, even with the suppression of Mu Niannian's power, countless people would have died in the Fifth Dimension. This was because the Fifth Dimension had never been so united before!
The current Fifth Dimension was not only the most united in history, but it was also the most powerful in history. With so many people working together, the Fifth Dimension did not fall into chaos even though the natural disasters were unceasing!
As for the Origin Spirit, for now, it was still a bit difficult for it to completely recover.
....
However, no one knew that when the Spiritual Qi of the Fifth Dimension recovered, in the starry sky where Mu Niannian's main body was located, some strange special energy began to gather towards Mu Niannian's main body. However, this energy was very little …
.....
On this day, Ye Xuan came to the Sword Sect.
At this time, there were more than 280 Swordsman in the Sword Sect!
Over 200 Swordsman, and the weakest was at the Returnance Realm. As for Lu Yunxian, Gu Nian, and the others, they had reached the true Self Release Realm!
The current Sword Sect didn't just have Swordsman in the Fifth Dimension, it also had Swordsman from the Sixth Dimension and the entire Dao World!
Ye Xuan gathered all the Swordsman in the Sword Sect. He glanced at all the Swordsman and said, "All of you must reach the Self Release Realm!
Anyone who has reached the true Self Release Realm can come find me, and I will tell them what realm is above the Self Release Realm. "
The Swordsman were instantly excited when they heard this.
They knew that Ye Xuan's realm in the Sword Dao was above the Self Release Realm. Pursuing the peak of the Sword Dao was the dream of all Swordsman!
Meanwhile, Ye Xuan slowly closed his eyes. "Everyone, even though the Fifth Dimension has been suppressed by us, and the Fifth Dimension is slowly recovering its calm.
However, our true problem still hasn't been solved!
The Daoting won't give up!
I hope that the next time we face the Daoting, everyone can be by my side and attack together with me. "
Saying this, he glanced at all the Swordsman. "I will give you the best resources and the best conditions.
As long as you have the fucking ability, I, Ye Xuan, am willing to share all the Dao scriptures I have with you, as well as my experience in the Sword Dao. Anything I know, I am willing to share with you. "
Everyone was looking at Ye Xuan in that way.
Ye Xuan glanced at them. "The matter between us and the Daoting hasn't ended. The matter between us and them has just begun."
Saying this, he turned around and left.
In the distance, Ye Xuan's expression gradually became malevolent.
If he had been a bit stronger, if everyone in the Fifth Dimension had been a bit stronger, Sister Nian wouldn't have died!
Unfortunately, there were no ifs!
For him, there were only two things in his life:
The first was revenge.
If he didn't take revenge, he, Ye Xuan, would be a waste of his humanity!
The second was to protect.
To protect what Sister Nian wanted to protect!
As long as he, Ye Xuan, existed, the Fifth Dimension would always exist!
.....
PS: I have two things to do in my life. Asking for votes!
Asking for rewards!
Regardless of whether you give it or not, this is my request. This is my attitude!
If you don't like it, come and hit me!

Chapter 1348
Sword Sect!
Ever since Ye Xuan took over the Sword Sect, he began to spare no effort to nurture the Sword Sect.
These Swordsman, at present, were the strongest group in the Fifth Dimension besides Aro and the others.
However, compared to Daoting, they were still too weak!
These Swordsman must all reach Release One!
Only by reaching Release One could they barely contend against Daoting!
And it was not difficult for these Swordsman to reach Release One!
Ye Xuan not only gave them cultivation resources, but also shared Dao scriptures. Moreover, these Swordsman's talent was not low. Under such circumstances, it was only a matter of time before they reached Release One!
After leaving the Sword Sect, Ye Xuan found Ah Jiu and Situ.
In the bamboo house, Ye Xuan sat in front of the two women. He looked at Ah Jiu, "Senior Sister, I need you to stay!"
Ah Jiu picked up the wine gourd on the table and drained it in one gulp, "Sure!"
She really treated Ye Xuan as her Junior Brother. Although she knew that this Junior Brother might be fake, she still took it seriously.
At this moment, Situ asked, "Why?"
Ye Xuan did not say anything and got up to leave.
Situ looked at Ah Jiu, "What does he mean?"
Ah Jiu was expressionless, "He knows that you will stay!"
Situ was puzzled, "What makes him think that I will stay?"
Ah Jiu said softly, "If you wanted to leave, you would have left long ago!"
Situ was silent.
Ah Jiu said softly, "He has matured a lot … The him in the past was always laughing and joking … but now … I'm afraid that the him in the past will never come back!"
Situ seemed to have thought of something and sighed softly.
...
Three days later, Ye Xuan went to the Underworld.
Beside him were Wu Xin and San Sheng.
The Lord of the Underworld was dead, but the Underworld still existed!
On the way.
Wu Xin glanced at Ye Xuan, "Brother Ye, why do you want me to go to the underworld?"
Ye Xuan said softly, "You've been trapped in the underworld for 20,000 years. Don't you have any other thoughts?"
Hearing this, Wu Xin understood Ye Xuan's meaning.
At this time, Ye Xuan asked again, "May I know where Brother Wuxin is from?"
Wu Xin looked at Ye Xuan and said with a smile, "A rogue cultivator, really!"
Ye Xuan thought about it and said, "Why don't we stay in the Fifth Dimension?"
After being silent for a long time, Wu Xin said, "The Fifth Dimension is rich in Spiritual Qi and is indeed very suitable for living, but …"
At this point, he didn't continue.
Ye Xuan suddenly said, "I have four Dao scriptures, and there will be more!"
Wu Xin immediately sternly said, "Brother Ye, you're treating me like an outsider!
Did I stay in the Five Dimensions for the Dao Scripture?
No, I really think this place is very good!
In short, the Five Dimensions will be my home in the future. Even if I die, I will die in the Five Dimensions! "
At the side, Three Lives glanced at Wu Xin and said, "You're quite thick-skinned!"
Wu Xin: "…"
At this time, Ye Xuan suddenly said, "If you stay here, you will have to fight against the Daoting. Have you thought it through?"
Wu Xin said with a smile, "I understand!"
Ye Xuan nodded slightly and didn't say anything else.
What the Five Dimensions lacked the most was experts, and with the Dao Scripture, he could recruit many experts.
Half a year!
In this half a year, he had to strengthen the Five Dimensions and himself.
Before long, the three of them arrived at the underworld.
As soon as Ye Xuan arrived, the King of Hell appeared in front of him. King of Hell was about to speak when Ye Xuan suddenly slashed with his sword.
Chi!
King of Hell's head flew off, and at the same time, his soul was directly absorbed by the Soul Suppressing Sword!
At the sight of this, Wu Xin and Three Lives' expressions changed.
Wu Xin was shocked. This Ye Xuan's strength had reached such a level!
Killing a peak Dao Confirming expert with one sword strike!
Although he was restrained by the sword, this was still too terrifying!
At the side, Three Lives was shocked by Ye Xuan's actions. In her opinion, Ye Xuan's trip to the underworld was definitely to subdue it, but now it seemed that this was not the case.
Ye Xuan looked into the distance, opened his palm, and the Soul Suppressing Sword flew out. In the next moment, the entire underworld was filled with wailing!
The Soul Suppressing Sword madly absorbed the souls of the underworld!
At the sight of this, Wu Xin's expression became incomparably solemn.
Ye Xuan wanted to destroy the underworld!
In the distance, Ye Xuan's expression was calm, and there was only indifference in his eyes.
At this moment, Ah Yin and Nan Zang suddenly appeared in front of Ye Xuan. Ah Yin looked at Ye Xuan, "What are you going to do?"
Ye Xuan didn't speak, and the Soul Suppressing Sword in the distance was still madly absorbing the souls around it.
The current Soul Suppressing Sword was at the peak of Dao Confirming realm. It could even be said that it could fight against some Dao Controlling realm divine objects!
And in this underworld, the Soul Suppressing Sword could be said to be invincible!
Because it was too much of a bane to the soul!
Ah Yin stared at Ye Xuan, "You want to destroy the underworld!"
Ye Xuan looked at Ah Yin, "Is there a problem?"
Ah Yin said in a deep voice, "You can't do this!"
Ye Xuan asked with a smile, "Why?"
His smile was cold, and it made people shudder.
Ah Yin said in a deep voice, "Ye Xuan, there are many yin spirits in the underworld, if you …"
Ye Xuan suddenly slapped out.
Pa!
Ah Yin was directly slapped hundreds of meters away by Ye Xuan. He looked straight at Ah Yin and asked, "When the Lord of the Underworld helped Daoting destroy the Fifth Dimension, Miss Ah Yin, did you try to persuade the Lord of the Underworld?
You should know that there are many living beings in the Fifth Dimension! "
Ah Yin was silent.
Ye Xuan said again, "When the Lord of the Underworld went to destroy the Fifth Dimension, you didn't try to persuade him. Now, when I came to destroy the underworld, you came to persuade me, talking to me about the many yin spirits in the underworld … Don't you think your behavior is ridiculous?"
Ah Yin looked at Ye Xuan, "Can't you just let the underworld go?"
Ye Xuan suddenly said fiercely, "Can't the Lord of the Underworld let the Fifth Dimension go?"
Ah Yin was about to speak, but at this moment, Ye Xuan's Soul Suppressing Sword suddenly fell on top of Ah Yin's head. Seeing this, Ah Yin and San Sheng's expressions changed greatly!
Ye Xuan looked at Ah Yin, "San Sheng is my friend. I don't want to kill her friend and make her sad, so I won't kill you!"
Ah Yin's expression was a bit ugly.
At this moment, she suddenly remembered something!
That day, Mu Niannian plotted to make Ye Xuan return the favor he owed her …
If that favor hadn't been returned, she should be able to protect the underworld now!
Thinking of this, a bitter smile appeared on Ah Yin's face.
At this time, Ye Xuan waved his fingers, and Soul Suppressing Sword flew out again. Soon, Soul Suppressing Sword directly entered Fengdu City.
Absorb!
Soul Suppressing Sword was like a wolf in a flock of sheep in the underworld. Everything in the underworld was great nourishment for it.
On the side, Nan Zang didn't say anything.
Because he had already felt Ye Xuan's killing intent!
Ah Yin had San Sheng as a friend, but he didn't. He knew that if he opened his mouth, Ye Xuan would definitely kill!
Right now, Ye Xuan only wanted to kill!
Indeed, he could subdue the underworld, but he didn't want to!
Because Sister Nian was dead!
He wouldn't let anyone who was once his enemy go.
On the side, San Sheng walked to Ah Yin's side. Ah Yin looked at San Sheng with a pleading look in her eyes.
San Sheng shook her head.
She knew that Ye Xuan wouldn't let the underworld go. In fact, she didn't want to let the underworld go either. However, she didn't want to destroy the underworld. In the past, when she said she wanted to attack the underworld, she only wanted to kill the lord of the underworld and those experts.
And what Ye Xuan wanted to do now was to destroy the underworld!
At this time, Ye Xuan suddenly said, "That Dao Lord Qing Ming isn't in the underworld?"
On the side, Nan Zang put his palms together, "When he learned that Young Master Ye came to the underworld, he had already left."
He left!
Ye Xuan nodded slightly and disappeared. When he reappeared, he was already in the underworld's Fengdu City.
Ye Xuan began to frantically plunder all the treasures in the underworld!
What the Fifth Dimension lacked the most right now was resources. This was because he wanted to nurture a group of super experts!
And as a super power, how could the underworld lack treasures?
Before long, all the valuable treasures in the underworld were collected by Ye Xuan, including the Yellow Springs River.
What was worth mentioning was that he obtained 26 drops of Yellow Springs Holy Water!
These 26 drops of Yellow Springs Holy Water could greatly enhance a cultivator's soul. With these 26 drops of Yellow Springs Holy Water, the souls of Aro and the others would undergo a qualitative change!
As if thinking of something, Ye Xuan pointed with his finger, and a drop of Yellow Springs Holy Water landed in front of Wu Xin. Wu Xin blinked, "For me?"
Ye Xuan nodded.
Wu Xin hesitated for a moment, then said, "Brother Ye, aren't you afraid that I will take your benefits and leave?"
Ye Xuan shook his head, "You won't!"
Wu Xin was somewhat curious, "Why?"
Ye Xuan softly said, "If you were that kind of person, you wouldn't have been trapped in the underworld for 20,000 years!"
Wu Xin was stunned for a moment, then he laughed loudly.
Why was he trapped in the underworld for 20,000 years?
Because he didn't surrender!
If he had lowered his head back then, he would have immediately escaped!
But he didn't!
A person with such unyielding character would not do that kind of thing.
Wu Xin glanced at Ye Xuan, then said with a smile, "Brother Ye, I have received benefits from you. You can rest assured that I, Wu Xin, will live and die with the Fifth Dimension. I will do what I say!"
After saying that, he put away the Yellow Springs Holy Water.
In any case, he had nowhere to go now, so he might as well stay in the Fifth Dimension.
At least, this Brother Ye in front of him looked very good. He was to Wu Xin's liking!
About half an hour later, a powerful aura suddenly soared from Fengdu City.
Bang!
In an instant, a destructive aura of the soul swept through the sky above Fengdu City, and it was so strong that it caused the expressions of everyone here to change!
Even Ye Xuan was the same. Because he actually sensed danger at this moment!
His soul sensed danger!
As for the spirit of the underworld, A 'Yin's body had even started trembling!
Her eyes were filled with fear as she gazed at Fengdu City.
Ye Xuan gazed up at the sky above Fengdu City. A black vortex of the soul had suddenly appeared there, and then an extremely terrifying aura of the soul swept out from within the vortex. The aura grew stronger and stronger, and it suddenly underwent a qualitative change after around 15 minutes passed.
Bang!
The heavens and the earth trembled!
The Dao Control Realm!
The expressions of everyone in the surroundings had changed!
The Soul Suppressing Sword has actually advanced from the peak of the Dao Verification Realm to the Dao Control Realm?
Can you believe that a sword has attained the Dao Control Realm?
Moreover, its master is at the Dao Verification Realm!
Will this sword still acknowledge Ye Xuan as its master?
Meanwhile, a woman walked out slowly from within the black vortex. She seemed to be around 16 or 17 years old, wore a black dress, and had pitch black pupils.
At the instant she appeared, A 'Yin's body trembled even more violently!
Nan Zang's expression had become quite unsightly as well. Because he felt fear from within his soul!
Nan Zang gazed at Ye Xuan. Will Ye Xuan be able to subdue this sword?
Right at this moment, the woman walked over to Ye Xuan, and then she suddenly hugged Ye Xuan and spoke excitedly, "Young Master!
I'm at the Dao Control Realm! "
All of them were speechless.

Chapter 1349
This woman was, of course, Little Soul!
Hearing Little Soul's words, a rare smile appeared on Ye Xuan's calm face.
He was only happy that Little Soul had reached the Dao Defense Realm.
He didn't think of Little Soul as a sword, but as his sister.
And Little Soul had never thought of betraying Ye Xuan!
She had reached the Dao Defense Realm, but in her heart, Ye Xuan would always be her master.
Along the way, if not for Ye Xuan, she would never have reached this step. Most importantly, Ye Xuan treated her as family, and she also treated Ye Xuan as family.
The relationship between the two was not that of a sword and its master, but more like that of a brother and a sister.
Ye Xuan gently rubbed Little Soul's hair and said softly, "You are now at the Dao Defense Realm!"
Little Soul smiled proudly, "Young Master, I am very, very powerful now!"
Ye Xuan nodded slightly, "Little Soul, take care of me in the future!"
Little Soul grinned, "Young Master, I still have to absorb the power of those souls. If you want to fight, call me at any time!
I can fight many now! "
Ye Xuan smiled slightly, "Okay!"
Little Soul hugged Ye Xuan again, and then she returned to the Prison Pagoda.
Ye Xuan looked around. At this time, the Nether Realm was unusually quiet.
Because all the souls had been absorbed by the Soul Suppressing Sword!
In fact, he was not surprised that Little Soul could reach the Dao Defense Realm.
When he was Daoting, he slaughtered countless Daoting powerhouses, and every time he killed, the Soul Suppressing Sword would absorb their souls. Now, it had absorbed the souls of the entire Nether Realm …
Dao Defense Realm!
Now with the Soul Suppressing Sword, it was not too easy to kill ordinary Dao Defense powerhouses, but it would not be too difficult either.
Of course, this was far from enough for him.
Ye Xuan collected his thoughts and looked at Ah Yin, "Where are the other two Dao scriptures?"
He remembered that there were two Dao Scriptures in the Underworld, and the real reason he came to the Underworld this time was for these Dao Scriptures!
Yin said in a low voice, "There is a Daoist scripture on the Lord of the Underworld, but he has already been killed!"
Ye Xuan frowned. Meanwhile, Nan Zang spoke abruptly, "That scripture has fallen into the hands of the Daoting!"
Ye Xuan looked at Nanzang, and Nanzang said softly, "The Lord of the Underworld had already given the Dao Scripture to Daoting many years ago. As far as I know, he used that Dao Scripture to make a deal with Daoting!"
Ye Xuan asked, "If the scripture is so precious, why would he be willing to exchange it with the Daoting?"
Nanzang shook his head. "It's precisely because it's so precious that he had no choice but to exchange it.
That Dao Scripture is very important to Daoting. The Lord of the Underworld was also forced to give it to Daoting! "
In the hands of Daoting!
In other words, it was very likely to be in the hands of the Dao Ancestor!
Ye Xuan was silent for a moment, then asked again, "What about the other one?"
Yin said in a low voice, "The eighteenth level of hell!"
The eighteenth level of hell!
The Dao Breaker!
Ye Xuan was silent.
He remembered that Mu Niannian had said that Sister Nian had originally wanted to kill the Dao Breaker, and the reason why Sister Nian had this thought was probably because of the Dao Scripture!
Because Sister Nian knew that he would continue to search for the Dao Scripture, and that the mysterious expert in the eighteenth level of hell could pose a threat to him, so Sister Nian had wanted to kill the Dao Breaker, but she had given up!
Thinking of this, Ye Xuan suddenly said, "San Sheng, Wu Xin, you two stay here, I will go to the eighteenth level of hell!"
Hearing this, San Sheng's expression changed, "That place is very dangerous!"
Ye Xuan said softly, "Sister Nian did not kill the Dao Breaker!"
With that, he disappeared on the spot.
Next to him, Yin looked at San Sheng, "What does he mean?"
San Sheng said in a low voice, "Mu Niannian … that woman is meticulous, since she did not kill the Dao Breaker in the eighteenth level of hell, it means that the Dao Breaker is not a threat to her."
Ah Yin frowned, "Just because of this?"
San Sheng nodded.
Ah Yin was speechless.
....
Ye Xuan came to hell, this hell had a total of eighteen levels, each more terrifying than the one before.
And each level imprisoned some evil spirits that had committed evil in life, and these evil spirits had to be tortured here.
After a while, Ye Xuan came to the eighteenth level.
The eighteenth level of hell was very cold and bleak.
Ye Xuan saw a man, the man was chained by four pitch-black iron chains, below him was a burning flame.
Nine Nether Divine Fire!
Specialized in burning souls!
However, this man's strength was too strong, the power of the Nine Nether Divine Fire could make him feel pain, but it could not burn him to death.
Ye Xuan looked at the man, the man did not have any aura, he looked like an ordinary person.
Dao Breaker!
Ye Xuan walked towards the man, at this time, the man suddenly looked up, Ye Xuan frowned, because at this moment, he found that the man did not have eyes!
The man suddenly said hoarsely, "Scram!"
Ye Xuan opened his palm, in his hand was the Tendo Sword!
Sister Nian's sword!
At this time, the man frowned, "That woman's aura …"
Obviously, he was talking about Mu Niannian.
Ye Xuan nodded, "Yes."
After a moment of silence, the man said, "She asked you to come?"
Ye Xuan asked, "Did she say anything when she came here?"
The man said, "She wanted to kill me!"
Ye Xuan, "…"
The man said again, "But, she gave up."
Ye Xuan asked, "Why?"
The man did not answer.
Ye Xuan said softly, "I came here for the Dao Scripture!"
The man suddenly laughed.
Ye Xuan asked, "Why are you laughing, senior?"
The man chuckled, "You have already walked your own path, why do you need to cling to the Dao Scripture?"
Ye Xuan shook his head, "My own path is a path, the path of others is also a path, there are countless paths to the Grand Dao, there is no need to cling to one"
The man was silent.
Ye Xuan asked again, "Can senior give it to me?"
The man said, "Yes!"
Saying so, a black ancient scroll suddenly floated in front of Ye Xuan.
Ye Xuan put the Dao Scripture away, "Thank you, farewell!"
Saying so, he turned around and left.
At this time, the man suddenly said, "She has fallen.
Is that right? "
Ye Xuan stopped and nodded.
The man said, "I admire her very much, not just because of her strength."
Ye Xuan suddenly said, "Senior, I hope you won't be angry if I say a few more words!"
The man said, "What are you trying to say?"
Ye Xuan turned around to look at the man, "Since senior imprisoned yourself here, you must have done something that you regret, right?"
The man was silent.
Ye Xuan continued, "I also did something that I regret for the rest of my life, but I will not imprison myself, because that is hiding.
A man can be wrong, but he cannot hide, because a wrong is a wrong!
And hiding, with all due respect, is the behavior of a coward "
The man did not get angry, he only said softly, "You have no idea what I did!
I killed the love of my life, do you understand? "
Ye Xuan asked, "Why did you kill her?"
The man's body suddenly trembled, "Do you know what realm is above Imperial Dao?"
Ye Xuan shook his head.
The man said, "Above Imperial Dao is achieving the Dao!
The so-called achieving the Dao is to become the Dao, the 3,000 Grand Daos, one of these Grand Daos … and there are many ways to achieve the Dao!
In the end, I chose to become heartless!
Because being heartless is equivalent to giving up, and there is nothing simpler than giving up in this world.
Thus, I gave up on everyone around me, including the woman I love the most … I told her that after I achieve the Dao, I will come and get you … Do you know?
That woman foolishly waited for me for over a thousand years, and in the end, she became a skeleton … "
Ye Xuan suddenly said, "Animal!"
The man laughed loudly, "Well scolded, well scolded, I am an animal, an out-and-out animal"
Ye Xuan asked, "You didn't succeed?"
The man shook his head, "I didn't succeed!"
Ye Xuan asked again, "Why?"
The man suddenly laughed, "Because I can't forget her, I can't be truly heartless, but I abandoned her because I achieved the Dao … Isn't it ironic?"
Ye Xuan was silent.
The man was still laughing, but as he laughed, he started crying, "I didn't regret not achieving the Dao, I regretted giving her that promise … If I didn't give her that promise, if I didn't give her that hope, she might not have waited for me like that!
But, I really, really didn't think that she would take my promise seriously!
That silly woman, how can a man's promise be trusted? "
Ye Xuan shook his head, "She loves you, so even if she knew that what you said might be false, she still chose to believe it.
Perhaps this is love!
Even if I see you lying through your teeth, I still choose to believe it! "
The man was still laughing, his laughter was very sad, "Yes, she chose to believe me, but I am not worthy of her trust.
After she died, I could achieve the Dao!
Because at that time, there would be nothing in this world worth thinking about!
I could achieve true desirelessness, only the Dao in my heart … However, at that time, I realized that even if I achieved the Dao, what was the point?
It was meaningless!
Everything was meaningless! "
Ye Xuan was silent.
It had to be said that he was quite shocked. The person in front of him could achieve the Dao at any time!
But now, the other party had imprisoned him here, unable to forgive him.
Ye Xuan sighed softly, "Senior, do you think that the woman you love really loves you?"
The man looked at Ye Xuan, and Ye Xuan said softly, "She loves you so much, just think about it, would she really be willing to see you torment yourself like this?
In my opinion, she definitely wouldn't, or rather, if she saw you torturing yourself like this, how sad would she be?
I can understand that you can't forgive yourself, but what you're doing now is still meaningless.
Either you live well, or you die. "
The man was silent.
Ye Xuan was about to speak, but the man suddenly said, "You're right, she definitely wouldn't want to see me like this, since that's the case …"
As he spoke, his body suddenly started to disappear at a speed visible to the naked eye.
Seeing this, Ye Xuan's expression changed greatly. Damn, this guy chose to die …
Did he say something wrong?

Chapter 1350
Seeing the man's body becoming more and more illusory, Ye Xuan hurriedly said, "Senior, you …"
The man suddenly chuckled, "This is my choice!"
Ye Xuan solemnly said, "Senior, why don't you choose to live on?"
The man smiled, "Because it is meaningless!"
Ye Xuan was silent for a moment, then said, "I understand, Senior!"
The man laughed, "Thank you!"
Ye Xuan slightly bowed to the man, then turned and left.
At this time, the man suddenly said, "Young man, remember, if you don't have the ability, don't make promises to others!"
Ye Xuan nodded, "I understand!"
After saying that, he disappeared into the distance.
Behind him, the man's body became more and more illusory, until he completely disappeared.
No one knew that one of the most powerful beings in the world had disappeared without a trace just like that.
Achieving Dao!
Even in the Daoting, there were only a few of them!
...
At the exit of hell.
Ye Xuan quietly sighed.
In fact, his heart was a little complicated. He wanted to enlighten that senior, but he did not expect that he would say that person dead!
Although this was the other person's choice, it was also related to him!
However, if he was given another chance, he would still do the same!
If that man continued to live like this, he would rather die!
Ye Xuan lightly patted his mouth, "Looks like I have to be careful with my words in the future!"
After saying that, he disappeared.
Ye Xuan left the nether world with Three Lives and Wu Xin. This time, he not only took a Dao Scripture with him, but also all the treasures of the nether world!
After returning to the Fifth Dimension, Ye Xuan immediately gave those treasures to Guan Yin!
He only had one request, to focus on nurturing Aro and the others, as well as the Sword Sect's Swordsman!
...
In the courtyard, Ye Xuan and Ye Zhiming sat facing each other.
In front of them was the Dao Scripture.
Volume 5: Grand Dao.
Ye Xuan looked at Ye Zhiming. Ye Zhiming opened the Dao Scripture and softly recited, "Dao begets one, one begets two, two begets three, three begets all things.
All living things bear the Yin and embrace the Yang, and the Qi is harmonious … "
Moments later, she looked at Ye Xuan. "The core of this Dao scripture is the Great Dao!
If you know, you will act accordingly. If you do well, you will understand. If you understand, you will defend … "
She then passed the Dao Scripture to Ye Xuan. "This scroll can help you reach the Dao Defense Realm!"
Ye Xuan did not look at it. Instead, he passed the Dao scripture to Ye Zhiming, "I've just reached the Confirming Dao stage and it's not suitable for me to advance to the Imperial Dao. Help me look at the Dao scripture martial arts in this scroll!"
Ye Zhiming nodded. "Alright!"
She picked up the Dao scripture and carefully looked at it. After a long time, she looked at Ye Xuan. "The martial name of this Dao scripture is Dao Fist!
In the name of the Great Dao, transform the Great Dao into a fist, and one fist is the Great Dao. "
Ye Xuan asked softly, "Is it powerful?"
Ye Zhiming nodded. "It's at least twice as good as seeking death!"
She then looked at Ye Xuan. "There are nine scrolls in the Dao scripture, and the martial arts in the last five scrolls are stronger than the previous ones.
It's a pity that you didn't get the sixth scroll. Otherwise, you could cultivate the legendary Dao Scripture Body Tempering Art! "
Ye Xuan looked at the Dao scripture. "Slowly!
One day, we will collect all the Dao scriptures! "
Ye Zhiming sighed softly.
The remaining Dao scriptures were either in the hands of the Daoting or the Dao Tomb. It would be harder than ascending to the heavens to obtain the remaining Dao scriptures!
Ye Xuan suddenly said, "We can do it!"
Ye Zhiming looked at Ye Xuan and said softly, "Alright!"
Ye Xuan said, "I'm going into seclusion!"
Ye Zhiming said, "I'll go with you!"
Ye Xuan nodded. "Alright!"
In the following time, Ye Xuan went into seclusion to cultivate the Dao Fist!
Dao Fist!
Dao as a fist!
What is the Great Dao?
Dao without form!
It had to be said that cultivating this Dao Fist was extraordinarily difficult. This was because this Dao Fist was not for Dao Validation Realm cultivators to cultivate, but for Dao Defense Realm cultivators to cultivate!
Because only Dao Defense Realm cultivators had a clear understanding of the Great Dao!
Fortunately, with Ye Zhiming's help, even though it was still difficult to cultivate, it wasn't impossible!
During the time Ye Xuan went into seclusion, the Fifth Dimension became better and better!
The main thing was unity!
The current Fifth Dimension was too united!
Everyone was working hard for the same goal!
Coupled with the little white guy and the spiritual veins, the recovery speed of the Fifth Dimension after the calamity could only be described as terrifying.
The overall strength of the Fifth Dimension was also improving quickly, especially the Sword Sect. Almost every day, there would be a Swordsman reaching the Self Release Realm!
Everyone was fighting with their lives!
Not for Ye Xuan, not for the Fifth Dimension, but for themselves!
In the past, there was no path, and many people reached the end of the road. But now, some people gave them a path. As long as they had the ability, they could continue walking!
Therefore, everyone was fighting with their lives on the line.
Many times, unity was actually maintained by benefits.
Ye Xuan was not a saint. He did not think that he had the charisma to make these experts in the Fifth Dimension risk their lives for him.
What he could do was to use benefits to bind these people together and make them change!
As long as the benefits were enough, these people would change!
As for internal conflicts, although there were some, they were still within the scope of control.
Daoting was also paying attention to the situation in the Fifth Dimension.
Daoting, in a dilapidated hall.
Bai Dizi sat quietly. In front of him stood an old man who was constantly reporting the situation in the Fifth Dimension to him.
After a long time, Bai Dizi slowly closed his eyes. "Big trouble!"
Big trouble!
Now, Daoting not only had a big enemy in the Dao Tomb, but also a big trouble in the form of Ye Xuan!
This was not a good thing for Daoting!
Below, the old man said in a deep voice, "Although Ye Xuan is the only one who has reached Dao Validation in the Fifth Dimension, there is a group of people, such as Aro and the others. These people have a high chance of reaching Dao Validation!
Moreover, there are more and more Self Release Realm experts in the Fifth Dimension!
We must think of a way to restrain them. Otherwise, these people will become a big enemy of Daoting in the future. "
Bai Dizi suddenly said, "How is the situation in the Two Realms Abyss?"
The old man's face became serious. "It is still a stalemate. We have already lost three Divine Monarchs!"
Three Divine Monarchs!
Hearing this, Bai Dizi's face also became serious.
Every Divine Monarch was a peak Dao Defense Realm expert. One could imagine how fierce the battle was with three of them dying!
The old man said in a deep voice, "The situation over there is also very serious. Even True Martial Monarch has personally taken action.
As for the Fifth Dimension … we must think of a way to destroy them!
Otherwise, it will not be so easy for us to destroy them in the future. "
Bai Dizi stood up and walked to the entrance of the hall. He looked into the distance and saw a mess!
These were all left behind by Ye Xuan!
Ye Xuan!
At this moment, he thought of the madman Ye Xuan!
That person had killed a Heavenly King and a Divine General. Moreover, Ye Xuan was only at the Self Release Realm at that time!
But now, Ye Xuan had reached the Dao Validation Realm. What if Ye Xuan reached the Dao Defense Realm?
Bai Dizi slowly closed his eyes.
Ye Xuan at the Dao Defense Realm!
How terrifying would that be?
The Dao Tomb was a great danger, and so was Ye Xuan!
After a long time, Bai Dizi suddenly said, "You guys stay here. I will go to the abyss!"
After saying this, he disappeared.
....
In the Fifth Dimension.
After five days of seclusion, Ye Xuan left his room. He came to the starry sky and slowly clenched his right hand into a fist. There was not the slightest energy fluctuation in his fist!
After a moment of silence, Ye Xuan suddenly threw a punch!
Boom!
In an instant, the starry sky in the distance suddenly became dead silent.
His punch forcibly erased that piece of starry sky!
Dao Fist!
The Dao Fist contained the Great Dao!
The power of this punch was enough to easily destroy a peak Dao Validation Realm expert. Even an ordinary Dao Defense Realm expert would not be able to withstand the power of this punch!
At this moment, Ye Zhiming suddenly appeared next to Ye Xuan. She said in a deep voice, "I received news that Daoting Emperor Bai Xing Jun went to the abyss!"
Ye Xuan frowned. "Daoting wants to rope in the abyss?"
Ye Zhiming nodded. "Yes!"
Ye Xuan looked at Ye Zhiming. "Will the abyss follow the Daoting?"
Ye Zhiming said in a deep voice, "If the Daoting is willing to help the abyss cleanse its sins, then the abyss will definitely be willing to follow the Daoting."
Ye Xuan looked at Ye Zhiming. "What do you think?"
Ye Zhiming was silent.
Ye Xuan said softly, "You don't want the abyss to follow the Daoting, right?"
Ye Zhiming nodded. "That is my home!"
Ye Xuan said softly, "Let's go to the abyss!"
Ye Zhiming looked at Ye Xuan. Ye Xuan said, "I will go with you."
Ye Zhiming was silent.
Ye Xuan said, "I will go with you. Tell the abyss not to join the Daoting!"
Ye Zhiming said in a deep voice, "What if they don't agree?"
Ye Xuan said softly, "Then I will destroy the abyss!"
Ye Zhiming: "…"
Ye Xuan and Ye Zhiming left the Fifth Dimension and headed for the abyss!
In the starry sky, Ye Xuan was flying on his sword.
Beside Ye Xuan was Ye Zhiming.
Ye Zhiming glanced at Ye Xuan. She discovered that ever since Mu Niannian died, Ye Xuan's personality had undergone an earth-shattering change!
Ye Xuan was no longer as jovial as before!
He was no longer as scheming as before!
The current Ye Xuan was much more ruthless than before. For example, destroying the underworld … If it was before, Ye Xuan would definitely have subdued the underworld and made it submit.
But now, Ye Xuan had directly destroyed all the spirits in the underworld!
Ye Zhiming sighed in her heart. She knew that the once frivolous Ye Xuan would not return anytime soon!
About two hours later, Ye Xuan and Ye Zhiming arrived in front of an abyss. The abyss was thousands of feet long and wide, surrounded by clouds and mist.
Ye Zhiming said softly, "This is the abyss!"
Ye Xuan nodded, "Let's go down!"
At this time, a man suddenly appeared in front of the two. When the man saw Ye Zhiming, he was stunned for a moment before laughing loudly, "Bitch, you actually dare to return, you …"
At this time, Ye Xuan suddenly appeared in front of the man. The next moment, his left hand grabbed the man's shoulder and his right hand stabbed the man's abdomen.
Chi!
Behind the man, blood splattered!
The man's eyes widened as he looked at Ye Xuan in disbelief, "You …"
Ye Xuan pulled out his sword and said softly, "Be more polite when you speak in your next life."
After saying that, he turned to Ye Zhiming, "You don't seem to be that popular in the abyss!"
Ye Zhiming nodded.
Ye Xuan walked in front of Ye Zhiming and held her hand as they walked down. "The abyss doesn't like you, but I do!"
Ye Zhiming was silent.
At this moment, she suddenly felt a sense of sorrow.
Her clansmen were inferior to outsiders!

Chapter 1351
Big Abyss.
Through his conversation with Ye Zhiming, Ye Xuan gained some understanding of Big Abyss.
Although Big Abyss's overall strength was not as strong as Daoting's, it was not weak either.
Most importantly, Big Abyss was the guardian of the Dao Scripture.
However, this identity did not bring them any glory. On the contrary, it became a shackle for them.
Sinners!
They were punished to this Dao Scripture Guardian because they had sinned!
The purpose of Big Abyss was very simple. It was to restore freedom.
However, this was very difficult.
In a wooden hall, two old men sat facing each other.
One of the old men was Bai Dizi.
The other old man was Big Abyss's current Abyss Master, Qiu Lin.
Qiu Lin looked at Bai Dizi. "What Star Lord said just now, is it true?"
Bai Dizi nodded. "Abyss Master Qiu, do you think there is a need for me to come here and play such a big joke with you?"
Qiu Lin was silent.
Bai Dizi looked at Qiu Lin. "As long as Big Abyss is willing to be with Daoting, I, Daoting, am willing to help Big Abyss remove the shackle on its body!
Abyss Master Qiu, you should understand that in all the heavens, only I, Daoting, have this ability! "
Abyss Master Qiu looked at Bai Dizi. "You want me, Big Abyss, to deal with Ye Xuan!"
Bai Dizi nodded. "Yes!"
Very frank!
Qiu Lin was silent.
The current Five-Dimensional Universe was not the Five-Dimensional Universe of the past. Moreover, he knew about Daoting and Dao Yi. This Ye Xuan was not easy to deal with!
Bai Dizi smiled and said, "I know that Your Excellency is a little afraid of Ye Xuan. However, Your Excellency should be clear that the reason why I, the Daoting, cannot kill Ye Xuan now is mainly because my Daoting army is in the Two Realms Abyss. If the battle in the Two Realms Abyss ends, then I, the Daoting, can destroy Ye Xuan with a flip of my hand.
However, it's precisely because of this that I, Daoting, have no way to deal with Ye Xuan. Therefore, I want to borrow Big Yuan's strength!
Although the overall strength of the Fifth Dimension is not bad, it has not fully matured yet. Now is the best time to destroy the Fifth Dimension! "
Qiu Lin looked at Bai Dizi. "Lord Taibai Jinxing, as far as I know, Ye Xuan charged into the Daoting alone and came out alive!"
Bai Dizi smiled. "Yes.
However, that's because my Daoting experts are all in the Two Realms Abyss. "
Qiu Lin was about to speak when an old man appeared in the wooden house. The old man said in a deep voice, "That girl Zhiming has brought Ye Xuan here!"
Ye Xuan!
Hearing this, Bai Dizi's eyelids twitched. This guy actually came!
Should he run away first?
Of course not!
If he ran away now, wouldn't that be equivalent to being afraid of Ye Xuan?
Not only would he lose face, but he would also lose Daoting's reputation!
Qiu Lin glanced at Lord Taibai Jinxing. Lord Taibai Jinxing's expression was calm.
Qiu Lin suddenly said, "Please!"
The current Ye Xuan was not an ordinary person. Big Yuan had no choice but to treat him with caution.
Soon, Ye Xuan and Ye Zhiming appeared in the Wood Hall.
When he saw Bai Dizi, Ye Zhiming's brows slightly furrowed.
Ye Xuan glanced at Bai Dizi. Bai Dizi smiled. "Young Master Ye, don't come …"
Ye Xuan suddenly drew his sword and slashed.
Chi!
A ray of sword light slashed straight at Bai Dizi!
Bai Dizi's eyelids twitched. Damn, why did this person directly attack?
Bai Dizi waved his right hand. A golden round shield suddenly appeared in front of him.
Boom!
The golden round shield directly shattered.
Bai Dizi looked at Ye Xuan. "Young Master Ye, although I Daoting and the Five-Dimensional Universe are opponents, we …"
Ye Xuan suddenly disappeared from the spot.
Bai Dizi's expression changed. His figure trembled and directly disappeared.
When he reappeared, he was already hundreds of thousands of miles away!
Ye Xuan was stunned.
Wasn't this guy running too fast?
Qiu Lin was also slightly stunned. This Emperor Bai ran away just like that?
Qiu Lin's expression became somewhat strange.
He actually ran away!
How were they going to negotiate?
At this time, Ye Zhiming suddenly looked at Qiu Lin. "Does Patriarch want to ally with Daoting?"
Qiu Lin looked at Ye Zhiming. "They can help us get rid of our punishment!"
Ye Zhiming was silent.
Daoting indeed had the ability to help Big Abyss get rid of its punishment!
Ye Zhiming looked at Ye Xuan. Ye Xuan suddenly said, "In that case, Big Abyss has chosen to ally with Daoting?"
Qiu Lin looked at Ye Xuan. "Young Master Ye, it's fine if you don't want us to ally with Daoting. As long as Young Master Ye is willing to hand over the Dao scriptures, I can guarantee to Young Master Ye that I, Big Abyss, will never ally with Daoting!"
Ye Xuan slowly closed his eyes. "Ye Zhiming, enter the pagoda."
After a moment of silence, Ye Zhiming entered the World Prison Pagoda.
Ye Xuan opened his palm, and the Soul Suppressing Sword appeared in his hand. Seeing this, Qiu Lin's expression changed. "You … what do you want to do?"
Ye Xuan looked at Qiu Lin. "Daoting is my enemy, and Big Abyss has chosen to ally with Daoting. It's clear that he wants to deal with me, Ye Xuan. Since that's the case, I choose to make the first move!"
Qiu Lin said angrily, "Ye Xuan, you dare!
This is Big Abyss, not the Fifth Dimension. If you … "
Ye Xuan suddenly said, "Is this place more dangerous than Daoting?"
Qiu Lin was speechless.
At this time, dozens of experts had gathered outside the Wood Hall. Among them, the weakest was at Self Release One.
Ye Xuan suddenly disappeared.
Numerous shrill cries resounded outside the Wood Hall.
Qiu Lin's expression changed drastically, and he charged out of the Wood Hall. There were already three corpses outside the Wood Hall!
These corpses were all the corpses of Dao Validation experts!
In just a few breaths of time, three Dao Validation experts had perished!
All the experts of Big Abyss were stunned.
Ye Xuan turned to look at Qiu Lin. "Not letting your Big Abyss follow Daoting is for your own good, not for my own good."
Qiu Lin stared fixedly at Ye Xuan.
At this time, Ye Zhiming appeared by Ye Xuan's side. Qiu Lin's expression instantly became ferocious. "What? Did you bring him to Big Abyss on purpose to show off?"
Ye Zhiming frowned slightly. At this time, Ye Xuan suddenly vanished on the spot.
In the distance, Qiu Lin's expression changed drastically. He suddenly clenched his right hand into a fist. In an instant, his fist was covered in ghastly white flames. In the next moment, he punched out!
Hiss!
A ray of light instantly tore through the flames, and then Qiu Lin's right arm flew into the air. In the next moment, a sword was pressed against the center of Qiu Lin's forehead.
Qiu Lin was stunned. I lost with a single move?
Ye Zhiming was about to speak when Ye Xuan suddenly slashed with his sword.
Hiss!
Qiu Lin's head flew into the air.
Blood sprayed!
The expressions of all the experts of the Big Abyss changed drastically, but no one dared to make a move.
That was an instant kill!
How terrifying is Ye Xuan's strength?
Ye Zhiming was stunned as well.
She hadn't expected that Ye Xuan would be able to kill Qiu Lin with a single strike!
When did this fellow become so ruthless?
This was really killing people at the slightest disagreement!
Ye Xuan suddenly gazed at Ye Zhiming, "You be the master of the Big Abyss!"
Everyone was stunned, and it didn't take long for the experts of the Big Abyss to look at Ye Zhiming with hostile expressions.
Ye Zhiming shook his head, "No!"
Ye Xuan suddenly took out five Dao Scriptures and looked at the experts of the Big Abyss, "I have five Dao Scriptures, and mine is Ye Zhiming's. If she becomes the master of the Big Abyss, I, Ye Xuan, will be the friend of the Big Abyss!"
The experts of the Big Abyss were silent.
At this time, an old man suddenly walked out and glanced at Ye Xuan, "I heard that you shared Dao Scriptures with the experts of the Fifth Dimension. Is that true?"
Ye Xuan said, "If not, why would there be so many Self Release Realm experts in the Fifth Dimension?"
The old man said in a deep voice, "You have five Dao Scriptures. Are you willing to share them with others?"
Ye Xuan said, "I am only willing to share them with my own people!"
The old man was silent for a moment, then looked at Ye Zhiming, "Girl, have you seen them?"
Ye Zhiming nodded.
The old man sighed, "This old man admires Young Master Ye's breadth of mind."
He looked at Ye Zhiming, "From now on, Ye Zhiming is the current master of the Big Abyss. Who objects?"
Object?
The experts of the Big Abyss looked at each other, but no one objected.
There was only one thought in the minds of the experts of the Big Abyss, Dao Scriptures!
Ye Xuan was really willing to share Dao Scriptures!
As for Qiu Lin, he had already been forgotten!
Ye Xuan looked at Ye Zhiming, "Congratulations, you are now the master of the Big Abyss."
Ye Zhiming was silent for a moment, then suddenly looked at the old man, "Uncle Li Yuan, all the experts of the Big Abyss will go to the Fifth Dimension."
Li Yuan was a little hesitant.
Ye Zhiming said, "Anyone who goes to the Fifth Dimension, as long as their realm and strength are sufficient, I can explain Dao Scriptures to them and help them break through!"
Before Li Yuan could speak, a Big Abyss expert quickly said, "I am willing to go!"
The experts of the Big Abyss also expressed their willingness to go to the Fifth Dimension!
Li Yuan did not speak, and Ye Zhiming was also looking at Li Yuan. Li Yuan was the great elder of the Big Abyss, a person of virtue and prestige in the Big Abyss. He could influence too many people.
Li Yuan suddenly looked at Ye Zhiming and transmitted his voice using Xuan Qi, "What level has this Young Master Ye reached?"
Ye Zhiming was silent for a moment, then transmitted his voice using Xuan Qi, "He can easily kill Dao Controlling Realm experts!"
Hearing this, Li Yuan slowly clenched his fists.
Easily kill Dao Controlling Realm experts!
Li Yuan suddenly said, "To the Fifth Dimension!"
To the Fifth Dimension!
Just like that, the Big Abyss joined the Fifth Dimension!
With the addition of the Big Abyss, the strength of the Fifth Dimension was unprecedentedly strong.
It could be said that the current mid-level strength of the Fifth Dimension was no less than that of Daoting, but the top Dao Controlling Realm experts were still no match for Daoting!
However, Ye Xuan also knew that this matter could not be rushed!
...
Daoting.
When learning that the Big Abyss had joined the Fifth Dimension, Bai Dizi's expression suddenly became extremely ugly.
He did not expect that Ye Xuan would directly kill Qiu Lin and then use the Dao Scripture to tempt the Big Abyss.
It had to be said that Ye Xuan was very resourceful!
Bai Dizi slowly closed his eyes. After a long time, he suddenly said, "We can't fight with the Dao Tomb anymore!"
After saying this, he stood up and left.
To the Two Worlds Abyss.
The people there still did not know how terrifying Ye Xuan had become …
...
After Ye Xuan returned to the Fifth Dimension with the experts of the Big Abyss, he came to the starry sky and sat not far away from Mu Niannian's main body, he slowly roasted the fish.
After a long time, Ye Xuan suddenly said, "Sister Nian, the Fifth Dimension is getting better and better.
But … you won't be able to see it! "
There was no response.
Ye Xuan continued, "The Fifth Dimension will get better and better. I will protect the Fifth Dimension, protect the sun, moon, and stars, protect this land …"
There was still no response.
After a long time of silence, Ye Xuan said softly, "Sister Nian, I want revenge!
I want to kill everyone in the Daoting … I will definitely do it … "
The starry sky was silent.
Ye Xuan looked up into the depths of the starry sky and said softly, "What is Bai Dizi thinking now?
He must be thinking about how to kill me.
Right now, there are no experts in the Daoting … There is only one way, and that is to stop the war with the Dao Tomb … Will they stop the war?
Under normal circumstances, they definitely won't, but what if the Daoting makes a concession? "
After saying this, he retracted his gaze and looked at the bonfire in front of him. "Right now, the overall strength of the Fifth Dimension is inferior to the Daoting. If they start a war with the Daoting, the Fifth Dimension will not be able to win … So, we can't let the Daoting stop the war with the Dao Tomb, but how can we make them continue to fight?"
After saying this, he looked at Mu Niannian. "If Sister Nian was here, what would you do?"
There was no response.
At this time, Guan Yin suddenly appeared next to Ye Xuan. Guan Yin said in a deep voice, "Someone from the Dao Tomb has come!"
Ye Xuan looked at Guan Yin. "The Dao Tomb?"
Guan Yin nodded. Her expression was a little strange.
Ye Xuan asked, "What's the matter?"
Guan Yin said, "They are here to propose marriage?"
Ye Xuan was stunned, then said, "Propose marriage?
What marriage? "
Guan Yin said in a deep voice, "The Dao Tomb wants you to marry their Goddess. Moreover, they want you to use the Dao Scripture as a dowry!"
Ye Xuan: "…"

Chapter 1352
In the starry sky, Ye Xuan's mind was in a mess.
Marrying the Dao Burial Mound's Goddess?
"Marry?"
Ye Xuan looked at Guan Yin, "Are you sure they used this word?"
Guan Yin nodded.
Ye Xuan softly said, "This Dao Burial Mound is interesting!"
Guan Yin said, "What do you think?"
Ye Xuan said, "Let's go and meet them!"
The two left.
Just as Ye Xuan entered the Sword Hall, a strange voice suddenly came, "Haha, worthy of being the Master of the Fifth Dimension, putting on airs, making us wait for so long …"
Ye Xuan looked over, the speaker was a young man wearing a brocade robe, holding a sword in his hand.
Beside the man was an old man. The old man wore a plain robe and looked very scholarly.
Dao Burial Mound!
Ye Xuan walked in front of the two, the old man stood up and cupped his fists towards Ye Xuan, "This old man is Zhu Jianshen, greeting Young Master Ye!"
Ye Xuan smiled, "Old Zhu, please sit!"
Zhu Jianshen nodded, "Young Master Ye, please!"
The two sat down.
At this time, the young man suddenly sneered, "Young Master Ye is really arrogant, making us wait for so long!"
Zhu Jianshen picked up the teacup beside him, not saying anything.
Ye Xuan looked at the young man, "You are?"
The young man sneered, "Dao Burial Mound, Helian Jian, the young generation's number one Swordsman!"
Ye Xuan looked at Zhu Jianshen, the latter smiled bitterly, "Young Master Ye, Young Master Helian is also here under orders!"
Obviously, he couldn't do anything about it!
Ye Xuan smiled, then said, "Previously, my friend told me that you want me to marry into the Dao Burial Mound, and that you want me to use the Dao Scripture as dowry?"
Zhu Jianshen was about to speak when Helian Jian suddenly said, "Do you have any questions?"
Ye Xuan looked at He Lianjian and said with a smile, "Shouldn't I have a problem?"
He Lianjian looked at Ye Xuan, "The reason why the Five-Dimensional Universe is still alive is because my Dao Tomb is restraining the Daoting. If not for my Dao Tomb, your Five-Dimensional Universe would have long since disappeared!"
Saying this, he sneered, "Do you really think that it was that Tendo from the Fifth Dimension who saved the Fifth Dimension?
No, it was my Dao Tomb that saved your Five-Dimensional Universe! "
Zhu Jianshen frowned slightly, but he still didn't say anything, nor did he stop Helian Jian.
Ye Xuan suddenly looked at Zhu Jianshen, smiling but not speaking.
He Lianjian frowned slightly when he saw this scene. "What do you mean?"
Ye Xuan laughed and said, "Young Master Helian, why don't you go out and calm down?"
He Lianjian's eyes narrowed, his left hand tightly gripping the sword in his hand. "Do you want to taste the sharpness of my sword?"
Ye Xuan chuckled and said, "Young Master Helian, I don't know who sent you here, but I know that the person who sent you definitely doesn't have good intentions!
The other party knows that you don't have a brain, yet you are still arrogant. There is only one explanation for sending you here, and that is that they want me to kill you.
I don't know if the other party simply wants me to kill you, or if they want me to have a conflict with the Dao Tomb, or if they want you to become enemies with me, Ye Xuan, or both! "
Saying this, he looked at Zhu Jianshen, "Your Excellency, am I right?"
Zhu Jianshen gave Ye Xuan a deep look, but didn't say anything.
He Lianjian's expression became somewhat ugly. "What do you mean?"
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "Think about it yourself!"
He Lianjian fell silent for a moment, and then he seemed to have thought of something, and his voice trembled as he said, "No … she didn't mean that … she definitely didn't mean that …"
Ye Xuan picked up the spirit tea at the side and took a light sip, and then he said, "Young Master Helian, you can calm down and think about it. Since you were able to come this far, you definitely aren't a brainless person. Think about it carefully and you should be able to understand!"
He Lianjian gripped his sword tightly with his right hand while his expression was extremely unsightly.
Could it be that the other party really wants me to die?
Meanwhile, Ye Xuan looked at Zhu Jianshen, "Your Excellency, let's get down to business!"
Zhu Jianshen spoke in a light voice, "Hearing about her isn't as good as seeing her in person!"
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "My older sister told me that I have to think about everything I do in the future. She said that it's never wrong to be cautious!
Of course, the most important thing is that she's gone now!
I can't be willful anymore!
I don't have the qualifications to be willful anymore! "
Zhu Jianshen spoke in a light voice, "Miss Mu is an extraordinary person!"
As he spoke, he looked at Ye Xuan, "Young Master Ye, I'll get straight to the point!
We want to form a marriage alliance with Young Master Ye. "
Ye Xuan said, "You want the Dao Scripture!"
Zhu Jianshen said, "Everyone can accept the idea of a marriage alliance, what do you think?"
Ye Xuan asked with a smile, "What if I don't agree?"
Zhu Jianshen said calmly, "White Emperor Star Monarch has already arrived at the Heaven Realm Abyss, so we have a temporary truce.
Whether we fight or not, the initiative lies in the hands of my Dao Tomb. "
As he spoke, he looked at Ye Xuan, "Or should I say, in the hands of Young Master Ye!"
Ye Xuan was silent.
Zhu Jianshen slowly drank his tea, not in a hurry.
As for He Lianjian, he was still pondering, but his expression was becoming more and more unsightly.
He was almost blocked by someone else, how could his expression be good?
At this time, Ye Xuan suddenly said, "Who is that Goddess?"
Zhu Jianshen said, "Lord's adopted daughter, and also the current leader of my Dao Tomb. This time, I came under her orders."
Ye Xuan said with a smile, "She asked you to propose for me to marry her?"
Zhu Jianshen nodded, "Yes!"
Ye Xuan chuckled, "This is interesting."
A conspiracy!
He smelled a conspiracy!
His intuition told him that the other party did not only want the Dao Scripture, but also wanted something else!
What was it?
After thinking for a long time, Ye Xuan could not think of anything else besides the Dao Scripture that was worth the other party's attention!
Could it be that the other party coveted his beauty?
En, that must be it!
At this time, Zhu Jianshen suddenly said, "Young Master Ye, what do you think?"
Ye Xuan retracted his thoughts and asked, "What else did she say?"
Zhu Jianshen said, "The Goddess said that we can't force Young Master Ye. If Young Master Ye doesn't agree, it doesn't matter, we are still friends!"
Ye Xuan said, "But, you will make a temporary truce with the Daoting, right?"
Zhu Jianshen nodded.
Ye Xuan was silent.
Zhu Jianshen continued, "The Goddess also said that White Emperor Xingjun praised Young Master Ye to the point where he almost said that Young Master Ye is the number one evildoer since ancient times!
Now, the Daoting places great importance on Young Master Ye, very, very great importance! "
White Emperor Xingjun!
Ye Xuan was silent. He should have killed this old man back then, but he had no choice. Although that old man did not know how to fight, his escaping skills were too good!
Zhu Jianshen continued to drink his tea, he was not anxious at all.
Right now, the initiative was in the hands of the Dao Tomb!
The one who should be anxious was Ye Xuan!
Because once the Dao Tomb retreated, the Daoting would definitely destroy the Fifth Dimension at all costs.
What Ye Xuan had done in the Daoting was a great humiliation to the entire Daoting!
Not only had he slaughtered the Daoting, but he had also tricked the Daoting's Spirit Vein!
Not only did he kill people, but he also destroyed their hearts!
Right at this moment, Ye Xuan suddenly said, "Your Excellency, may I ask if your Divine Daughter wants the Dao Scripture, or is it that her true objective is actually to kill me?"
Zhu Jianshen almost spat out the tea in his mouth. Although he didn't, he still choked.
Zhu Jianshen looked at Ye Xuan with a strange expression, "Young master Ye … this old man doesn't know how to answer you!"
Ye Xuan was speechless.
Zhu Jianshen put down the teacup and said, "Young Master Ye, have you considered it?"
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "I'll go with you to the Dao Tomb!"
Zhu Jianshen was stunned.
Ye Xuan chuckled and said, "Talking about marriage naturally requires two people to meet and discuss it. What do you think?"
Zhu Jianshen hesitated and said, "You want to go to the Dao Tomb?"
Ye Xuan nodded, "Yes.
Also, I will bring the Dao Scripture with me! "
Zhu Jianshen looked at Ye Xuan, "Do you want to leave now?"
Ye Xuan said, "Give me half a day, is that okay?"
Zhu Jianshen nodded, "Okay!"
Ye Xuan got up and left. At this moment, Helian Jian suddenly said, "You are a Swordsman!"
Ye Xuan looked at Helian Jian, and Helian Jian looked at Ye Xuan, "Please enlighten me!"
Ye Xuan suddenly disappeared. The next moment, a sword was pressed against Helian Jian's eyebrows, and Helian Jian was petrified on the spot.
Ye Xuan put away his sword and smiled, "Young Master Helian, let's have a good spar another day."
After saying that, he turned and left.
In the same place, Helian Jian said with a trembling voice, "He is so strong …"
Thinking of this, he looked at Zhu Jianshen, "I treated him like that before, why didn't he kill me?"
Zhu Jianshen said softly, "Because Young Master Ye is a smart person … a really smart person!"
Helian Jian was silent.
....
Inside the hall.
Guan Yin said in a deep voice, "Do you really want to go to the Dao Tomb?"
Ye Xuan nodded, "I must go!
If I don't go, the Dao Tomb will stop, and I will fight to the death with the Daoting. "
Guan Yin said, "That woman proposed to marry you, her goal can't just be the Dao Scripture, right?"
Ye Xuan said softly, "There must be another goal, but I still haven't figured out what it is. However, as long as I go to the Dao Tomb, I will definitely find out!"
Guan Yin asked, "Will it be dangerous?"
Ye Xuan shook his head, "Everything is unknown!"
He remembered Mu Niannian said that the Dao Tomb cannot be trusted, and the people there, in a way, are more terrifying than the Daoting.
Guan Yin hesitated, then said, "Can't I not go?"
Ye Xuan said softly, "The Daoting and the Dao Tomb are both things I have to face!
Don't worry, I may not be able to gain an advantage, but I will definitely not suffer a loss! "
Guan Yin was puzzled, "Why?"
Ye Xuan patted his face lightly, "Because I am shameless!
How can a shameless person suffer a loss? "
Guan Yin was speechless, "…"
After settling the matter, Ye Xuan followed Zhu Jianshen and Ye Xuan to the Dao Tomb.
This time, he brought Ye Zhiming.
....
In the Dao Tomb.
On the peak of a mountain, a woman stood on an ancient tree. The woman wore a snow-white dress, her hands behind her back, and there was a heroic spirit between her brows.
At this time, the woman suddenly smiled, "Come to the Dao Tomb?
Interesting … "

Chapter 1353
Within the Dao Tomb.
Along the way, Ye Zhiming explained the Dao Tomb to Ye Xuan.
The Dao Tomb was a place where some Dao Breakers gathered. The purpose of these Dao Breakers gathering was simple: to fight against Daoting.
In the past, their goal had been very simple. They had only wanted to fight against the Daoting. But now, these Dao Breakers had become a force. Their goal wasn't just to destroy the Daoting!
As for the specific strength of the Dao Tomb, Ye Zhiming did not know. However, if the Dao Tomb could contend with the Daoting, then its strength was definitely not weaker than the Daoting.
Along the way, He Lianjian also became more low-key, and when he conversed with Ye Xuan, he was sufficiently courteous.
Power!
In any place, only those with strength would be respected.
He Lianjian wasn't stupid. If he still wanted to find trouble with Ye Xuan at this time, then he couldn't be called stupid!
Because that was an insult to the word 'stupid'.
Along the way, Zhu Jianshen rarely spoke.
...
After an unknown period of time, the three of them arrived at a starry sky. After passing through nearly a dozen spatial black holes, they finally arrived at the Dao Tomb.
The Dao Tomb was not mysterious at all. It was just a mountain range, and in the middle of the mountain range, there was a huge mountain called the Dao Tomb Mountain. This Dao Tomb Mountain was the base of the Dao Tomb.
Ye Xuan sensed many powerful auras as soon as he entered the Tomb of the Way.
There was no lack of Dao Defense Realm cultivators among them!
Of course, in this place, it should be called the Dao Breaking realm!
In Daoting, above Dao Corroboration was Dao Defense, and in the Dao Tomb, above Dao Corroboration was Dao Breaking.
Two completely different paths of cultivation!
Ye Xuan looked around and sensed the powerful auras around him. He knew that he still had a long way to go in the Fifth Dimension.
There were many Self Release Realm experts in the Fifth Dimension, but there were too few Dao Verification and Dao Controlling Realm experts!
The experts of these two realms could not be compared to the Dao Tomb and Daoting!
As for achieving the Dao above the Imperial Dao and Dao Breaking Dao, there was not a single one in the Fifth Dimension!
Meanwhile, Zhu Jianshen suddenly said, "Our people are at the Celestial Abyss right now!"
Ye Xuan glanced at Zhu Jianshen. He naturally understood Zhu Jianshen's meaning. Zhu Jianshen was telling him that the Dao Tomb was very powerful, very powerful!
Ye Xuan smiled and said nothing.
At this moment, a powerful aura suddenly came from the horizon. Ye Xuan looked up and saw a white-robed man appear above them.
Beside Ye Xuan, He Lianjian said in a low voice, "Brother Ye, this person is called Bai Shujing, and he's one of the Goddess's admirers. He's here to cause trouble!"
Ye Xuan looked at Helian Jian, "Brother Helian, what do you think I should do?"
He Lianjian thought for a moment and said, "Brother Ye, the strong are respected here, so you absolutely can't be afraid. If he dares to provoke you, then beat him up. Otherwise, everyone here will think that you're easy to bully, and all of them will come to bully you. At that time, you'll be in endless trouble!"
Ye Xuan cupped his fists. "I've benefited from your advice!"
At this time, Bai Shujing's gaze suddenly fell on Ye Xuan. "You're Ye Xuan?"
Ye Xuan nodded. "That's me!"
Bai Shujing sneered. "Why don't you take a piss and look at yourself? Are you worthy of the Dao Tomb's Goddess?"
Ye Xuan smiled. "If I'm not wrong, you should like the Goddess, but the Goddess doesn't like you. So, when you heard that the Goddess likes me, Ye Xuan, you became jealous and came to cause trouble for me, right?"
Bai Shujing was so angry that he started laughing. "The Goddess likes you?
Are you joking? "
Ye Xuan looked at Zhu Jianshen. "Senior Zhu, did the Goddess ask you to go to the Fifth Dimension to propose marriage?"
Zhu Jianshen nodded.
Ye Xuan looked at Bai Shujing and spread his hands. "You see, because I'm too outstanding, your Goddess admires me. So, she couldn't help but go to the Fifth Dimension to propose marriage!"
Zhu Jianshen hesitated for a moment before saying, "Young Master Ye, the Goddess …"
Ye Xuan blinked. "Could it be that she doesn't admire me?
Is it because of something else? "
Zhu Jianshen was speechless.
The Goddess's goal was naturally for the Dao Scripture, but it wasn't good to say this out loud!
Ye Xuan sighed in a low voice. "Sigh, actually, I'm also very troubled. She's too outstanding!
I tried to change this shortcoming for a long time, but I still couldn't get rid of it! "
Zhu Jianshen's mouth twitched. Was this guy's skin made of iron?
He Lianjian, who was at the side, was also dumbfounded. Wasn't Ye Xuan a little too thick-skinned?
At this time, Bai Shujing suddenly said angrily, "Do you still want face?"
Ye Xuan glanced at Bai Shujing. "Do you like the Goddess?"
Bai Shujing was speechless, not knowing how to reply.
Ye Xuan said with a smile, "You like the Goddess, but don't dare to say it. Why don't you dare to say it?
Because you feel inferior!
Think about it, your Goddess is so outstanding, so would she like someone with an inferiority complex? "
Bai Shujing's expression was extremely unsightly.
Ye Xuan continued, "I can see that you've reached the true Self Release Realm, so your mental state shouldn't be so bad. Why don't you even have the courage to admit it?
Loving a woman isn't something that can't be seen in the light.
Why should you feel inferior?
If your strength isn't enough, and you feel that you aren't worthy of her, then work hard to increase your strength. Tell me, do you think there's any meaning in making trouble for me?
Or would your Goddess be grateful to you for making trouble for me?
No, she would only look down on you even more! "
In the sky, Bai Shujing's expression became even more unsightly!
It was as if he'd choked on five kilograms of dung!
At this time, Ye Xuan continued, "If you were a woman, would you like a man who doesn't even have the courage to admit it?"
As he spoke, he gazed at Helian Jian. "Do you think what I said makes sense?"
Helian Jian hesitated for a moment, and then he said, "It does make sense!"
Ye Xuan gazed at Bai Shujing. "Think about it, if you were at the legendary Dao Control Realm right now, the number one genius of the Dao Tomb … At that time, would you still feel that you aren't worthy of the Goddess?"
Bai Shujing clenched his fists tightly as he gazed at Ye Xuan, and it was unknown what he was thinking.
Ye Xuan sighed softly. "Young man, as someone who's experienced it, I'll teach you a few moves!
There are only two ways to deal with women. The first is to possess formidable strength and subdue her. The second is to use shamelessness to pursue her! "
Helian Jian suddenly said in a light voice, "Brother Ye, can shamelessness really work?"
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "A brave woman is afraid of a clingy man!
So long as your skin is thick enough, then there's no woman you can't conquer! "
Helian Jian glanced at Ye Xuan, and he muttered in his heart. Is this fellow really a Swordsman?
Zhu Jianshen glanced at Ye Xuan, and he sighed softly. This fellow is too outrageous!
Can the Goddess deal with this fellow?
Don't suffer a double loss when the time comes!
Actually, he was really quite worried right now. Not only was this Young Master Ye's strength formidable!
His ability to deceive others was also rare in the world!
Most importantly, this Young Master Ye was truly shameless!
Meanwhile, Ye Xuan suddenly said, "Senior Zhu, let's go see the Goddess!"
Zhu Jianshen hesitated for a moment, and then he said, "Young Master Ye, please be more composed and don't be rude when you meet the Goddess!"
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "Don't worry, I won't act rashly!
I, Ye Xuan, am a pure person. Under normal circumstances, I wouldn't casually enter into relationships with women! "
Helian Jian was speechless.
Zhu Jianshen's face twitched. "Young Master Ye, that's not what I meant!"
Ye Xuan blinked. "Then what do you mean, Senior?"
Zhu Jianshen hesitated for a moment, and then he said, "Let's go see the Goddess!"
After he finished speaking, he turned around and left.
He was a little afraid of this Young Master Ye!
It was truly a headache!
Ye Xuan followed him.
Helian Jian glanced at Bai Shujing in the distance. Bai Shujing was still silent, and he seemed to be thinking about something.
Helian Jian patted his face and said softly, "Is being shameless really useful?"
....
In the distance, Ye Xuan was constantly sizing up his surroundings. During this time, powerful divine senses swept over him from time to time, but he didn't resist them. Those divine senses were unable to invade his body at all.
Zhu Jianshen didn't speak along the way, and whenever someone came to look for Ye Xuan, he would beat them away!
He finally understood what was going on!
Not many of the younger generation in the Dao Tomb were a match for Ye Xuan, and those who came to look for Ye Xuan were asking to be humiliated.
Soon, the two of them arrived at a large hall. At this time, Zhu Jianshen turned to look at Ye Xuan. "Young Master Ye, the Goddess is currently discussing something with the others. Please wait for a moment!"
Ye Xuan nodded. "Alright!"
Zhu Jianshen nodded slightly, and then he stood to the side and closed his eyes to rest.
Ye Xuan looked around, and then he slowly closed his eyes.
At this time, Ye Zhiming's voice suddenly sounded in his mind. "There is also a Dao Scripture in this Dao Tomb!"
Ye Xuan asked, "Can you sense the whereabouts of that Dao Scripture?"
Ye Zhiming said in a low voice, "I can only sense its aura, but not its exact location!"
Ye Xuan fell silent.
At this time, Ye Zhiming suddenly said, "How many women have you pursued?"
Ye Xuan was slightly taken aback.
Ye Zhiming asked again, "How many women has your shamelessness pursued?"
Ye Xuan smiled awkwardly. "I was just joking!"
Ye Zhiming sneered. "Joking?
I was wondering why you have so many women around you. So it's because you're shameless! "
Ye Xuan: "…"
At this time, Zhu Jianshen suddenly said, "Young Master Ye, the Goddess wants to see you!"
Ye Xuan collected his thoughts and looked at Zhu Jianshen. "Let's go!"
Zhu Jianshen nodded.
After the two of them entered the hall, Ye Xuan saw a woman in a white dress. Her long hair draped over her shoulders, and there was a purple ribbon wrapped around her forehead.
The Goddess!
In terms of appearance, the Goddess was also extremely beautiful. She was one of the rarest women in the world. And the faint smile on the Goddess' face told Ye Xuan that she was not easy to deal with.
Inside the hall, there were also some experts from the Dao Tomb!
At this time, everyone was looking at Ye Xuan.
This was the person who single-handedly killed his way to the Daoting and Daoting!
The Goddess was also sizing up Ye Xuan. She knew Ye Xuan like the back of her hand.
At this time, Ye Xuan suddenly said, "When are we getting married?"
Everyone: "…"
The Goddess's lips curled up. "Now!"
Everyone: "…"
Ye Xuan: "…"

Chapter 1354
I can do it now!
In the square, the experts of the Dao Tomb looked at the Goddess, wanting to say something but hesitating.
Ye Xuan was silent.
What is this woman trying to do?
Could it be that she has taken a fancy to my beauty?
Thinking of this, Ye Xuan couldn't help but touch his face, sighing in his heart. Being handsome is also a kind of trouble!
At this time, the Goddess suddenly said, "You can leave!
I want to talk to Young Master Ye alone! "
Inside the hall, the experts of the Dao Tomb retreated.
The Goddess walked in front of Ye Xuan, carefully looked at Ye Xuan, then smiled and said, "Young Master Ye, let's go for a walk?"
Ye Xuan nodded, "Okay!"
The two left the hall and walked towards the distant back mountain.
During this time, people would look at the two from time to time.
At this time, the Goddess gently brushed her hair behind her ear, smiled and said, "Young Master Ye, Daoting and the Dao Tomb will have a temporary truce."
Saying this, she looked at Ye Xuan.
Ye Xuan's expression was calm, "Daoting must have made some concessions!"
The Goddess smiled and said, "Several top quality mineral veins!"
Ye Xuan was a little curious, "Miss Goddess …"
The Goddess suddenly said, "Just call me Banzhi!"
"Banzhi?"
Ye Xuan looked at the Goddess.
The Goddess nodded, "Li Banzhi, my surname is Li."
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "Miss Banzhi, is this Heaven Realm Abyss important to the Dao Tomb and Daoting?"
Li Banzhi nodded, "Very important!
It is a place that both sides must fight for! "
Ye Xuan asked, "Why?"
Li Banzhi smiled and said, "Because it is rich in Fortune Crystal. Young Master Ye might not know what Fortune Crystal is, but if the Fifth Dimension wants to continue to grow, Fortune Crystal is a must!"
Ye Xuan was puzzled. "What do you mean?"
Li Banzhi said, "After one attains the Dao Realm, one must possess a single thing to charge into the Dao Defense or Dao Breaking Realm, and that's spirit energy. However, ordinary spirit energy is useless to Dao Proving Realm experts. Only the Divine Fortune Crystal can help Dao Proving Realm experts advance to the next level."
Then, she looked at Ye Xuan and said with a smile, "On average, tens of thousands of Fortune Divine Crystals can create a Dao Defense or Dao Breaking Realm expert!"
Ye Xuan frowned slightly. "As long as I have this Fortune Divine Crystal, I can reach Imperial Dao?"
Li Banzhi shook his head and smiled. "That's not it!
Only those who fulfilled the conditions, in other words, those whose cultivation had reached the limit and whose mental state was sufficient, could reach the next level after consuming the Fortune Divine Crystal.
But without the Fortune Divine Crystal, no matter how hard they cultivate, it's impossible for them to reach the next level. Without the support of powerful spiritual energy, it's like a housewife can't cook a meal without rice! "
Ye Xuan nodded. "I understand!"
Li Banzhi continued, "Before this, the Heaven Realm Abyss has always been controlled by the Daoting. Therefore, the Daoting has an extremely large number of Dao Defense experts, and they're all very strong.
But now, they're willing to give up some supreme-grade mineral veins to the Dao Tomb. "
Then, she looked at Ye Xuan. "It's obvious that they want to kill me first!"
Ye Xuan said with a smile, "What happens after you kill me?"
Li Banzhi smiled. "We'll continue to fight and fight for the Heaven Realm Abyss."
Ye Xuan said softly, "Let me guess.
You know that the truce in the Heaven Realm Abyss is actually a delaying tactic. The Daoting wants to get rid of me now, and after they get rid of me, the Daoting will continue to target the Dao Tomb.
You sent people to the Fifth Dimension to find me because you want to join forces with me.
Yes, the current situation is advantageous to you, because it's up to you whether you want to continue fighting or not, and you can decide the fate of the Fifth Dimension with a single thought. Therefore … I have to give you enough benefits, and this benefit must satisfy you. Only then will you continue to fight with the Daoting!
And the only thing on me that can move you is the Dao Scripture! "
Li Banzhi looked at Ye Xuan. "Young Master Ye is smart, but Young Master Ye is wrong about one thing. The thing that moves me is not only the Dao Scripture!"
Ye Xuan looked at Li Banzhi. "Is there anything else?"
The corner of Li Banzhi's mouth raised slightly. "The forces behind Young Master Ye!"
Ye Xuan was silent.
Li Banzhi chuckled. "Young Master Ye is not alone. As far as I know, behind Young Master Ye, there is not only the Tendo of the Fifth Dimension, but there are also some relatively mysterious powerhouses. For example, that plain-dressed woman!"
Ye Xuan said softly, "It seems that Miss Banzhi has investigated me very clearly."
Li Banzhi nodded and smiled. "Young Master Ye, I have no ill intentions.
As for the choice, my Dao Tomb will not force Young Master Ye. "
Ye Xuan looked at Li Banzhi. "There is one thing I don't understand. Why does Miss Banzhi want to marry me?
For a marriage alliance? "
Li Banzhi blinked. "Am I not worthy of Young Master Ye?"
Ye Xuan said, "You know that's not what I mean!"
Li Banzhi chuckled. "There are two reasons. First, I don't want to be enemies with Young Master Ye. However, not everyone in the Dao Tomb thinks so!
After all, the Dao scriptures on Young Master Ye are too tempting. Moreover, as far as we know, Young Master Ye has a God's Seal. To a certain extent, Young Master Ye is the guardian of the Great Dao. As for us in the Dao Tomb, we are all Dao Breakers!
However, if I get married, some people in the Dao Tomb will shut up.
Second, I have a selfish motive. The Dao Tomb is not much different from the forces in the secular world. There are also small groups. My identity is special. Whoever marries me … Young Master Ye should understand! "
Ye Xuan said with a smile, "A shield!"
Li Banzhi smiled. "Yes!"
Ye Xuan was silent.
Li Banzhi suddenly stopped. She looked at the horizon and smiled. "Young Master Ye, you can make a decision now!
It's not that I want to force Young Master Ye, but Uncle Rahu from the Abyss of Two Worlds is waiting for my answer. "
Ye Xuan looked at the horizon from the peak of the mountain. No one knew what he was thinking.
Li Banzhi held her hands behind her back. Her hair fluttered in the mountain breeze. It was a beautiful sight.
Ye Xuan suddenly smiled. "Actually, the Dao Tomb will not stop fighting regardless of whether I agree or not!"
Li Banzhi's right hand unconsciously clenched tightly when she heard this.
Ye Xuan looked at Li Banzhi. "Miss Banzhi, my Sister Nian has heavily injured the Dao Ancestor!
The Dao Tomb could be said to be a once in a lifetime opportunity!
If the Dao Tomb stops now, it's equivalent to giving Daoting a chance.
Miss Banzhi is so smart. She definitely wouldn't do such a thing. "
Li Banzhi smiled. "Young Master Ye is amazing. You've seen things so clearly.
However, Young Master Ye seems to have overlooked one thing. Daoting wants to kill even more now.
If I stop fighting and let Daoting and Young Master Ye fight to the death, then my Dao Tomb will reap the benefits. Isn't that better? "
Ye Xuan nodded. "Miss Banzhi can do that. However, Miss has a better choice. That is to join hands with my Fifth Dimension."
Li Banzhi said softly, "Young Master Ye, forgive me for being blunt. The current Fifth Dimension is of little help to my Dao Tomb!"
Ye Xuan suddenly pointed at himself. "What about me!"
Li Banzhi looked at Ye Xuan. Ye Xuan said, "Miss Banzhi, what do you think of me?"
Li Banzhi looked at Ye Xuan and blinked. "What do you want to say?"
Ye Xuan said seriously, "Miss Banzhi, do you think I'm more important or the Dao Scripture?"
Li Banzhi thought about it and said, "Young Master Ye, this question …"
Ye Xuan said seriously, "Miss Banzhi, why did you only see the Dao Scripture and not me?
Could it be that my future achievements are inferior to a few Dao Scriptures? "
Li Banzhi looked at Ye Xuan and didn't say anything.
Ye Xuan continued, "Miss Banzhi, the Dao Scripture is dead, but people are alive!
Why choose a Dao Scripture and not a person? "
Li Banzhi smiled. "Young Master Ye's words are not without reason. However, Young Master Ye, have you ever thought that if I obtain the Dao Scripture, it will be used by me? But will Young Master Ye be willing to use it for me?"
Ye Xuan shook his head. "Miss Banzhi, why do you think this way?
Think about it from another angle!
We both have the same goal, and that is to destroy Daoting!
Since we have the same goal, why not cooperate?
Since Miss can say so much calmly, you should have a good impression of me. I … "
"Good impression?"
Li Banzhi suddenly interrupted Ye Xuan's words. "Young Master Ye, sorry to interrupt, but … this good impression …"
Ye Xuan sternly said, "Miss Banzhi, you don't have a good impression of me?"
Li Banzhi was silent. She had to admit that this was the first time she met someone like Ye Xuan.
How could she answer him?
Ye Xuan continued, "Miss Banzhi, if you want to see the Dao Scripture, I can show it to you!"
Li Banzhi looked at Ye Xuan. "Really?"
Ye Xuan nodded. "Really."
As he said that, he took out five Dao Scriptures and placed them in front of Li Banzhi.
Li Banzhi didn't receive the Dao Scripture, but just looked at Ye Xuan.
Ye Xuan smiled. "Miss, are you afraid that I am cheating?"
Li Banzhi shook her head and said softly, "Young Master Ye is indeed extraordinary. I already knew about the matter of you sharing the Dao Scripture in the Fifth Dimension. To be honest, in my opinion, this is an incredible thing.
However, Young Master Ye did it. "
As she said that, she pushed the five Dao Scriptures in front of Ye Xuan. "Young Master Ye, I, Li Banzhi, am willing to teach this friend!
As I said, compared to the Dao Scripture, this person is more valuable. "
Ye Xuan said with a smile, "Is this a test?"
Li Banzhi shook her head and smiled. "No!
Young Master Ye, I can tell you clearly that before we came, our goal was the Dao Scripture. However, after meeting Young Master Ye, I changed my mind!
The Dao Scripture is not important! "
As she said that, she looked at the sky and smiled. "Young Master Ye, we will get married tonight!"
Ye Xuan was stunned.
Li Banzhi looked at Ye Xuan and smiled. "Although I value Young Master Ye more, not everyone in the Dao Tomb thinks so.
If I get married, everyone will shut up.
What do you think? "
Ye Xuan slowly closed his eyes.
At this time, Ye Zhiming's voice suddenly sounded. "This woman's goal is not simple!"
Ye Xuan said softly in his heart, "Don't worry, other than Sister Nian, no one can scheme against me!"
As he said that, he opened his eyes and looked at Li Banzhi. "Alright, let's get married!"
Ye Zhiming suddenly said, "Are you really going to marry her?"
Ye Xuan said in his heart, "Either she sleeps with me, or I sleep with her, who's afraid of who!"
Ye Zhiming: "…"
....









Chapter 1355
Marriage!
Li Banzhi did not lie. The land of Dao Tomb quickly began to hold their wedding.
...
Li Banzhi stood quietly on top of the mountain.
Next to Li Banzhi was Zhu Jianshen, who had gone to the Fifth Dimension to pick up Ye Xuan.
After a long time, Li Banzhi suddenly said, "How is it?"
Zhu Jianshen said softly, "A genius is rare in the world.
Most importantly, this person is meticulous, black-bellied, and does not stick to one pattern … "
He paused and then continued, "Girl, this person is not easy to deal with."
Li Banzhi nodded. "Indeed!"
Then, she opened her palm. Suddenly, many tiny red blood vessels appeared on her palm.
Li Banzhi said softly, "Uncle Zhu, under normal circumstances, how long will it take for me to reach Dao Completion?"
Daoting above Dao Confirmation was Imperial Dao, while the land of Dao Tomb was Dao Breaking. However, above Dao Breaking, the land of Dao Tomb was also Dao Completion!
After all, no Dao Breaker had ever walked a new path. Therefore, even Dao Breakers would eventually return to the realm of the Daoist Canon.
This was why the land of Dao Tomb cared so much about Dao Canon!
Zhu Jianshen said after a moment of silence, "At least thirty years!"
Thirty years!
Li Banzhi shook her head. "That's too long!"
Zhu Jianshen sighed. "There's no rush!"
Dao Completion!
Even in the land of Dao Tomb, there were only two of them!
Li Banzhi suddenly smiled. "Uncle Zhu, what if my Devouring Bloodline evolves again?"
Hearing this, Zhu Jianshen's pupils suddenly shrank. He looked at Li Banzhi. "Your real goal is his bloodline!"
Devouring Bloodline!
Li Banzhi's bloodline was very special. It had the power of devouring. In other words, it could devour other people's bloodline to improve itself.
Li Banzhi softly said, "The power of his bloodline is the strongest I've seen apart from my Devouring Bloodline. If I can devour his bloodline, I'll definitely be able to improve once again … Moreover, once I marry him, if he's not around, the Fifth Dimension and the Dao Scripture will naturally fall into the hands of the Dao Tomb … Three birds with one stone!"
Zhu Jianshen said solemnly, "Girl, this person is not simple. You must think carefully!"
Li Banzhi slowly closed her eyes. "It's worth the risk!"
Zhu Jianshen was silent.
Li Banzhi smiled and said, "Uncle Zhu, let's go prepare for the wedding!"
Zhu Jianshen wanted to say something but hesitated.
Li Banzhi smiled and said, "Go!"
Seeing that Li Ban had already made up his mind, Zhu Jianshen did not say anything else and turned around to leave.
On the mountain peak, Li Banzhi slowly closed her eyes. At this moment, all the blood in her body gradually trembled.
In fact, as soon as she saw Ye Xuan, her blood had been boiling. That was excitement and thrill!
The Devouring Bloodline loved powerful bloodlines the most, and it was obvious that Ye Xuan's bloodline power was very powerful.
After a long time, Li Banzhi suddenly opened her eyes and smiled. "You are an interesting person. I also want to be friends with you. Unfortunately, I want the power of your bloodline even more!"
...
In the room, Ye Xuan sat cross-legged on the ground. In front of him was the Soul Suppressing Sword!
The Soul Suppressing Sword had absorbed all the souls in the underworld. The current Soul Suppressing Sword was at the peak of the Dao Imperial Realm. If Ye Xuan's Soul Fixation Sword was added, even some Dao Imperial Realm powerhouses would find it difficult to resist. As for those below the Dao Imperial Realm, basically no one was a match for him.
And now, he was at the Dao Validation Realm!
However, his combat strength was far beyond the Dao Validation Realm.
He had three strongest trump cards. The first was the Soul Suppressing Sword. With this sword and him, even among the Dao Imperial Realm, there were few who could be a match for him. The second was the Dao scripture martial arts, Dao Fist, and Death-Seeking!
Especially the Dao Fist, the power of this fist was not something an ordinary Dao Imperial Realm powerhouse could withstand!
The last one was his bloodline power!
The power of his bloodline was the most terrifying of his three trump cards!
Once the bloodline power was activated, he would enter a state of madness. In this state, his combat strength would increase without limit until he died in battle.
In fact, he did not know much about this bloodline power. What kind of bloodline was it?
Or in other words, how strong was this bloodline?
Apart from that, there was another one, and that was the Slaughter Domain that he had previously comprehended.
His way of proving his Dao was to prove his Dao by killing!
To a certain extent, his killing intent had already surpassed the Sword Dao.
His current strength was far beyond the ordinary Dao Imperial Realm.
However, this was far from enough!
Not to mention anything else, even if he used all his trump cards, he would definitely not be able to defeat that Dao Ancestor, not to mention that there were so many Dao Imperial Realm powerhouses!
Ye Xuan slowly closed his eyes.
Dao scripture!
He had to find all the Dao scriptures.
At this moment, there was a sudden knock on the door.
Ye Xuan collected his thoughts and got up to open the door. Outside the door stood a man. It was Helian Jian.
Ye Xuan smiled. "Brother Helian!"
He Lianjian smiled faintly, "Brother Ye, congratulations!"
Ye Xuan chuckled. "Brother Helian, you didn't come here just to congratulate me, did you?"
Helian Jian nodded. "Brother Ye, I heard that Tu Ming came back from the Heaven Abyss!"
Ye Xuan said softly, "Banzhi's pursuer?"
Helian Jian nodded. "Yes!
Brother Ye, this person is not simple. He is known as the second person of the younger generation in the Dao Tomb. His strength is only second to the Goddess, and he is the number one pursuer of the Goddess. Most importantly, he has the Tu family behind him. The Tu family has great influence in the Dao Tomb, and they have always wanted the Goddess to marry Tu Ming. So this time, Tu Ming did not come with good intentions! "
Ye Xuan nodded slightly. "I understand!"
Helian Jian said in a deep voice, "Brother Ye, the waters of the Dao Tomb are very deep. You must be careful!"
Ye Xuan smiled. "Thank you for telling me!"
Helian Jian shook his head. "I should be the one thanking you!
Someone asked me to follow Zhu Jianshen to the Fifth Dimension to find him. In fact, they wanted to kill me with a borrowed knife. If you had not shown mercy, I would have died!
Not only would I have died, but I might have died without knowing why. "
Saying this, he suddenly bowed respectfully to Ye Xuan. "Thank you, Brother Ye, for not killing me that day!"
After getting to know Ye Xuan, he realized how terrifying Ye Xuan's strength was!
Because of this, he was grateful to Ye Xuan. Because not only did Ye Xuan not kill him, but he also reminded him!
Ye Xuan smiled. "Brother Helian, do you know who wants you dead?"
Helian Jian nodded. "I know!
But … "
Saying this, he shook his head with a bitter smile. "What can I do?
They did not force me to go. "
Ye Xuan patted Helian Jian's shoulder. "It's okay, there will be opportunities for revenge!"
Helian Jian nodded. "I understand!"
At this time, a woman suddenly appeared. The woman was holding a groom's clothes. She glanced at Ye Xuan. "Young Master Ye, it's time to get married!"
Ye Xuan burst out laughing. "We are married!"
Saying this, he waved his right hand and the groom's clothes appeared in his hand.
Get married!
Inside the Dao Tomb Palace. At this time, many experts of the Dao Tomb Palace had gathered. At this moment, these experts all had a strange expression!
Get married!
This Goddess and Ye Xuan got married just because they said they wanted to!
The two of them had just met!
When Ye Xuan entered the main hall, Li Banzhi was already waiting. At this time, Li Banzhi was wearing a red wedding robe. However, she did not cover her head with a red veil. Because of this, her peerless appearance was unreservedly displayed in front of everyone's eyes.
It had to be said that Li Banzhi was very beautiful.
Li Banzhi looked at Ye Xuan and smiled. "Let's begin!"
Ye Xuan smiled. "Then let's begin!"
As he said this, he walked to Li Banzhi's side and directly took her hand. Li Banzhi's expression fluctuated a little, but she quickly calmed down. She did not withdraw her hand.
Ye Xuan took Li Banzhi's hand and walked to a place not far away.
Only a bastard would not take advantage of an opportunity!
After three bows, Ye Xuan and Li Banzhi directly went to the bridal chamber, leaving behind the experts of the Dao Tomb Palace in a mess.
The location of the bridal chamber was beyond Ye Xuan's expectation. Because it was in a basement, a very deep basement.
Ye Xuan looked around. The surroundings were sealed. There was only a bed and a few simple wooden tables.
Li Banzhi smiled. "This is where I usually cultivate. It's a little crude. You don't mind, do you?"
Ye Xuan shook his head and smiled. "I don't mind!"
As he said this, he sat on the bed. He looked at Li Banzhi. "Miss Banzhi, isn't it a fake marriage?"
Li Banzhi smiled. "It's a fake marriage. However, we have to put on a good show. What do you think?"
Ye Xuan nodded. "That's true!"
As he said this, he sat on a chair and said, "Miss Banzhi, you can sleep on the bed!"
Li Banzhi sat on the bed. She looked at Ye Xuan and smiled. "You come over too!"
Ye Xuan smiled. "That's not very good, is it?"
Li Banzhi blinked. She was a little playful. "Why? Are you afraid that I'll eat you?"
Ye Xuan smiled. He walked to the bed and sat next to Li Banzhi.
At this moment, Li Banzhi suddenly pulled Ye Xuan's hand. Ye Xuan glanced at Li Banzhi and did not resist.
Li Banzhi smiled. "I've investigated Young Master Ye. To be honest, I have some admiration for Young Master Ye, especially for Young Master Ye's character. Young Master Ye values friendship and righteousness. He treats the Dao Scriptures like dirt …"
As she said this, she shook her head and smiled. "Just this point alone, there are very few men in the world who can compare to Young Master Ye!"
Ye Xuan looked at Li Banzhi. He smiled. "Miss Banzhi, do you really admire me?"
Li Banzhi blinked. "Not really. However, I do have a good impression of you!"
Ye Xuan smiled. "Miss Banzhi, we're friends now, right?"
Li Banzhi nodded. "Yes!"
As she said this, she looked at Ye Xuan. "Since we're friends, I'd like to borrow something from you!"
Ye Xuan asked with a smile. "What is it?"
Although he was smiling, inside the Prison Pagoda, the Soul Suppressing Sword was ready to go.
Li Banzhi's lips suddenly curled up. "I want to borrow Young Master Ye's blood!"
As soon as she said this, a mysterious force suddenly enveloped Ye Xuan. In an instant, countless blood-red ropes appeared all over Ye Xuan's body. These ropes bound Ye Xuan tightly.
Ye Xuan looked at Li Banzhi. His expression was calm. "Miss Banzhi, what are you trying to do?
Do you want to play with special spirits? "
Li Banzhi smiled. "To tell you the truth, I want to devour Young Master Ye's blood!"
Hearing this, Ye Xuan was stunned.
The next moment, the Soul Suppressing Sword in his body suddenly calmed down.
Ye Xuan looked at Li Banzhi. This woman wants to fight with me?
Or is she going to fight with her father?
However, Ye Xuan was still a little apprehensive. Is my father reliable? If he's not, then I can't beat him …
.....
PS: There are very few tickets recently. I'm very unhappy!
Don't force me to release chapters!
When I release chapters, even I'm afraid of myself!









Chapter 1356
It had to be said that Ye Xuan was a little confused at this moment.
He knew that the woman in front of him must have a purpose, but he did not expect that she wanted to devour his blood!
Bloodline Power!
Ye Xuan, who was about to attack, stopped.
Although his body was locked by a mysterious force, he was confident that he could destroy this mysterious force.
Whether it was Daoting or the Dao Tomb, they had underestimated his strength.
However, he did not choose to attack.
He was very confident in the power of his bloodline!
Devour my blood?
He wanted to see if Li Banzhi's bloodline power was stronger, or if his bloodline power was stronger!
Although he was confident in his Bloodline Power, the Soul Suppressing Sword in his body was still ready to attack at any time!
In front of Ye Xuan, Li Banzhi suddenly said, "You are very calm!"
Ye Xuan looked at Li Banzhi and smiled, "Miss Banzhi, I thought you were different from others, but unfortunately, you still chose the benefits in front of you."
Li Banzhi smiled, "If it wasn't for your special Bloodline, I would choose to be friends with you, but unfortunately …"
Saying that, she shook her head and smiled, "Do you have any last words?"
Ye Xuan was silent.
Li Banzhi smiled, "If you don't say anything, then there's nothing!"
Saying that, she suddenly pressed her right hand on Ye Xuan's shoulder. In an instant, the blood in Ye Xuan's body began to tremble.
At this moment, Li Banzhi suddenly became excited, "I can feel that your Bloodline Power is extremely powerful. If my Devouring Bloodline devours your Bloodline Power, it will definitely be able to reach a higher level!"
Saying that, she suddenly raised her right hand. In an instant, a stream of blood suddenly rushed out of Ye Xuan's body. This stream of blood directly entered her body through Li Banzhi's right hand.
Boom!
In an instant, Li Banzhi's body turned blood red!
Li Banzhi slowly closed her eyes and said excitedly, "What a powerful Bloodline Power, good …"
Saying that, she suddenly opened her eyes, "What … What's going on …"
Ye Xuan looked at Li Banzhi without saying a word.
Li Banzhi said in horror, "No … Impossible … Absolutely impossible …"
In her body, Ye Xuan's blood was devouring her bloodline!
Ye Xuan's bloodline was going to take over?
Li Banzhi hurriedly circulated her bloodline power, wanting to suppress Ye Xuan's bloodline. However, she was horrified to find that her bloodline power could not suppress Ye Xuan's bloodline at all!
Ye Xuan's bloodline was frantically devouring her bloodline!
At this moment, Li Banzhi was really panicking!
Seeming to have thought of something, Li Banzhi suddenly looked at Ye Xuan and said with astonishment, "You can control that blood!"
Ye Xuan nodded.
Li Banzhi stared at Ye Xuan. "Stop your bloodline power!"
A ray of sword light suddenly flew out from Ye Xuan's body. The next moment, all the red threads that locked him disappeared without a trace.
Ye Xuan looked at Li Banzhi and said with a smile, "Miss Li, was it fun?"
Li Banzhi said in a deep voice, "I underestimated you!
I should say, I underestimated your bloodline power! "
Ye Xuan nodded, "Yes."
Li Banzhi looked at Ye Xuan and suddenly smiled, "Let's cooperate, just like what we said before!"
Ye Xuan shook his head and smiled, "Sorry, I don't want to cooperate with you anymore!"
Li Banzhi looked calm, "It doesn't matter if you don't want to cooperate. Young master Ye can leave."
Ye Xuan looked at Li Banzhi and did not say anything.
Li Banzhi raised the corner of her mouth, "Young master Ye, don't tell me you want to kill me?"
Ye Xuan nodded, "That's what I thought."
Li Banzhi looked at Ye Xuan with a calm expression, "You won't do that!
You won't dare to do that!
If I die here, you should know the consequences!
You should know that Young master Ye and the Fifth Dimension are in a terrible situation. If I die in the hands of Young master Ye, then Young master Ye will become enemies with Daoting and the Dao Tomb. Young master Ye is so smart, he will not let himself and the Fifth Dimension fall into such a desperate situation, right? "
Ye Xuan shook his head, "You're wrong!"
As his voice fell, he suddenly slashed out with his sword.
Chi!
Li Banzhi's throat was directly split open!
Li Banzhi's eyes were wide open as she stared at Ye Xuan. Her eyes were filled with disbelief. She never thought that Ye Xuan would really dare to kill her!
How could Ye Xuan be so brainless?
How could this be?
Was he not afraid of the Dao Tomb's revenge?
A series of questions flashed through Li Banzhi's mind.
At this time, Ye Xuan suddenly smiled, "Miss Banzhi, from your expression, you seem a little surprised!"
Li Banzhi stared at Ye Xuan. She wanted to inform the outside world, but she was firmly suppressed by Ye Xuan's bloodline power. The current her could not mobilize even the slightest bit of her strength!
If Ye Xuan's bloodline power was outside, it would not be able to do anything to her. However, Ye Xuan's bloodline power was inside her body. Right now, Ye Xuan had dominated her body.
As long as Ye Xuan willed it, her body would immediately explode and she would die.
Li Banzhi slowly closed her eyes, "Tell me, how are you going to deal with this?
Let me die in peace! "
Ye Xuan's right hand gently stroked Li Banzhi's cheek, "Miss Banzhi, I have to say, you are very beautiful. I can't bear to destroy such a beautiful woman …"
As he spoke, he slowly clenched his right hand. In an instant, a powerful force gathered in the palm of his hand.
Li Banzhi looked at Ye Xuan, waiting for Ye Xuan's performance.
At this time, a ruthless look flashed in Ye Xuan's eyes. He punched himself. In an instant, a world-destroying power erupted from the secret chamber like a flood.
Dao Fist!
This time, Ye Xuan used Dao Fist. As soon as this punch was thrown, the entire Dao Tomb was shocked …
When Ye Xuan punched his chest, Li Banzhi was slightly stunned. Then, she softly said, "Good plan!"
At this time, she already understood how Ye Xuan was going to deal with the aftermath.
Boom!
As Ye Xuan's punch landed on his chest, the entire secret chamber suddenly turned to ashes. At the same time, the space within a radius of tens of thousands of miles directly exploded at this moment. At the same time, Li Banzhi's body also exploded.
Her Spiritual Soul was destroyed!
The entire Dao Tomb was shocked!
Someone attacked the Dao Tomb?
Soon, countless experts arrived at the scene of the incident. The first to arrive was Zhu Jianshen. When he saw that the secret chamber had turned to ashes, Zhu Jianshen's face immediately became extremely ugly. He glanced around and in the next moment, he directly appeared in front of Ye Xuan.
At this moment, Ye Xuan could be said to be a tragic sight.
Ye Xuan's body had already split open and blood flowed continuously. His aura was also extremely weak, as if he could die at any time!
Zhu Jianshen did not care about Ye Xuan. He glanced around and soon, his face turned pale.
Where was Li Banzhi?
At this time, the experts of the Dao Tomb also arrived at the scene. When they saw Ye Xuan's appearance, all the experts of the Dao Tomb were stunned.
What is going on?
Meanwhile, Zhu Jianshen suddenly lifted Ye Xuan up, and he stared fixedly at Ye Xuan, "What's going on?"
Ye Xuan didn't speak. Blood sprayed from his mouth repeatedly, and he seemed like he could die at any moment!
An expert from the Dao Tomb spoke in a low voice, "His injuries are too severe!"
Zhu Jianshen spoke furiously, "Where's Banzhi?"
Ye Xuan still didn't answer him, and he just kept spitting blood.
Zhu Jianshen intended to ask more questions, but an old man spoke abruptly, "Calm down and heal him first!"
Zhu Jianshen stared fixedly at Ye Xuan, and a short moment passed before he withdrew a medicinal pill and gave it to Ye Xuan. As soon as he consumed the medicinal pill, Ye Xuan's aura instantly became slightly stronger.
Zhu Jianshen hurriedly asked, "Where's Banzhi?"
Ye Xuan glanced at the surroundings and was slightly dazed, "Where's Banzhi?"
Zhu Jianshen's brows knit together slightly. Meanwhile, the old man spoke solemnly, "Young Master Ye, what exactly happened just now?"
Ye Xuan suddenly seemed to have gone mad, "Where's Banzhi?"
As he spoke, he grabbed Zhu Jianshen's collar and roared furiously, "Where's Banzhi?
Where's my Banzhi? "
Zhu Jianshen was speechless.
Everyone in the surroundings looked at each other.
Suddenly, a middle aged man spoke in a trembling voice, "Elder Zhu, the Goddess's Soul Tablet … has shattered!"
It had shattered!
The expressions of all the experts here instantly changed drastically!
Zhu Jianshen's face instantly turned pale as well.
Meanwhile, Ye Xuan suddenly roared furiously, "Her Soul Tablet has shattered?
What do you mean?
Huh?
What do you mean? "
As he spoke, he grabbed the middle aged man and roared like a wild beast, "What do you mean by her Soul Tablet has shattered?
Huh? "
The middle aged man hesitated for a moment before he spoke in a trembling voice, "Young Master Ye, the Goddess has probably suffered misfortune …."
"Impossible!"
Ye Xuan suddenly roared furiously, and his voice was like a thunderclap that shook the sky, "Impossible!
It's absolutely impossible for anything to have happened to Banzhi!
It's absolutely impossible! "
At this moment, his voice wasn't just trembling, even his expression was filled with terror. It was like he'd lost the love of his life.
The middle aged man glanced at Ye Xuan, sighed softly, and didn't dare speak another word.
Meanwhile, Ye Xuan suddenly held his head in his hands and howled, and his voice was filled with boundless sorrow.
Zhu Jianshen suddenly spoke in a low voice, "Young Master Ye, what happened just now?"
Everyone here gazed at Ye Xuan, but Ye Xuan was still howling with sorrow as if he was about to cry himself to death.
All of them were speechless.
Zhu Jianshen walked over to Ye Xuan and spoke in a low voice, "Young Master Ye, what exactly happened just now?"
Ye Xuan suddenly raised his head, and at this moment, his face was already covered in tears.
Everyone looked at Ye Xuan, who was already crying, and their hearts were quite complicated. This guy was indeed a sentimental person!
Ye Xuan spoke in a low voice, "Just now, I entered the secret room with Ban Zhi, and Ban Zhi said that he had something important to tell me, but at this moment, a mysterious person suddenly appeared in the secret room … and then he punched …"
Speaking of this, there was a trace of fear in his eyes, "I've never seen such a powerful punch!
Just that punch, I was directly sent flying … "
Zhu Jianshen frowned slightly, "Mysterious person?"
Ye Xuan nodded, "Yes, mysterious person … I couldn't see his true appearance. He was very close to me, but for some reason, I just couldn't see his face …"
Speaking of this, he suddenly looked at Zhu Jianshen, "I remember Ban Zhi said something!"
Zhu Jianshen hurriedly asked. "What did he say!"
Ye Xuan clenched his hands, "Ban Zhi said 'Daoting …'
Daoting!
Hearing this, the faces of all the powerhouses suddenly became ferocious!
At this moment, Ye Xuan suddenly said fiercely, "Daoting!
It must be Daoting!
Ah ah ah ah!
Daoting, I, Ye Xuan, swear to the heavens that I will not live under the same sky as you … "
Everyone: "…"
...









Chapter 1357
Ye Xuan had a ferocious expression on his face, and he emanated an oppressive killing intent.
As for the Daoting experts, their expressions were extremely gloomy as well!
Daoting had actually made a move!
Meanwhile, Zhu Jianshen spoke abruptly, "Young Master Ye, can you tell us about what happened earlier in detail?"
Ye Xuan closed his eyes slowly, and his voice trembled as he spoke, "I've already told you!
As soon as Banzhi and I entered the secret chamber, that mysterious expert appeared before us. Banzhi was just about to call for help, but that mysterious expert attacked!
After that, it became like this. "
Zhu Jianshen spoke solemnly, "But we didn't notice any Daoting expert!"
Ye Xuan's expression suddenly became solemn, "He's very strong. Because Banzhi and I didn't have the time to fight back!"
As he spoke, he shook his head, "If my body wasn't strong enough, then I'm afraid my soul would have been obliterated as well!"
Zhu Jianshen glanced at Ye Xuan's body. Needless to say, Ye Xuan's injuries were very severe indeed.
A short moment later, Zhu Jianshen said, "Young Master Ye, go heal your injuries first!"
Meanwhile, Ye Xuan's expression changed drastically, "Shit!
My scriptures are gone! "
Dao scriptures!
Zhu Jianshen frowned slightly, "Dao scriptures?"
Ye Xuan nodded, and his face was covered in terror, "Right, I brought five Dao scriptures with me before I came here, but they're gone now!
They're gone! "
The experts of the Dao Tomb exchanged glances when they heard this.
Meanwhile, an old man suddenly spoke solemnly, "It's definitely Daoting!"
Another expert nodded, "Besides Daoting, there's no one else!
We were too careless this time! "
Zhu Jianshen suddenly said, "Young Master Ye, go heal your injuries first!
Heal your injuries first! "
Ye Xuan glanced at Zhu Jianshen, cupped his fists, and then turned around and left.
After Ye Xuan left, Zhu Jianshen slowly closed his eyes.
Meanwhile, the old man by Zhu Jianshen's side suddenly said, "You don't believe him?"
Zhu Jianshen shook his head. "This matter is a little strange!
However, he had no reason to kill half of them!
Moreover, even if he had a reason to kill Half Zhe, there was no way he could do it in an instant. The person who did it must be far stronger than Half Zhe.
Moreover, the injuries he suffered weren't fake. His injuries were truly severe, his flesh almost collapsing.
Furthermore, he's a Swordsman, and that power just now didn't have any Sword Qi or Sword Intent fluctuations … "
As he spoke, he looked into the distance and said softly, "All the signs show that he wasn't the one who did this … but I still feel that there's something fishy about this!"
The old man said in a deep voice, "Even if he has the ability to kill half of them, he has no reason to do so!
Currently, the Fifth Dimension already has a great enemy in the form of Daoting. Ye Xuan is not stupid enough to kill half of them at this time and become enemies with the Dao Tomb.
Therefore, I think that the person who did it is Daoting.
The reason why he did it is obviously because he doesn't want the Dao Tomb to form a marriage alliance with Ye Xuan. In other words, he doesn't want the Dao Scriptures to fall into the hands of the Dao Tomb! "
Dao Scriptures!
Zhu Jianshen's pupils suddenly shrank. "I almost forgot about this … Dao Scriptures!
Ye Xuan has no reason to kill half of them, but Daoting does! "
As he said this, his face became a little ugly. "We were too stupid!
This time, Ye Xuan didn't come here empty-handed. He brought five Dao Scriptures with him. Five Dao Scriptures!
How could Daoting let those five Dao Scriptures fall into our hands? If I were them, I would also stop them at all costs. "
The old man nodded. "We were careless this time!"
As he spoke, he looked at Zhu Jianshen. "What now?"
Zhu Jianshen said fiercely. "Inform Luo Hou that the Goddess was killed by the experts of Daoting!"
The old man nodded. "Okay!"
As he said this, he turned and left.
In the hall, Zhu Jianshen was silent.
In fact, he had suspected Ye Xuan, but he should say it …
Green City, Ye Clan, Ancestral Hall.
"Ancestors, Ye Xuan has no talent and no virtue … From now on, Ye Xuan's position as the Crown Prince will be replaced by Ye Lang."
The one who spoke was an old man in a black robe.
Not far behind the old man stood a young man with a faint smile on his face.
This person was Ye Lang.
On both sides were the Ye Clan's Elders.
"Why!"
At this moment, a timid voice suddenly sounded in the ancestral hall.
Everyone looked at the voice and saw a little girl standing at the door. The little girl was about twelve or thirteen years old. Her two little hands were tightly gripping the hem of her skirt. Her face was sickly pale and looked a little weak. There was a trace of timidity in her eyes.
This little girl was called Ye Ling, Ye Xuan's younger sister. When she heard that the Clan wanted to remove Ye Xuan, she rushed over despite her illness.
The black-robed old man frowned. "Ye Ling, what are you doing!"
The little girl called Ye Ling bowed to the people in the ancestral hall and said timidly, "Great Elder, my brother Ye Xuan is the Crown Prince. Why did you remove him for no reason?"
The Great Elder looked coldly at Ye Ling. "This is a matter of the Clan. Why are you interrupting?
Leave! "
Ye Ling was obviously afraid and did not dare to look at the Great Elder. However, she did not leave. Instead, she mustered up her courage and walked into the ancestral hall. She bowed again to the Elders on both sides. "Dear Elders, my brother is fighting with the Li Clan over the mining rights at Nanshan. He is fighting for the Clan, and it is unknown whether he is dead or alive. Yet, the Clan is using a groundless excuse to remove his Crown Prince position. This is really unfair."
"How dare you!"
The Great Elder suddenly said angrily, "It is not up to a little girl like you to decide whether to remove him or not.
Someone, drag her away. "
At this moment, the new Crown Prince, Ye Lang, suddenly smiled. "You should be flogged thirty times as a warning to others!"
The Great Elder said coldly, "Then flog him thirty times!"
Soon, two guards of the Ye Clan rushed in.
Ye Ling clenched her fists and said angrily, "This is unfair. My brother has risked his life for the Clan for so many years. Even now, he is fighting for the Clan. The Clan is unfair to him …"
One of the guards glanced at the new Crown Prince, Ye Lang. He knew that this was his chance to perform.
The guard smiled coldly. "Young Master Ye Lang will inherit the Crown Prince position. Why are you shouting?" As he spoke, he raised his hand and slapped Ye Ling's face.
Slap!
A crisp slap sounded. The right side of Ye Ling's face instantly turned red and swollen. However, she did not cry. She only covered her cheek tightly.
Ye Lang looked at the guard and smiled. "What's your name?"
The guard hurriedly bowed. "This subordinate, Zhang Mu, greets the Crown Prince."
Ye Lang nodded. "You are very good. After I become the Crown Prince, I will need ten personal guards. You can be my personal guard from now on."
Hearing this, Zhang Mu was overjoyed. He hurriedly bowed deeply. "This subordinate will go through fire and water for the Crown Prince. I will not hesitate to die ten thousand times!"
Ye Lang nodded slightly. "Drag him away. This person is disturbing the ancestral hall. Do not hold back. Do you understand?"
Zhang Mu glanced at Ye Lang. When he saw the murderous intent in Ye Lang's eyes, he understood.
He immediately grabbed Ye Ling's hair and dragged her out.
At this moment, Zhang Mu suddenly stopped as if he had seen something.
Inside the ancestral hall, everyone turned their heads to look outside.
Not far from the ancestral hall, a young man was walking towards the ancestral hall. He was wearing a tight-fitting robe that was tattered and covered in blood.
This person was Ye Xuan, who had rushed back from Nanshan!
Seeing Ye Xuan, Ye Lang's lips curled into a cold smile.
Inside the ancestral hall, all the Elders frowned.
The Great Elder narrowed his eyes, his expression dark. No one knew what he was thinking.
From afar, when Ye Xuan saw Zhang Mu dragging Ye Ling, his expression turned savage. "Who gave you the guts to touch my sister?"
When Zhang Mu saw Ye Xuan, his expression changed. He quickly looked at Ye Lang and was about to speak. At this time, Ye Xuan leaped in front of him like a ferocious tiger. Before the latter could react, Ye Xuan's fist landed on his face.
Peng!
Zhang Mu felt a wave of dizziness, and he stumbled and fell.
Ye Lang did not stop there. He charged towards Zhang Mu again. At this time, Ye Lang suddenly roared, "Ye Xuan, he's my man. How dare you …"
Ye Xuan suddenly stepped on Zhang Mu's chest.
Pui!
Zhang Mu spat out a mouthful of blood.
Seeing this, Ye Lang's expression turned ugly. Ye Xuan lifted his head to look at him, asking savagely, "Your man?"
As he spoke, he stomped down on Zhang Mu's face.
Zhang Mu's face turned into a bloody mess, as he screamed, "Prince, save, save me …"
Ye Xuan did not care about Zhang Mu, as he walked to Ye Ling's side. Seeing Ye Ling's appearance, Ye Xuan felt as though his heart was being sliced apart. He clenched his fists, and his entire body trembled.
When Ye Ling saw Ye Xuan, tears welled up in her eyes, "Brother, it hurts, it hurts …"
Hearing this, Ye Xuan's expression turned savage. In the next instant, he charged in front of Zhang Mu and kicked Zhang Mu's head.
Peng!
Qingcheng, Ye Clan, Ancestral Hall.
"Ancestors, Ye Xuan has no talent, no morals … From now on, Ye Xuan's position will be removed, and Ye Lang will take over."
The one who spoke was an old man in black robes.
Not far behind the old man stood a young man with a faint smile on his face.
This person was Ye Lang.
On both sides, there were the Elders of the Ye Clan.
"Why!?"
Right at this moment, a slightly timid voice suddenly resounded within the ancestral hall.
Everyone turned to look and saw a little girl standing at the door. She was about 12 or 13 years old, and her hands were tightly gripping the hem of her skirt. Her face had a sickly pallor, and she looked a little weak. There was even a trace of fear in her eyes.
This girl was called Ye Ling, and she was Ye Xuan's younger sister. When she heard that Ye Xuan was about to be removed, she disregarded her illness and rushed over.
The black-robed old man frowned, "Ye Ling, what are you doing!?"
The little girl called Ye Ling bowed to the people in the hall, and said timidly, "Great Elder, my brother Ye Xuan is a Crown Prince, why did you remove him for no reason?"
The Great Elder looked at Ye Ling coldly, "This is a matter of the Clan, what are you interrupting?
Leave! "
Ye Ling was obviously afraid, and did not dare to look at the Great Elder, but she did not leave. Instead, she plucked up her courage and walked into the hall. She bowed again to the Elders on both sides, "Elders, my brother is fighting with the Li Clan over the mining rights at Nanshan. He is fighting for the Clan, and we don't know if he's dead or alive. Yet, the Clan is using a groundless excuse to remove him from the Crown Prince position. This is unfair."
"Impudent!"
The Great Elder suddenly raged, "It's not up to a little girl like you to decide whether to remove him or not.
Men, drag her away. "
At this moment, the new Crown Prince Ye Lang suddenly laughed, "You should be flogged thirty times as a warning to others!"
The Great Elder said coldly, "Then flog him thirty times!"
Soon, two guards of the Ye Clan rushed in.
Ye Ling clenched her fists, and said angrily, "This is unfair. My brother has risked his life for the Clan for so many years, and even now he is fighting for the Clan. The Clan is unfair to him …"
One of the guards glanced at the new Crown Prince Ye Lang, and he knew that his chance to show off had come.
The guard sneered, "Young Master Ye Lang inherits the Crown Prince position, and it's everyone's wish. What are you shouting for?" With that, he raised his hand and slapped Ye Ling's face.
Slap!
A crisp slap sounded, and the right side of Ye Ling's face instantly swelled up, but she did not cry. She just held her cheek tightly.
Ye Lang looked at the guard, and smiled, "What's your name?"
The guard hurriedly bowed, "I'm Zhang Mu, greeting the Crown Prince."
Ye Lang nodded, "You're not bad. After I become the Crown Prince, I'll need ten guards. You can be my guard from now on."
Hearing this, Zhang Mu was overjoyed, and he hurriedly bowed deeply, "I'll go through fire and water for the Crown Prince, and I'll do anything for you!"
Ye Lang nodded slightly, "Drag him out. This person is disturbing the ancestral hall, so don't hold back. Do you understand?"
Zhang Mu glanced at Ye Lang, and when he saw the murderous intent in Ye Lang's eyes, he understood.
Immediately, he grabbed Ye Ling's hair and dragged her out.
At this moment, Zhang Mu seemed to have seen something, and he suddenly stopped.
In the ancestral hall, everyone turned their heads to look outside.
Not far from the ancestral hall, a young man was walking towards the ancestral hall. The young man was wearing a tight-fitting robe that was torn, and there was blood everywhere.
This person was Ye Xuan, who had rushed back from the South Mountain!
Seeing Ye Xuan, Ye Lang's lips curled into a cold smile.
Inside the ancestral hall, the Elders frowned.
The Great Elder narrowed his eyes, and his expression was frighteningly dark. No one knew what he was thinking.
From afar, when Ye Xuan saw Zhang Mu dragging Ye Ling, his expression turned savage, "Who gave you the guts to touch my sister?"
When Zhang Mu saw Ye Xuan, his expression changed. He hurriedly looked at Ye Lang, and just as he was about to speak, Ye Xuan leaped in front of him like a ferocious tiger. Before the latter could react, Ye Xuan's fist landed on his face.
Peng!
Zhang Mu felt a wave of dizziness, and he stumbled and fell.
However, Ye Ling did not stop there. He charged towards Zhang Mu again. At this time, Ye Lang suddenly roared, "Ye Xuan, he's my man! How dare you …"
Ye Xuan suddenly stepped on Zhang Mu's chest.
Pu!
Zhang Mu spat out a mouthful of blood.
Seeing this, Ye Lang's expression turned ugly. Ye Xuan looked up at him and said, "Your man?"
As he spoke, he stepped on Zhang Mu's face.
Zhang Mu's face turned into a bloody mess, as he screamed, "Prince, save, save me …"
Ye Xuan did not care about Zhang Mu, as he walked to Ye Ling's side. Seeing Ye Ling's state, Ye Xuan felt as though his heart was being sliced by a knife. He clenched his fists, and his entire body trembled.
When Ye Ling saw Ye Xuan, her tears flowed, "Brother, it hurts, it hurts …"
Hearing this, Ye Xuan's expression turned savage. In the next instant, he charged in front of Zhang Mu and kicked Zhang Mu's head.
Peng!









Chapter 1358
To Heaven Realm Abyss!
Ye Xuan was not putting on an act, he was really going to Heaven Realm Abyss.
Either he died, or Daoting died!
After Ye Xuan left, more and more experts from the Dao Tomb headed for Heaven Realm Abyss!
Banzhi's death was basically a foregone conclusion.
It was done by Daoting!
Who else could it be other than Daoting?
The Heaven Realm Abyss that had stopped fighting began once again!
...
In the starry sky, Ye Xuan was flying on his sword.
It was a pity because he did not use the Soul Suppressing Sword to absorb Banzhi's soul. Li Banzhi's soul was abnormally strong, if he could absorb it, the Soul Suppressing Sword would be greatly enhanced.
In addition, the other party's bloodline was also very tempting!
However, he did not choose to devour the other party's bloodline!
Because it was too risky!
At this time, Ye Zhiming suddenly said, "Do you think the Dao Tomb will suspect you?"
Ye Xuan said softly, "Didn't Zhu Jianshen suspect me before?
But I believe that they will choose to believe me in the end! "
Ye Zhiming asked, "Why?"
Ye Xuan said, "Just one point, they do not think that I have the strength to kill Li Banzhi.
Li Banzhi was killed in an instant without any resistance. In their hearts, do you think that I, Ye Xuan, have the strength? "
Ye Zhiming sighed softly.
In fact, this time it was Li Banzhi's own fault.
If not for the other party wanting to devour his bloodline, even if Ye Xuan wanted to kill him, he would not have the ability. In a one on one fight, Ye Xuan might be able to win, but that was the Dao Tomb!
One word from Li Banzhi and Ye Xuan would die in a group fight!
But this Li Banzhi wanted to devour Ye Xuan's bloodline!
What was the most abnormal part of Ye Xuan's body?
It was his blood!
However, Ye Zhiming did not have the slightest bit of sympathy for Li Banzhi.
That woman wanted to devour Ye Xuan's bloodline. Once she succeeded, coupled with the fact that she was already married to Ye Xuan, it was very likely that she would be able to smoothly take over the entire Fifth Dimension.
It could be said that the woman's plan was very vicious.
Not only did he want to kill Ye Xuan, but he also wanted to obtain Ye Xuan's Dao Scripture and the Five-Dimensional Universe.
However, the other party did not expect Ye Xuan's bloodline power to be so strong.
It could be said that Li Banzhi had died, and he had also lost the Dao Tomb.
At this time, Ye Xuan suddenly took out the Qiankun Gourd.
Immortal Gourd!
Ye Xuan didn't forget about it. He hadn't used the gourd yet!
Ye Xuan asked, "Immortal Gourd, is the Whirling World very strong?"
The Gourd Immortal hurriedly replied, "Of course!
Very, very strong! "
Ye Xuan asked again, "How strong is it?"
The Gourd Immortal fell silent.
Ye Xuan said, "For example, if I go to the Whirling World, what level do I belong to?"
The Gourd Immortal thought for a moment and said, "A top expert!
However, there are still people who can beat you! "
Ye Xuan said softly, "I understand!"
He was quite curious about the Whirling World. After all, it was the origin of the Dao Scripture.
The Gourd Immortal suddenly asked, "Why are you suddenly asking me this question?"
Ye Xuan said softly, "I have a feeling that the Whirling World will also become my enemy!"
The Gourd Immortal: "…"
Ye Xuan said again, "No matter what, we have to prepare for the worst."
With that, he slowly closed his eyes.
The Gourd Immortal said, "The Whirling World also has the Dao Scripture that you mentioned!"
Ye Xuan opened his eyes. "Which one?"
The Gourd Immortal said, "I don't know about that!"
Ye Xuan fell silent.
If he wanted to collect all the Dao Scriptures, wouldn't he have to go to the Whirling World?
Ye Xuan's expression gradually darkened.
Collecting all the Dao Scriptures was not an easy task!
However, he did not plan to give up.
One step at a time!
Ye Xuan collected his thoughts and sped up.
...
Heaven Abyss.
Heaven Abyss was located in an ancient starry sky. In this starry sky, there was a huge starry sky abyss. No one knew how this starry sky abyss was formed, and no one cared about this question!
Because everyone cared about the Fortune Crystal in this starry sky abyss!
In this starry sky abyss, there were countless mineral veins, and these mineral veins produced the Fortune Crystal!
For Dao Validation experts, there were perhaps two things in this world that were most precious. One was the Dao Scripture, and the other was the Fortune Crystal!
Even with the Dao Scripture, without the Fortune Crystal, they would not be able to advance further.
Cultivation required money!
The higher one advanced, the more money they needed!
This was also why there was the Daoting and the Dao Tomb. Because when everyone gathered together, they could earn money faster and more.
It could be said that Heaven Abyss was a place that Daoting and the Dao Tomb had to fight for!
This was also why the experts of Heaven Abyss did not return to the Daoting even after such a huge incident. This was because this was the lifeline of Daoting!
If the Dao Tomb completely occupied this place, the consequences would be unimaginable.
In the south of Heaven Abyss, there was a huge sky palace. This sky palace was the base of Daoting in Heaven Abyss.
In the main hall of the sky palace, there were only two people.
One was the White Emperor Starlord who had rushed over from Daoting!
The other person was Sir God Real Martial!
The True Martial God had a burly figure. His hair was loose, and he wore golden chain armor. He stood with his hand on his sword. His eyes were like lightning, and he exuded a powerful aura that could take one's soul away.
The True Martial God was the leader of the Daoting Divine Lords, and now the commander of the Daoting army.
The True Martial God suddenly said, "Bai Dizi, what do you think about the death of the Divine Lady in the Dao Tomb?"
Bai Dizi said softly, "It must be Ye Xuan!"
The True Martial God looked at Bai Dizi. "What do you mean?"
Bai Dizi said, "We didn't do anything. Who else could it be?"
The True Martial God frowned. "Does Ye Xuan have the strength to kill the Divine Lady?"
Bai Dizi shook his head. "Probably not, but it must be him.
He killed the Divine Lady and then framed me for Daoting … I have to say, this guy's move is very vicious! "
The True Martial God said, "If he really killed her, isn't he afraid of the Dao Tomb finding out?"
Bai Dizi said, "That proves that this person is not simple!
He dared to kill the Divine Lady at a time like this. What courage! "
The True Martial God looked at Bai Dizi. "You seem to value Ye Xuan a lot!"
Bai Dizi said seriously, "True Martial, don't underestimate this person. He is not only strong, but his intelligence is also rare. Judging from this matter, the Daoting and the Dao Tomb could have made peace temporarily. But now that the Divine Lady is dead, it is impossible for us to make peace.
Most importantly, Ye Xuan has become the son-in-law of the Dao Tomb, and he is fighting for the revenge of the Divine Lady!
Goddess, come and find my Dao Court with the slogan of revenge!
He wanted to destroy the Daoting for the Fifth Dimension Tendo and the Fifth Dimension Universe, but now … his slogan has changed. Things are completely different!
Because he will have the support of the Dao Tomb!
If he wants to avenge the Five-Dimensional Screen of the Universe, the Land of the Dao Burial Mound will not support him. Maybe they will sit on the sidelines and watch us fight against Ye Xuan. But now, he wants to avenge the Goddess. The Land of the Dao Burial Mound will not support him! "
The True Martial God was silent.
The White Emperor's son continued, "As far as I know, this person has already obtained the Dao Scripture of that person from the Underworld. He now has five Dao Scriptures on him, but he made a false accusation, saying that not only did my Dao Court kill the Goddess, but I also obtained the Dao Scripture.
Think about it, what will the Dao Tomb do now?
They will fight us at all costs.
The current situation is not good for the Dao Tomb! "
The True Martial God suddenly said, "Can we kill this person?"
Bai Dizi was silent.
The True Martial God looked at Bai Dizi. "Can't we?"
Bai Dizi said softly, "I'm afraid it will be difficult!
The Dao Ancestor personally attacked once in the Daoting, but he was stopped by a mysterious woman. I, the Daoting, have not been able to find out the true identity of that mysterious woman! "
A trace of worry flashed in his eyes. "This Ye Xuan is not as simple as he looks. I have studied him for so long, but I have not found out the force behind him …"
The True Martial God frowned. "The force behind him?"
Bai Dizi nodded. "There must be a powerful force behind him, but I, the Daoting, cannot find out who this force is!
The only thing we can find is two points. First, the woman in the plain dress. She seems to be Ye Xuan's Path Protector, but we cannot find out where she is now.
Other than that, there is also the power of his bloodline!
His bloodline is extremely powerful, but I have never heard of a bloodline that can make people go crazy … "
At this point, he looked at the White Emperor's son. "Regardless of whether it is the woman in the plain dress or the source of his bloodline, they are not simple at all. As for these people, their presence is too inconspicuous. Even if they occasionally make a move, they are always instant kills. Thus, I have no way of knowing their true strength.
In short, I, the Daoting, cannot underestimate Ye Xuan. His threat is no weaker than the Dao Tomb! "
The True Martial God slowly closed his eyes. "It is indeed not easy to obtain the five Dao Scriptures."
Bai Dizi said softly, "Previously, I suggested a temporary ceasefire because I wanted to get rid of Ye Xuan first. However, I did not expect Ye Xuan to go to the Dao Tomb and the Goddess to die!"
As he spoke, he sighed softly. "At the bottom of it all, it's my fault. I never imagined that Niannian would actually be so powerful, and I greatly underestimated her. If it wasn't for that, my Dao Court wouldn't have fallen into such a passive situation."
Mu Niannian!
The True Martial God's eyes flashed with seriousness.
That woman only used 30% of her strength to destroy the Dao Ancestor's body. If she used all her strength, who in the Daoting could be her opponent?
The hall suddenly fell into silence.
In fact, Bai Dizi was still afraid.
If it was not for Mu Niannian wanting to protect the Fifth Dimension, that woman could have destroyed the Daoting. After all, the Dao Tomb was still there.
Fortunately, that woman's main goal was to protect the Fifth Dimension.
At this time, the True Martial God suddenly frowned. "I have just received news that Ye Xuan has arrived at the Heaven Abyss."
Just as White Emperor was about to speak, a furious roar suddenly resounded from outside the palace. "Bastards from the Dao Court, how dare you kill the Goddess of my Dao Tomb. Why aren't all of you coming to die?"
It was Ye Xuan's voice!
Hearing Ye Xuan's words, Bai Dizi's face twitched. He could not help but curse. "How shameless!"
.....









Chapter 1359
Inside the palace.
Bai Dizi suddenly looked at True Martial Divine Lord. "Kill this person!"
True Martial Divine Lord nodded and disappeared from the palace with his sword.
But soon, he came back.
Bai Dizi was stunned. "What happened?"
True Martial Divine Lord was expressionless. "He left!"
Left?
Bai Dizi's face darkened. "He came and cursed before leaving?"
True Martial Divine Lord nodded.
Bai Dizi was silent.
True Martial Divine Lord gripped his sword tightly with his right hand. "Can he really devour swords?"
Bai Dizi nodded. "Yes."
True Martial Divine Lord asked, "Is it a problem with his constitution or something else?"
Bai Dizi said in a low voice, "It might be a problem with his constitution!
His constitution is a bit special! "
True Martial Divine Lord nodded. "I understand!"
Then, he looked at Bai Dizi. "This person's purpose in coming to Heaven Abyss should be to make Daoting and the Land of Dao fight to the death. The more intense our fight, the better it is for him. So, we can't let him have his way. Come with me to see Luo Hou!"
Bai Dizi nodded. "Okay!"
After saying that, the two of them disappeared.
...
Ye Xuan wanted to kill a few people before leaving, but he suddenly felt danger!
He didn't choose to take the risk and left decisively!
Although he was strong now, he wasn't invincible.
Not long after Ye Xuan left Heaven Palace, a man in black suddenly appeared in front of him. The man in black said in a hoarse voice, "Luo Hou wants to see you!"
Luo Hou!
The current boss of the Land of Dao in Dual World Abyss!
Ye Xuan nodded. "Okay!"
The man in black turned and left.
Ye Xuan followed.
Soon, Ye Xuan followed the man in black to an ancient city. The ancient city stood in the starry sky and was extremely spectacular.
Dao Tomb City!
As soon as he approached the city, Ye Xuan felt countless powerful auras!
At this moment, Ye Xuan's expression was unprecedentedly solemn.
At this moment, he clearly felt the difference between the Fifth Dimension and the Daoting Dao Tomb.
The difference wasn't just a little big!
Ye Xuan followed the black-clothed man to a large hall. After entering the hall, the black-clothed man quietly retreated.
Ye Xuan looked up and saw a middle-aged man standing not far in front of him. The middle-aged man wore a long black robe and had long hair that draped over his shoulders. At his waist was a strangely shaped blade.
Rahu!
Ye Xuan realized that he couldn't sense the existence of this person in front of him at all!
Luo Hou suddenly said, "Show yourselves!"
As soon as he finished speaking, Bai Dizi and True Martial God appeared in the hall.
Both of them did not come with their true bodies, but rather with their illusions!
Bai Dizi looked at Ye Xuan. "Young Master Ye, we meet again!"
Ye Xuan was expressionless. He didn't speak, but he was secretly thinking about what might happen next.
Luo Hou looked at True Martial God. "True Martial, I believe the two of you are here for Young Master Ye!
If you have something to say, just say it!
We are all quite busy! "
True Martial Divine Lord looked at Luo Hou. "Luo Hou, do you think Goddess was killed by me, Dao Ting?"
Luo Hou was expressionless. "You have to ask Daoting!"
True Martial God smiled. "Luo Hou, you and I have fought for nearly a thousand years. You should know my personality. I, True Martial, disdain doing such things!"
Luo Hou was silent.
Ye Xuan suddenly spoke.
"Dao Scripture!"
Hearing this, Luo Hou looked at Ye Xuan. Ye Xuan said, "I believe that True Martial God disdains doing such things. However, just because you don't do it doesn't mean others won't do it!"
As he said this, he pointed at Bai Dizi. "For example, you!"
Bai Dizi looked at Ye Xuan. "What do you mean?"
Ye Xuan looked emotionless. "The True Martial Arts Divine Lord is a real strong man. Even if such a strong man has done something sneaky, he will have the nerve to admit it. However, not everyone is like the True Martial Arts Divine Lord!
White Emperor Star Lord, in order to destroy my Fifth Dimension, what tricks have you not used? "
Bai Dizi smiled. "But I don't have the strength to go to the Dao Tomb to kill people!"
Ye Xuan said, "Can't you send someone?
Do you lack experts for Daoting? "
Bai Dizi looked at Ye Xuan. "I've long heard that Young Master Ye is good at distorting the truth. Now that I've seen it for myself, you really live up to your reputation!"
Ye Xuan slowly closed his eyes. "What? Daoting killed someone and stole the Dao Scripture, but you don't dare to admit it?
Or do you want to put the blame on me and say that I, Ye Xuan, killed someone? "
Bai Dizi sneered. "Is that not possible?"
Ye Xuan shook his head and smiled. "White Emperor Star Lord, I thank you. Thank you for thinking so highly of me!"
Bai Dizi didn't care about Ye Xuan. He looked at Luo Hou. "Luo Hou, don't you think there's something fishy about this?"
Luo Hou's expression was calm. "There's something fishy!
That's why I asked you to discuss it!
You said that the person was killed by this Young Master Ye. Do you have any evidence? "
Bai Dizi said, "But he doesn't have any evidence to prove that I, Daoting, killed him!"
Ye Xuan said, "Besides you, Daoting, who else could it be?"
Bai Dizi looked at Ye Xuan. "Don't I still have you?"
Ye Xuan said, "What reason do I have to kill the Goddess?
Or should I say, do I have the ability to kill the Goddess silently? "
Bai Dizi smiled. "It's because all the signs show that it's not you that it's most likely you!"
Ye Xuan was expressionless. "According to your logic, can I say that all the signs show that I'm not your father, and I'm most likely to be your father?"
Bai Dizi frowned. "Manners?"
Ye Xuan spread out his hands. "Manners are for people. In my opinion, you, Daoting people are not human."
Bai Dizi frowned. "Ye Xuan, you're also a person. Can't you have the demeanor of a strong person?"
"Demeanor of a strong person?"
Ye Xuan said fiercely, "You killed my newly married wife, and you want me to talk about demeanor of a strong person with you?
You guys are really funny! "
Bai Dizi said in a deep voice, "I, Daoting, did not kill the Goddess!"
Ye Xuan said angrily, "Then who killed her?"
Bai Dizi was a little angry. "You're asking me, but who should I ask?"
Ye Xuan stared at Bai Dizi. "Then you killed her!"
Bai Dizi was so angry that he wanted to hit him!
Damn it, this guy is making a scene!
At this time, True Martial Divine Lord suddenly said, "As far as I know, Young Master Ye and the Goddess met not long ago. As soon as the Goddess died, Young Master Ye swore to avenge her. Young Master Ye, don't you think you're going a little too far?
Or is it because you have a guilty conscience? "
Hearing this, Luo Hou looked at Ye Xuan.
Ye Xuan said, "The Goddess likes me!"
True Martial Divine Lord was speechless.
Bai Dizi sneered. "Likes you?
Why does she like you? "
Ye Xuan looked at Bai Dizi. "Why doesn't she like me?
Bai Dizi, it's not that I, Ye Xuan, want to boast, but among the younger generation of Daoting, is there anyone more handsome than me?
Oh, no, is there anyone better than me? "
Bai Dizi stared at Ye Xuan and did not speak.
There really wasn't anyone!
Don't talk about Daoting.
There wasn't anyone in the Dao Tomb!
Ye Xuan spread his hands. "Since ancient times, beauties love heroes. I am so outstanding, so what if the Goddess likes me?
Let me ask you, what's wrong? "
Bai Dizi's expression became uglier.
Ye Xuan said, "There is one more thing. The Goddess took the initiative to go to the Fifth Dimension to propose to me!
The Goddess took the initiative, not me, Ye Xuan!
White Emperor Star Lord, True Martial Divine Lord, have you never been pursued by a woman? "
Bai Dizi looked at Ye Xuan and did not speak.
True Martial Divine Lord looked at Ye Xuan. "Do you like the Goddess?"
Ye Xuan's expression was calm. "Is it important whether I like her or not?"
True Martial Divine Lord frowned. "Isn't it important?"
Ye Xuan spread his hands. "I don't think it's important. In my opinion, the Goddess is beautiful enough to be with me, Ye Xuan. Since she likes me, what's wrong with sleeping with her?
What's wrong? "
Divine Lord True Martial was dumbfounded when he heard that.
Bai Dizi also looked at Ye Xuan in disbelief. Was this something a human could say?
Was this something a human could say?
Luo Hou couldn't help but look at Ye Xuan.
At this time, Ye Xuan suddenly said, "Can't a man have more women?
Moreover, after I marry the Goddess, I can borrow the power of the Dao Tomb to resist Daoting. Why wouldn't I do it? "
Bai Dizi shook his head. "Shameless scumbag!
It's her misfortune that the Goddess likes you! "
Ye Xuan sneered. "I, Ye Xuan, dare to take responsibility for what I do. I, Ye Xuan, dare to admit that I married the Goddess not only because she's beautiful, but also because I want to use the Dao Tomb to resist Daoting. This is my goal. I, Ye Xuan, dare to admit it!"
Luo Hou looked at Ye Xuan. He didn't have a good impression of Ye Xuan, but he had to admit that Ye Xuan dared to take responsibility for what he did and dared to admit it. In this aspect, Ye Xuan was much better than most people!
At this time, Ye Xuan said, "I don't have a deep relationship with the Goddess, but since she's married to me, she belongs to me, Ye Xuan. Since she was killed by you, shouldn't I avenge her?
Moreover, you also stole my Dao Scripture! "
Of course, from Ye Xuan's words, Ye Xuan also gained a piece of information. That was, he, Ye Xuan, was married to the Goddess, and there was no harm at all. In this case, how stupid would he be to kill the Goddess?
Dao Scripture!
Luo Hou collected his thoughts and looked at Bai Dizi and True Martial Divine Lord.
Bai Dizi said in a deep voice, "Ye Xuan, don't slander us. We didn't kill the Goddess, and we didn't steal your Dao Scripture!"
Ye Xuan suddenly said fiercely, "Then who was it?"
Bai Dizi was also a little angry. "How would I know who it was …"
At this point, he suddenly realized something and stopped.
Didn't he just insist that it was Ye Xuan?
Ye Xuan sneered and didn't say anything.
Bai Dizi looked at Ye Xuan. "Young Master Ye, you really aren't simple!"
Ye Xuan turned to Luo Hou. "Senior Luo Hou, I don't want to talk to them anymore. They killed the Goddess and stole the Dao Scripture!
Now, I just want to fight them to the death and sacrifice half of my soul in heaven! "
Then, he turned around and left with his sword.
Luo Hou frowned. "Where are you going?"
Outside the hall, Ye Xuan didn't look back. "I'm going to the Heavenly Palace to fight them to the death!"
Soon, he disappeared into the distance.
Inside the hall, True Martial Divine Lord looked at Bai Dizi. "You really didn't send anyone to kill the Goddess?"
Bai Dizi: "…"
....
PS: I'm so handsome, can't you vote for me?









Chapter 1360
Bai Dizi was infuriated by True Martial Divine Lord's words.
Seeing White Emperor's expression, True Martial Divine Lord said softly, "Looking at him, even I suspect that we killed the Goddess … What about the Dao Tomb?
Let's go! "
After saying that, he disappeared with White Emperor's son.
Inside the palace, Luo Hou was expressionless.
Suddenly, a voice came from inside the palace. "Luo Hou, do you believe him?"
Luo Hou shook his head. "No. But he had no reason to kill Banzhi. He couldn't have killed Banzhi in an instant.
This matter is very strange. Dai Ye, go and investigate it. "
The voice said, "Yes!"
Inside the palace, Luo Hou slowly closed his eyes.
Ye Xuan!
In fact, he had also suspected Ye Xuan.
But why did Ye Xuan kill Banzhi?
Ye Xuan had no motive to kill.
But Daoting did!
Suddenly, a voice came from inside the palace. "He really went to the Heavenly Palace!"
Luo Hou said softly, "Could it really be Daoting?"
....
Heavenly Palace.
Ye Xuan stood there with his sword in hand. In front of him stood more than a dozen strong people, all of whom were at the peak Dao Proving Realm!
And in the dark, he felt the presence of at least a dozen Dao Defense Cultivators!
Then, Bai Dizi appeared in front of Ye Xuan. Bai Dizi looked at Ye Xuan. "Ye Xuan, you really came!"
Ye Xuan smiled. "Surprised?"
Bai Dizi looked at Ye Xuan. "You are the most shameless person I have ever seen!"
Ye Xuan said softly, "Living is the most important thing!"
The White Emperor smiled and said, "You dared to come here alone, so you must have thought that the Dao Tomb would help you, right?"
Ye Xuan looked at Bai Dizi. "What do you think?"
Bai Dizi narrowed his eyes, "We won't give them the chance to help!"
Suddenly, Ye Xuan looked at Sky Palace. "I've long heard that True Martial God's Sword Doctrine is superb. Today, Ye Xuan would like to challenge you to a one-on-one, fair fight!"
A fair fight!
When they heard this, the experts of the Dao Palace who were about to attack in secret stopped in succession.
Bai Dizi's brows knit together slightly, and he was just about to speak when a ray of light suddenly resounded from within the palace. In the next moment, an enormous golden sword shot into the sky from within the palace, and then it slashed directly at Ye Xuan!
True Martial Divine Sword!
True Martial God took action himself!
Obviously, Emperor True Martial had accepted Ye Xuan's challenge.
Ye Xuan raised his head and looked at the sword. The sword light was like lightning, causing the starry sky to tremble.
The realm of this sword was above his!
Ye Xuan suddenly took a step forward, and then he thrust his sword forward.
Chi!
The sword directly pierced the sword light.
Bang!
Ye Xuan retreated a thousand feet in an instant!
Meanwhile, a middle aged man appeared not too far away from Ye Xuan.
It was True Martial God!
True Martial God gazed at Ye Xuan, "The sword has changed, and it contains the Grand Dao within it …. In the younger generation, you're number one in the Sword Doctrine!"
Ye Xuan smiled, "If True Martial God wants to kill me, then you can ask all the experts in the surroundings to attack together. In that way, I, Ye Xuan, will definitely die!"
Bai Dizi suddenly said, "Attack together!"
He knew that this was the best time to kill Ye Xuan.
If all the experts attacked together, then not to mention Ye Xuan, even Rahu would definitely die here.
However, no one attacked!
Bai Dizi gazed at True Martial God, and True Martial God said, "I'll fight him fairly!"
Bai Dizi spoke solemnly, "True Martial, you …."
True Martial God, you … "
True Martial God looked at Bai Dizi, "I, the Daoting, may be able to kill him today, but we will become the laughingstock of the Dao Tomb!
Also, do we need to attack together to kill a young man? "
Bai Dizi understood.
Aura!
Not everyone knew how powerful Ye Xuan was. If they chose to attack Ye Xuan now, it would mean that they were not confident and would weaken the Daoting's power.
After all, Ye Xuan was challenging True Martial God, and he was challenging someone stronger than him.
Under such circumstances, if the Daoting chose to attack together, what would that mean?
Most of the people in the Daoting were the Grand Dao Guardians, and they were all arrogant.
White Emperor sighed softly and did not say anything else.
He was a civil servant in the Daoting, and he could not understand the thoughts and actions of the martial artists, but he had to respect them.
The strong had their own pride!
Especially now, aura was very important to the Daoting.
Bai Dizi retreated to the side.
True Martial God looked at Ye Xuan. "Draw your sword!"
Ye Xuan nodded and suddenly disappeared.
Psst!
A sword-light tore through the field.
In the distance, True Martial God suddenly drew his sword and slashed. It was a powerful slash with the power of thunder.
Boom!
Ye Xuan's sword-light was shattered. At the same time, a powerful sword force pushed Ye Xuan hundreds of meters away. As soon as Ye Xuan stopped, the starry space around him exploded!
His body had withstood True Martial God's power, but the space he was in could not!
Ye Xuan wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth. His eyes were full of fighting spirit!
After reaching the Doctrine Realm, he wanted to fight to his heart's content. He wanted to use his sword alone, without the power of his Bloodline or killing intent!
Ye Xuan slowly closed his eyes, and the Executing Heaven Sword in his hand began to vibrate.
In the distance, True Martial God suddenly took a step forward. With one step, he was in front of Ye Xuan, and he stabbed at Ye Xuan.
This sword strike was like a sudden clap of thunder, so fast that it was impossible to cover one's ears.
The sword suddenly stopped a few meters away from Ye Xuan.
Sword Realm!
Under the Sword Realm, the sword's speed was suppressed.
Suddenly, Sir True Martial took another step forward.
Psst!
Something in the sword intent seemed to be torn apart.
Ye Xuan's face instantly turned pale, and he thrust his sword out at the same time.
The sword changed!
There were thousands of changes in one sword.
This was his own Sword Dao!
Boom!
As soon as the two swords touched, Ye Xuan's Sword Realm disappeared, and he retreated hundreds of meters. Before he could stop, True Martial God appeared in front of him again. This time, True Martial God did not stab. Instead, he slashed with his sword.
As the sword slashed down, it was as if thousands of horses and soldiers were galloping over with unstoppable momentum!
Facing the sword, Ye Xuan did not choose to face it head-on. Instead, he blocked it with his sword.
Boom!
In an instant, Ye Xuan retreated hundreds of meters. As he retreated, True Martial God suddenly took a step forward. With this step, he appeared in front of Ye Xuan. The next moment, he slashed with his sword.
Psst!
The sword slashed, and the space was torn open.
It was a very simple diagonal flick, without any fancy movements!
This time, Ye Xuan did not dodge. Instead, he stabbed at True Martial God's chest.
A life for a life!
However, at that moment, the sword in True Martial God's hand suddenly changed its stance.
The sword slashed at Ye Xuan's Executing Heaven Sword.
Clang!
Ye Xuan's Executing Heaven Sword shook violently and almost flew out of Ye Xuan's hand. At the same time, True Martial God slashed forward.
The slash seemed to shatter the starry sky. It was terrifying!
At that moment, Ye Xuan disappeared into thin air.
Space Dao Law!
As soon as Ye Xuan disappeared, the sword in the True Martial God's hand suddenly stopped. Then he swung his sword to the right.
Boom!
A sword light shattered, and a figure retreated rapidly from that area of space, retreating a distance of three thousand feet with each step!
The True Martial God looked at Ye Xuan. "I've been in the Heaven Abyss for a thousand years, and I've been fighting for a thousand years. I've met all kinds of opponents, and I've almost died countless times.
You have a lot of combat experience, but you're like a child in front of me.
If you think you can beat me with combat skills, I can tell you that you're dreaming! "
In the distance, Ye Xuan was silent.
At that moment, he realized another problem!
He had a serious lack of combat experience!
In the Fifth Dimension, his combat experience was naturally top-notch. However, in Celestial Abyss, Ye Xuan's combat experience and combat skills were like that of a child's!
From the start of the fight until now, he felt powerless. He felt like he was being controlled by his opponent. It was as if his opponent knew his next move!
Consciousness suppression!
Once he was suppressed, all moves were useless.
At that moment, Bai Dizi suddenly looked at True Martial God and sent him a Xuan Qi transmission. "Don't hold back!"
True Martial God nodded. He naturally understood what it meant to be a disaster!
Although Ye Xuan in front of him could not defeat him, Ye Xuan was still very young!
To be able to reach such a level at such a young age, this was extremely terrifying!
Thinking of this, True Martial God suddenly looked at Ye Xuan. The next moment, he disappeared. The next moment, a destructive sword light slashed toward Ye Xuan like a storm.
The power of this sword was enough to destroy the entire starry sky, let alone Ye Xuan!
However, the power of this sword was contained in the sword light. The surrounding starry sky was unharmed!
However, Ye Xuan, who was far away, did not dodge at all. He just let the sword strike his body.
Boom!
Under everyone's shocked gazes, Ye Xuan directly absorbed the sword light!
He absorbed it!
Bai Dizi stared at Ye Xuan. In fact, he was very curious. What kind of physique did Ye Xuan have?
He could even absorb True Martial God's sword energy?
Damn, wasn't this physique too abnormal?
Invincible among Swordsman?
Next to him, True Martial God whispered, "You can really devour sword energy!"
Ye Xuan greedily took a deep breath. He had to admit that True Martial God's sword was very nourishing!
In the distance, True Martial God suddenly disappeared. In the distance, Ye Xuan's pupils shrank. He held his sword with both hands and slashed forward.
A ray of sword light appeared in front of Ye Xuan like a crescent moon!
He did not choose to absorb it because this time, True Martial God did not use his sword. He used everything!
At this moment, a powerful force suddenly pierced the crescent moon-like sword light.
Boom!
Ye Xuan's sword light instantly shattered. At the same time, True Martial God punched Ye Xuan in the chest. However, the sword in Ye Xuan's hand had become the Soul Suppressing Sword. The moment he flew out, he stabbed the sword into True Martial God's chest.
Boom!
Ye Xuan retreated thousands of feet in an instant, and his Soul Suppressing Sword stabbed into True Martial Divine Lord's chest …
..









Chapter 1361
The Soul Suppressing Sword!
The moment the Soul Suppressing Sword pierced True Martial Divine Lord's chest, a powerful soul power enveloped him. However, the Soul Suppressing Sword that had always been successful failed at this moment.
The Soul Suppressing Sword couldn't suppress True Martial Divine Lord's soul!
Sensing this, Ye Xuan was shocked. He opened his palm, and the Soul Suppressing Sword flew back into his hand.
In the distance, True Martial Divine Lord looked at Ye Xuan. "A Dao Controlling Realm sword!"
Ye Xuan's expression grew serious.
He didn't expect the Soul Suppressing Sword to be ineffective against his opponent!
True Martial Divine Lord looked at Ye Xuan. "Are you curious why I'm fine?"
Ye Xuan asked, "Are you a soul cultivator?"
True Martial Divine Lord shook his head. "I'm not a soul cultivator, but my soul is a Battle Soul!"
Ye Xuan frowned. "Battle Soul?"
True Martial Divine Lord nodded. "I've been fighting in the Celestial Abyss for a thousand years. My soul has long become a Battle Soul. Do you know what a Battle Soul is?"
Ye Xuan shook his head.
True Martial Divine Lord walked slowly toward Ye Xuan. "A Battle Soul is a state, a spirit.
Even if my body is destroyed, my fighting spirit is not extinguished, and my soul is not dead. I can continue to fight!
My soul is immortal, and my fighting spirit is eternal. This is a Battle Soul! "
Ye Xuan whispered, "I underestimated you!"
He knew that if he wanted to defeat this person, he had to defeat him with strength!
True Martial Divine Lord stopped and looked at Ye Xuan. "You have a God's Seal. That means you are a Great Dao Guardian too!"
Ye Xuan smiled. "Yes!"
True Martial Divine Lord was silent for a moment, then turned to look at Bai Dizi.
Bai Dizi knew what True Martial Divine Lord meant. After a moment of silence, he said, "He has Dao scriptures!"
The True Martial Divine Sovereign slowly closed his eyes and sent a voice transmission with profound energy. "Bai Dizi is a genius. Not only is he extremely talented, but he's even more ruthless. If I let him come here and train him for ten years, he will definitely be able to shoulder the heavy responsibility of guarding the Celestial Abyss.
The person who was supposed to be a pillar of my Daoting has now become the mortal enemy of my Daoting. "
Bai Dizi shook his head. "I had the same idea when I was investigating him, but I couldn't recruit him because he killed the Sixth Princess!
Just because of this, it's impossible for him to enter my Daoting! "
Divine Lord True Martial's expression turned cold. "Don't you know what that woman is like?
She only had herself to blame for her death.
Let alone outsiders, even I want to kill her! "
Bai Dizi smiled wryly.
In fact, he didn't like that woman either. Not only was she willful, but she was also brainless and caused trouble every day. This time, she had kicked an iron plate. Not only had she kicked an iron plate, but she had also caused Mu Niannian to injure a Dao Ancestor.
The reason why the Daoting was in such a passive position was all because of that woman!
But it couldn't be helped. Her identity was there, and Mu Niannian hadn't shown that he was that strong.
At that time, even Bai Dizi had chosen to protect the Sixth Princess without hesitation!
Of course, if he had known how terrifying Mu Niannian was, he might have solved the matter in a different way!
But there were no ifs in the world!
In the distance, True Martial Divine Lord said, "Bai Dizi, have you ever thought about why the Daoting has been declining since the beginning?"
Bai Dizi was silent.
True Martial Divine Lord said, "Is it because of the Dao Breakers?
No, it's because there's a problem with those of us who guard the Dao.
Many of us have started to go against the original intentions of the Three Thousand Dao.
The Dao is not fair. There will be Dao Breakers in the world. "
Bai Dizi shook his head. "True Martial, you know how difficult it is to reform the Daoting from the inside!
Especially now that the Dao Tomb is here. If we want to change, we will be doomed eternally! "
True Martial Divine Lord said softly, "I used to fight for the Dao, for my beliefs, but now …"
Bai Dizi's expression changed. "True Martial, you can't think like that!
Every force will have problems. The Daoting has problems. We have to think about how to change, not be disappointed.
You know, when the Dao Ancestor took over the Daoting, the Daoting was already in a mess. He thought the same as us. He wanted to change the Daoting.
But now, we are facing a bigger problem, and that is the Dao Breakers!
It's not a good time to attack the Daoting. "
True Martial Divine Lord slowly closed his eyes.
Bai Dizi said, "I believe it will get better, although the process might be a little painful!"
True Martial Divine Lord said softly, "The Daoting will get better!"
With that, he looked at Ye Xuan in the distance. "It's a pity to kill you, but I have no choice but to kill you!"
As soon as he finished speaking, he suddenly vanished on the spot.
In the distance, Ye Xuan suddenly slashed with his sword!
Boom!
A wave of sword-light suddenly erupted. In an instant, Ye Xuan retreated.
As he retreated, the sword in Ye Xuan's hand suddenly turned into a sword-light and flew out.
In the distance, True Martial Divine Lord punched.
Boom!
Ye Xuan's sword was sent flying by True Martial Divine Lord's punch!
The moment the sword flew out, True Martial Divine Lord appeared in front of Ye Xuan. Ye Xuan was about to attack when a mysterious power suddenly enveloped him!
Battle Domain!
Domain!
Ye Xuan was shocked. He hadn't expected that True Martial Divine Lord actually possessed a Battle Domain.
A strand of powerful battle intent locked onto Ye Xuan.
Battle intent!
At this moment, Ye Xuan sensed True Martial Divine Lord's powerful battle intent.
It was so strong that he'd never seen it before!
Ye Xuan didn't dare hold back when facing such an expert, and he immediately utilized four Domains.
Slaughter Domain!
Sword Domain!
Death Domain!
Blood Domain!
As soon as the four Domains appeared, True Martial Divine Lord's battle intent was instantly suppressed. Meanwhile, Ye Xuan suddenly slashed down from within the Sword Domain.
True Martial Divine Lord didn't retreat, and he smashed his fist forward instead!
It was a head-on collision!
The force of his fist was extremely domineering!
Bang!
A world shaking explosion resounded abruptly, and then a figure retreated repeatedly!
It was Ye Xuan!
However, Bai Dizi's expression had become slightly solemn!
Because True Martial Divine Lord had retreated by over 10m as well!
It wasn't just Bai Dizi, the Daoting experts here were quite shocked as well!
Four Domains!
It was extremely difficult for ordinary people to comprehend even one Domain!
However, Ye Xuan had actually comprehended four!
True Martial Divine Lord glanced at Ye Xuan and spoke softly, "Four Domains!"
Ye Xuan wiped off the blood from the corners of his mouth. Needless to say, True Martial Divine Lord was really strong. Even his four Domains weren't able to suppress True Martial Divine Lord!
The killing intent in True Martial Divine Lord's eyes grew stronger!
Now, he was starting to fear Ye Xuan!
If this young man were to mature, then he would definitely become an extremely terrifying existence!
True Martial Divine Lord suddenly vanished on the spot when he thought up to this point.
Bang!
In the blink of an eye, a force capable of destroying the heavens and the earth swept through the battlefield!
At this moment, the entire starry sky trembled!
This time, True Martial Divine Lord had utilized a killer move!
Everything was obliterated beneath his fist!
In the distance.
Ye Xuan slowly closed his eyes.
He knew that his strength was far inferior to True Martial Divine Lord's.
However, he wasn't afraid!
There was only excitement in his heart!
Fight!
As if sensing Ye Xuan's fighting spirit, the Executing Heaven Sword trembled violently. Sword hums reverberated throughout the starry sky.
When True Martial Divine Lord arrived in front of Ye Xuan, Ye Xuan suddenly opened his eyes. He charged forward and slashed down with his sword!
One sword to decide life and death!
He wasn't as strong as Qing 'er, so he couldn't really decide life and death with one sword. However, he had the determination to decide life and death!
Under this sword, if one of them didn't die, one of them would die!
When a person wasn't afraid of death, that was when he was at his bravest.
The power of this sword could be said to be his strongest sword under normal circumstances!
However, reality was cruel.
As Ye Xuan's sword fell, he was sent flying backward in an instant. He was sent flying thousands of feet away. While he was flying backward, every inch of space was destroyed!
However, True Martial Divine Lord had also retreated dozens of feet. Compared to Ye Xuan, his situation was much better!
True Martial Divine Lord looked at Ye Xuan, the murderous intent in his eyes thickening!
In the beginning, he had cherished talent, but now he was truly afraid!
Although Ye Xuan couldn't defeat him, he wasn't proud at all. After all, he had lived for tens of thousands of years.
How old was Ye Xuan?
Under normal circumstances, a young man like Ye Xuan wouldn't even be qualified to fight him!
However, Ye Xuan had fought him for so long!
At this moment, Ye Xuan, who was in the distance, suddenly jumped up and slashed at the True Martial God!
He attacked first!
True Martial Divine Lord narrowed his eyes. The murderous intent in his eyes was almost tangible!
Defeat wasn't scary. What was scary was not having the guts to fight!
You could lose to your enemy, but you couldn't not have the guts to fight!
If you couldn't win, it was a matter of strength. As long as you didn't die, there would come a time when you could win.
But not having the guts to fight was a matter of state of mind!
The most terrifying thing about a man wasn't failure, but cowardice!
The moment Ye Xuan attacked first, True Martial Divine Lord knew Ye Xuan's temperament. That was why fear appeared in his eyes.
True Martial Divine Lord took a step forward. When his step landed, the stars trembled.
When Ye Xuan's sword landed, True Martial Divine Lord suddenly punched!
The moment the punch landed, the stars within tens of thousands of miles trembled!
Without a doubt, Ye Xuan was sent flying again. This time, he flew for thousands of feet. This time, Ye Xuan was in an even worse state than before. His body cracked. Moreover, the space where Ye Xuan stood collapsed!
The power of a single punch was so strong!
In the distance, Ye Xuan wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth. He looked up at True Martial Divine Lord again. A moment later, he disappeared again!
He attacked first again!
A ray of sword light flashed and tore through the stars.
In the distance, True Martial Divine Lord slowly clenched his right hand.
On the other side, the White Emperor's son frowned.
Was Ye Xuan courting death?
No!
Based on his understanding of Ye Xuan, Ye Xuan was definitely not a brainless fool!
So what was Ye Xuan doing now?
Or perhaps, he was playing some kind of trick again?
Bai Dizi's expression changed as if he thought of something. He looked at True Martial Divine Lord and said, "Kill him!
This guy is playing dirty! "
.....









Chapter 1362
He's playing dirty!
The moment the Son of the White Emperor's voice fell, Ye Xuan flew out again. At this time, before Ye Xuan could attack, the True Martial Divine Lord took the initiative to attack!
However, a man suddenly appeared in front of Ye Xuan as soon as the True Martial God made his move.
Luo Hou!
Bai Dizi's face darkened when he saw Luo Hou!
Luo Hou smiled. "True Martial, you're bullying the weak!"
True Martial Emperor looked at Luo Hou. "I'll explain one last time. I didn't send anyone to kill the Goddess."
Luo Hou shook his head. "It doesn't matter anymore!"
It didn't matter!
The True Martial God frowned slightly. Then, as if something had occurred to him, he suddenly turned his head to look at Ye Xuan, who was covered in wounds in the distance. "What a cunning plan!"
Luo Hou didn't say anything else. He walked in front of Ye Xuan and was about to leave with Ye Xuan when a powerful force locked him in place!
Luo Hou turned to look at True Martial Emperor. "Are we going to fight now?"
True Martial Emperor looked at Luo Hou. "For him?"
Luo Hou smiled. "If he was Daoting, would you fight against the Dao Tomb for him?"
True Martial Emperor was silent.
Because he would!
Luo Hou laughed and left with Ye Xuan.
True Martial Emperor slowly closed his eyes. His expression was gloomy.
At this time, White Thearch's son appeared next to True Martial God and said, "He is smarter than we thought!"
What was Ye Xuan's purpose in challenging True Martial Emperor?
To kill True Martial Emperor?
No!
Ye Xuan wasn't stupid. He knew he couldn't kill True Martial Emperor.
True Martial Emperor was the leader of the Stellar Lords. If Ye Xuan killed him, wouldn't that be a joke?
Ye Xuan's real purpose in challenging True Martial Emperor was to prove himself!
He wanted to prove to the Dao Tomb that he, Ye Xuan, was valuable!
Previously, there were rumors that Ye Xuan was a monster, but the Dao Tomb had no idea how strong he really was.
But now, the Dao Tomb knew.
This was what Rahu meant when he said that Daoting didn't kill the Goddess.
This was because the Dao Tomb was currently protecting Ye Xuan because Ye Xuan was valuable, not because of the Goddess.
When a person has value, others will be willing to invest in you!
To put it simply, although Ye Xuan was married to the Goddess, the Dao Tomb had not recognized Ye Xuan's identity. But now, the Dao Tomb had recognized him.
At least he admitted it on the surface!
That was how the world worked. You were valuable, and everything was friendly to you!
But if you had no value, your loved ones might dislike you!
In the battlefield, Bai Dizi said, "He knows that he can't compete with Daoting, so he must use the Dao Tomb … His actions will make it impossible for me and the Dao Tomb to make peace with the Dao Tomb, and we won't be able to deal with him and the Fifth Dimension."
Then, he slowly closed his eyes. "Not only that, as long as he is outstanding enough and remains an enemy of Daoting, even if the Dao Tomb knows that he killed the Goddess, the Dao Tomb will pretend that it doesn't know and will say that I killed him.
His value has already surpassed the Goddess! "
True Martial Emperor suddenly said softly, "The Dao Tomb will nurture him!"
Bai Dizi nodded. His expression was extremely ugly.
If Ye Xuan was nurtured by the Dao Tomb, it would be like adding wings to a tiger!
With this guy's talent, it wouldn't be long before even True Martial Emperor could kill him!
Bai Dizi shook his head and sighed.
Originally, he thought that after Mu Niannian's death, it would be much easier for Daoting to kill Ye Xuan. But now, things had become more troublesome.
Bai Dizi suddenly said, "Where is the white robe?"
True Martial Emperor said, "In the depths of Heaven Abyss!"
Bai Dizi said softly, "Tell him to come back!"
True Martial Emperor nodded and said softly, "Bai Dizi, go and ask for a decree. Tell all the experts of Daoting who are in seclusion to come out."
Bai Dizi's expression changed. "This …"
True Martial Emperor said softly, "Things will become more and more serious!"
Bai Dizi nodded. "I'll go right now!"
Then, he turned and left.
In the starry sky, True Martial Emperor looked into the depths of the starry sky with deep worry in his eyes.
...
Dao Tomb City.
In the room, Ye Xuan lay quietly. His injuries were rapidly recovering.
At this moment, Ye Xuan's mind was filled with the battle with True Martial Emperor!
From the beginning, he was suppressed in both strength and battle awareness!
At this moment, he deeply felt that he was severely lacking in battle experience!
True Martial Emperor hadn't reached Dao Attainment State, but he was completely different from other Dao Defensive State experts!
A Dao Defensive State expert who fought his way up was truly terrifying!
Challenging someone of a higher level also depended on the person!
At this moment, Ye Zhiming's voice suddenly sounded in Ye Xuan's mind. "What are your plans next?"
Ye Xuan said softly, "I'm not strong enough. I need to improve my strength!
And this place is just right for me to improve my strength! "
Ye Zhiming said in a low voice, "I can feel that True Martial Emperor wants to kill you. If you stay here, Daoting will definitely target you."
Ye Xuan nodded. "I know!"
Ye Zhiming wanted to say something but stopped.
Ye Xuan smiled. "Don't worry, Zhiming. I'll be careful."
Ye Zhiming sighed.
Right now, Ye Xuan was actually playing with fire. Neither Daoting nor the Land of Dao Tomb were easy targets. They wouldn't let Ye Xuan toy with them. One careless move and Ye Xuan would be doomed!
But Ye Xuan had no choice but to play like this!
Because in the current situation, if Ye Xuan didn't play like this, once Daoting and the Land of Dao Tomb reached some kind of agreement, Ye Xuan and the Five-Dimensional Universe would be doomed!
An hour later, Ye Xuan's injuries had completely recovered. He left his room. The Dao Tomb City was filled with powerful auras!
Here, the weakest experts were at the Self Release Realm. Moreover, they were truly at the Self Release Realm!
In addition to that, Ye Xuan also found that everyone in this place was giving off a fierce murderous aura!
These people were all battle-hardened!
The gap between the experts of the Five-Dimensional Universe and the Land of Dao Tomb and Daoting was not small, whether it was in terms of quantity or quality!
The Five-Dimensional Universe still had a long way to go!
Regardless, he, Ye Xuan, would continue to walk forward with the Five-Dimensional Universe!
At this time, a man suddenly appeared in front of Ye Xuan. This man was Tu Ming.
There were a few people beside Tu Ming, all at the Self Release Realm!
Tu Ming looked at Ye Xuan and didn't speak.
At this time, a man beside Tu Ming suddenly said, "Brother Tu Ming, is he the Ye Xuan who married the Goddess?"
Tu Ming nodded.
The man sized up Ye Xuan, and then he walked in front of Ye Xuan. The corners of his mouth curled up. "I heard that you went to challenge the True Martial Divine Lord?"
Ye Xuan nodded. "What's the matter?"
The man smiled. "If you were really that powerful, why would you need Marshal Luo Hou to save you?"
Ye Xuan suddenly slapped him.
Slap!
！
The man didn't even have time to react before he was sent flying by Ye Xuan's slap. He flew dozens of meters away!
Tu Ming and the others were stunned when they saw Ye Xuan suddenly attack. They quickly surrounded Ye Xuan. Tu Ming looked at Ye Xuan. "You do it!"
Ye Xuan looked coldly at Tu Ming and the others. "I'm going to challenge the True Martial Divine Lord. It's true that I haven't defeated him, but I dare to go!
Do you dare to go? "
The expressions of Tu Ming and the others were slightly unsightly.
Ye Xuan looked at Tu Ming and pointed at him. "Are you going?
You don't dare!
A bunch of cowards! "
With that, he turned around and left.
At this moment, the man who was sent flying suddenly rushed in front of Ye Xuan. He was about to speak when Ye Xuan suddenly slapped him.
Bang!
At this moment, the man was sent flying 300m away.
Beating up a Self Release Realm expert!
Tu Ming and the others were stunned!
Especially Tu Ming. He knew that Ye Xuan was very strong, but he didn't know how strong Ye Xuan was!
Ye Xuan suddenly walked in front of the man he'd slapped, and he stepped on the man's chest. "Looking for trouble with me?
Are you worthy? "
The man stared fixedly at Ye Xuan. "You dare to humiliate me!"
Ye Xuan suddenly slammed his fist against the man's face.
Bang!
The man's head exploded!
His soul was destroyed!
The expressions of Tu Ming and the others who were about to attack instantly stopped when they witnessed this scene!
Ye Xuan had killed someone!
They hadn't expected this at all!
The eyes of the man who'd been killed by Ye Xuan were open wide, and they were filled with disbelief.
He hadn't imagined that Ye Xuan would kill him as well!
Right at this moment, a powerful force suddenly enveloped Ye Xuan. Ye Xuan swiftly turned around and smashed his fist forward.
Bang!
A powerful force erupted in front of Ye Xuan, and Ye Xuan was instantly pushed over 100m back!
A middle aged man stood in front of Ye Xuan. The middle aged man wore a black robe, and his hands were hidden within his sleeves.
Tu Ming and the others hurriedly bowed respectfully when they saw the middle aged man, "Bitter King!"
Bitter King!
One of the four kings of the Dao Tomb, and he only obeyed Rahu!
Bitter King gazed at Ye Xuan, "Why did you kill him?"
Ye Xuan replied with a question, "Is it wrong for me to challenge the True Martial Divine Monarch?"
Bitter King frowned slightly, "I'm the one who asked you that question!"
Ye Xuan pointed at the young man's corpse, "He humiliated me first."
Bitter King turned to look at Tu Ming. Tu Ming hesitated for a moment before he told Bitter King about what had happened!
He naturally didn't dare conceal anything from Bitter King, so he didn't exaggerate.
A short moment later, Bitter King gazed at Ye Xuan, "He doesn't deserve death!"
Ye Xuan's face was expressionless, "I, Ye Xuan, hate bastards that are tough to their own people but weak to outsiders!"
As he spoke, he glanced at Tu Ming and the others, "So what if you bully your own people?
Go bully Daoting if you have the ability!
Let me ask all of you, do you dare to go Daoting with me now? "
Tu Ming and the others had slightly unsightly expressions when they heard this.
Bitter King suddenly said, "I've said it!
He doesn't deserve death! "
His voice was slightly stunned.
Ye Xuan looked at Bitter King, "Then what should we do? He's already dead!
Why don't I apologize to him? "
As he finished speaking, he turned to look at the young man's corpse and bowed, "I'm sorry, I killed you!
Please forgive me! "
Everyone, "…"
.....

Chapter 1363
Even though Bitter King's expression was calm as he gazed at Ye Xuan, everyone here felt a strand of invisible pressure descend upon them!
Ye Xuan gazed at Bitter King with an emotionless expression, "What? Do you intend to hit me?"
There wasn't even a trace of fear in his eyes.
Bitter King's eyes narrowed slightly while he slowly clenched his right fist. Meanwhile, Ye Xuan suddenly laughed with ridicule, "So this is the Dao Tomb!"
As soon as he finished speaking, he suddenly drew his sword and charged at Bitter King!
Tu Ming and the others were stunned when they witnessed this scene.
Has Ye Xuan gone mad?
He's actually attacking Bitter King!
Bitter King was quite stunned as well. Did this fellow attack me?
Bitter King didn't think too much about it and smashed his fist forward!
Bang!
Ye Xuan was blasted flying, and then he crashed heavily to the ground.
However, Ye Xuan immediately crawled up from the ground and charged at Bitter King again.
He's still going to fight!
Tu Ming and the others looked at each other. Was Ye Xuan out of his mind?
Meanwhile, more and more experts from the Dao Tomb had arrived in the surroundings.
All of their faces were covered in disbelief!
That's Bitter King!
Has Ye Xuan gone mad?
He's actually attacking Bitter King?
Ye Xuan charged over and over again, but he had no doubt that he wasn't a match for Bitter King at all.
However, Ye Xuan wasn't afraid at all, and he charged over and over again to fight Bitter King!
Tu Ming stared fixedly at Ye Xuan who was covered in injuries, "He's a madman!"
At this moment, he really was quite fearful of Ye Xuan!
After all, Ye Xuan is a madman!
Bang!
Meanwhile, Ye Xuan was blasted flying again!
Bitter King frowned slightly as he gazed at Ye Xuan, "Is there something wrong with you?"
Ye Xuan crawled up from the ground, wiped off the blood on the corner of his mouth, and then spoke fiercely, "Continue!"
As soon as he finished speaking, he charged at Bitter King again.
Chi!
A ray of sword light tore through the battlefield!
In the distance, Bitter King frowned slightly and punched out once more!
At this moment, the four mysterious powers suddenly suppressed Bitter King.
Four Domains!
Being suppressed by the four domains, Bitter King's eyes turned serious. He punched out.
Boom!
Ye Xuan was sent flying again, but Bitter King was also pushed back more than ten zhang!
At this moment, Ye Xuan appeared in front of Bitter King again. Bitter King reacted faster than him and punched again.
It was just a simple punch, nothing fancy.
And it was this simple punch that sent Ye Xuan flying again!
Dozens of feet away, Ye Xuan crawled out of the pit. Just as he was about to attack again, a man suddenly appeared in front of him.
Rahu!
Luo Hou looked at Ye Xuan. "Did you enjoy the fight?"
Ye Xuan didn't say anything.
Rahu glanced at the man's corpse and said, "He did need to be taught a lesson for looking for trouble. However, his crime doesn't deserve death. Weren't you a bit too vicious?"
Ye Xuan's face was expressionless. "I've already apologized!"
Rahu shook his head. "You killed someone and then apologized. You really are a genius!"
Ye Xuan was speechless.
Rahu suddenly said, "Come with me!"
As soon as he finished speaking, he walked towards the side.
Ye Xuan followed him, and so did Bitter King.
On the way, Rahu suddenly said, "You need comrades and friends in this place!
But you won't have any friends if you act like this! "
Ye Xuan wiped off the blood on the corner of his mouth. "Banzhi said that the Dao Tomb is very complicated. I don't want to be swept into such a vortex. I just want to kill the Daoting!"
Rahu glanced at Ye Xuan. "The Dao Tomb is very complicated, but you don't have to worry. In this Heaven Realm Abyss, no one dares to play dirty.
Here, everyone in the Dao Tomb will be united! "
Ye Xuan was silent.
Rahu continued, "Your biggest weakness now is that you lack battle experience. I want to send you to a place where there are battles every day, and they are battles of life and death."
Ye Xuan asked, "Where?"
Rahu said, "The Purgatory Battlefield!"
Ye Xuan frowned. "The Purgatory Battlefield?"
Rahu nodded. "Not only are there experts from the Dao Tomb, but there are also Daoting!
All the warmongers are there!
Over there, you can fight without fear!
As for Daoting, you don't have to worry. Zhen Wu and the others won't go there because it's a battlefield for the young!
Of course … "
As he spoke, he looked at Ye Xuan. "You might be an exception!
Daoting will kill you at all costs!
However, I will protect you in secret. If Daoting has experts like Zhen Wu, I will stop them! "
Ye Xuan nodded. "I'll go!"
What he needed the most right now was battle!
A crazy battle!
Rahu nodded. He opened his palm and lightly waved it in front of him. "Go in!"
Ye Xuan directly entered the spatial fissure.
After Ye Xuan left, Bitter King suddenly said, "The Goddess must be looking for him for the Dao Scripture!
The Dao Scripture … "
Rahu said softly, "It's in Daoting's hands!"
Bitter King looked at Rahu. Rahu was expressionless. "The Goddess was killed by Daoting. The Dao Scripture is also with Daoting!"
As he spoke, he turned and left.
On the spot, Bitter King finally understood.
In fact, Rahu suspected that Ye Xuan did it. He suspected it too. However, they had no evidence. But did they need evidence?
If they wanted to know if Ye Xuan did it, it was simple. They could capture Ye Xuan and find out the truth in countless ways.
However, Rahu did not do that!
Why?
Because Ye Xuan was valuable!
Rahu wanted to train Ye Xuan into a sword that could deal with Daoting. Moreover, the morale of the Dao Tomb had greatly increased because of the Goddess' death.
They were united against a common enemy!
Because Daoting had sent someone to kill the Goddess and steal the Dao Scripture, all the experts in the Dao Tomb were enraged!
It could be said that the Dao Tomb was now more united than before!
As for Ye Xuan, wasn't it better to let Ye Xuan fight Daoting to the death?
....
Daoting, Heavenly Palace.
In the palace, True Martial Divine Lord suddenly said, "He went to the Purgatory Battlefield!"
Bai Dizi looked at True Martial Divine Lord. "Are you sure?"
True Martial Divine Lord nodded.
The White Emperor's Son said softly, "It seems like the Dao Tomb wants to nurture him!"
True Martial Divine Lord nodded. "Not only is his Sword Dao outstanding, but he also has four kinds of Purgatory. His biggest weakness is his lack of battle experience. If he goes to that place, he can make up for this weakness.
Once he comes out … "
Bai Dizi looked at True Martial Divine Lord. "You do it!"
True Martial Divine Lord shook his head. "I can't. If I do, Rahu will attack immediately!
Moreover, we have a rule. That place is a battlefield for the younger generation. The older experts of both sides cannot participate! "
Bai Dizi was silent for a moment. "Inform all the younger generation of Daoting. Tell them to join forces and kill Ye Xuan at all costs!"
True Martial Divine Lord nodded. "Yes!"
At this moment, the White Emperor suddenly stood up, his face a little gloomy. "Those brats are all very arrogant. They will definitely look down on Ye Xuan!"
Hearing this, True Martial Divine Lord frowned.
He would not look down on Ye Xuan, but the younger generation of Daoting would definitely look down on him!
Once they looked down on Ye Xuan, it was tantamount to asking for death!
True Martial Divine Lord suddenly said, "Xi Ruo!"
As soon as he finished speaking, a woman suddenly entered the hall.
True Martial Divine Lord looked at Xi Ruo. "Go to the Purgatory Battlefield and tell Guan Shan not to underestimate him."
Then he paused and said, "Tell him that Ye Xuan can exchange a hundred moves with me without dying!"
Xi Ruo nodded. "Understood!"
Then she turned and left.
At this time, Bai Dizi suddenly said, "Wait!"
Xi Ruo looked at Bai Dizi. Bai Dizi said solemnly, "Tell Guan Shan to be careful of Ye Xuan. Not only is he strong, but he is also very good at all kinds of dirty tricks. Be careful when dealing with him. Don't fall for his tricks.
Also, if you meet him, don't talk about fair duels or morality. Beat him to death immediately. "
Xi Ruo looked at Bai Dizi. "White Emperor Star Lord, the more I say this, the more they will be unconvinced!"
Bai Dizi sighed. He felt helpless.
He knew that the younger generation of Daoting was also arrogant, and each one was more arrogant than the last!
But this Ye Xuan was not simple!
Dealing with Ye Xuan, if one was not careful, they would fall for his tricks!
Not to mention others, even he had a headache!
Xi Ruo suddenly said, "I will act according to the situation!"
True Martial God nodded. "Trust Xi Ruo!"
As he said this, he took out a token and gave it to Xi Ruo. "This is the True Martial Token. If necessary, use this token to order them around. Those who do not listen to you will be immediately expelled from Daoting and will never be hired again!"
Xi Ruo took the True Martial Token, bowed slightly, and then turned to leave.
Inside the hall, Bai Dizi slowly closed his eyes. "True Martial, do you think they can kill Ye Xuan?"
True Martial God was silent for a long time. Then he said softly, "If they unite and don't underestimate Ye Xuan, then they have an 80% chance!
But if they underestimate Ye Xuan and give Ye Xuan a chance … "
At this point, he didn't continue speaking.
At this time, Bai Dizi suddenly laughed. "Actually, it is not a bad thing!"
True Martial God looked at Bai Dizi. Bai Dizi smiled. "The younger generation of Daoting is the future of Daoting. These people need to grow.
This time, Ye Xuan is a training for them!
If they can kill Ye Xuan, then it proves that Daoting will prosper in the future. Even if they can't kill him, it doesn't matter. A failure can help them grow better. "
True Martial God nodded. "That makes sense!"
Bai Dizi said softly, "Then let us wait and see!"
...
After an unknown amount of time, Ye Xuan appeared in a mountain range. Behind him, the crack in space slowly closed.
Purgatory Battlefield!
Just as Ye Xuan entered Purgatory Battlefield, all the Daoting powerhouses in Purgatory Battlefield suddenly rushed towards Dao Mountain …
...









Chapter 1364
Dao Mountain!
Dao Mountain was the base of Daoting geniuses in the Purgatory Battlefield.
Originally, these Daoting geniuses were training in various places, but they suddenly received a call from Guan Mountain. Thus, they all rushed to Dao Mountain!
Somewhere in the mountains, Ye Xuan sat on the ground with a bonfire in front of him.
Grilling fish!
Ye Xuan quietly grilled fish, deep in thought.
After coming to the Purgatory Battlefield, he had been thinking about one thing!
If he was Daoting, what would he do?
He would definitely kill Ye Xuan!
There were only two ways for Daoting to kill him. First, True Martial God would act personally. If True Martial God acted personally, Ye Xuan would definitely die!
However, if True Martial God acted, Luo Hou would definitely act too!
At the moment, Luo Hou was useful to the Tomb of the Tao. Therefore, Luo Hou would not sit back and do nothing!
The first method would not work!
Then there was only one left!
Let the Daoting geniuses in the Purgatory Battlefield kill him!
Bai Dizi and True Martial God were not idiots. They definitely would not let one or two Daoting geniuses kill Ye Xuan!
In other words, there was a high possibility that the Daoting geniuses in the Purgatory Battlefield would join forces!
Thinking of this, Ye Xuan silently took out a black robe. After the black robe on the ship, only his face was exposed. As if he felt that it was not enough, he took out a black half-mask and wore it.
Now, unless the other party was an expert like True Martial God, ordinary people would not be able to use their divine sense to check him!
Although he was not afraid of the geniuses here, he would not underestimate them!
There were countless geniuses in the world. Ye Xuan did not think that he was number one!
There was nothing wrong with being cautious!
After a while, Ye Xuan picked up the grilled fish and started eating.
At this moment, a powerful aura suddenly appeared not far from Ye Xuan. Ye Xuan looked up and saw a man walking slowly in front of him. The man held a dagger in his hand and walked sloppily.
The Dao Proving Realm!
Furthermore, he was at the peak of the Dao Validation realm!
The man sized up Ye Xuan. "You look a little unfamiliar!"
Ye Xuan tossed the fish bone to the side and said, "Is something the matter?"
The man's lips curled up. "Robbery!"
Ye Xuan looked at the man. "Are you from Daoting or the Dao Tomb?"
The man frowned. "Can't you tell?"
Ye Xuan was puzzled. "What do you think?"
The man pointed at the left side of his chest. There was a small black word there: Dao!
Daoting!
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "I'm also Daoting!"
The man frowned. "You're also a Daoting?"
Ye Xuan nodded.
The man glanced at Ye Xuan's chest and shook his head. "There's no mark!"
Ye Xuan suddenly opened his palm, and a surge of energy appeared in his hand.
Godly Energy!
However, he didn't reveal too much. Thus, the man didn't know what Godly Energy he had!
Seeing the Godly Energy in Ye Xuan's hand, a trace of surprise flashed in the man's eyes. "Godly Energy!
You've obtained a Great Dao inheritance? "
Ye Xuan nodded. "I am a Dao Protector!"
The man sized up Ye Xuan. "How should I address you, brother?"
Ye Xuan thought for a moment and said, "Yang Xuan!"
Yang Xuan!
Within Ye Xuan's body, the Sword Spirit suddenly trembled.
"Yang Xuan?"
The man sized up Ye Xuan again. "Why didn't you go to the Dao Mountain?"
Ye Xuan said in a deep voice, "I'm looking for someone!"
The man asked, "Ye Xuan?"
Ye Xuan hurriedly nodded.
The man said in a deep voice, "Brother Xuan, Guan Shan said that no one is allowed to look for Ye Xuan alone!"
Ye Xuan frowned. "Is Ye Xuan very strong?"
The man nodded. "It's said that he can exchange a hundred moves with True Martial God Lord without dying!
True Martial God Lord and White Emperor Star Lord have instructed us not to underestimate Ye Xuan! "
Ye Xuan said softly, "So that's how it is!"
The man nodded. "Let's go!
Let's go to the Dao Mountain! "
Ye Xuan asked, "How should I address you, sir?"
The man smiled. "Song Fei!"
Ye Xuan nodded. "Brother Song, let's go to the Dao Mountain!"
Song Fei said, "Let's go!"
The two set off for the Dao Mountain!
Along the way, Ye Xuan would ask questions from time to time. Soon, he had a thorough understanding of the entire Purgatory Battlefield.
The entire Purgatory Battlefield was divided into two camps. One was the Daoting, and the other was the Dao Tomb.
The Daoting was led by Guan Shan, and Guan Shan was the number one genius of the Daoting. His strength had reached the peak of the Dao Vindication Realm, and he was extremely powerful!
The Dao Tomb was led by the number one genius of the Dao Tomb, Fan Shuishui.
It was worth mentioning that there was a mine in this Purgatory Battlefield, and that was the Fortune Divine Crystal. The main goal of both sides was to fight for this mine!
But now, the Daoting's main goal was to kill Ye Xuan.
Guan Shan had summoned all the monsters of the Daoting!
And in this Purgatory Battlefield, there were more than a hundred monsters of the Daoting, and the weakest was at the Self Release Realm!
These people were all the most monstrous of the younger generation of the Daoting.
The Daoting placed them here mainly to train them!
At this time, Song Fei suddenly smiled. "Brother Xuan, True Martial God Lord said that if we can kill Ye Xuan, each of us will be rewarded with twenty Fortune Divine Crystals!
Twenty Fortune Divine Crystals!
If we are lucky, we will only get ten Fortune Divine Crystals in a year. I didn't expect Ye Xuan's head to be so valuable! "
Ye Xuan said seriously, "Brother Song Fei, you are wrong."
Song Fei looked at Ye Xuan, and Ye Xuan said seriously, "Brother Song Fei, why did the God Lord and the others give such a tempting reward?
There is only one explanation, and that is that Ye Xuan is not easy to deal with!
Also, the God Lord and the others asked us to join forces. What does this mean?
It means that they value Ye Xuan very much, and Ye Xuan is actually valued by the God Lord. Think about it, how monstrous is this Ye Xuan? "
Song Fei nodded. "Brother Xuan is right. It is said that Ye Xuan proves his Dao through killing, and his bloodline is extremely powerful. We cannot underestimate him!"
Ye Xuan nodded. "Yes, we must treat Ye Xuan with caution!"
Song Fei smiled and said, "However, I would like to see this Ye Xuan for myself. I want to see what he is capable of!"
Arrogance!
Although the God Lord True Martial had asked them to value Ye Xuan, those who could survive in this place were all monstrous geniuses.
Many people were not convinced that the God Lord True Martial valued a young man so highly.
Ye Xuan looked at Song Fei but did not speak.
Soon, the two arrived at the Path Mountain.
The Path Mountain was a small mountain, and there were already sixty to seventy people gathered at the top of the mountain. They were all Daoting geniuses!
Ye Xuan glanced at those geniuses from the Dao Palace. He had to admit that these geniuses from the Dao Palace were indeed very strong. Most of them were in the Dao Proving Realm, and judging from their auras, they were the kind that had nothing to hide!
If these people joined forces, he would not be able to defeat them.
After all, all of them were veterans of countless battles!
Especially a few of them, their auras were extremely thick!
They'd attained the Dao Control Realm!
Meanwhile, a man suddenly appeared here. He wore a dark robe, had long hair that hung loosely on his shoulders, and held a folding fan in his hand. He seemed very graceful.
There was a woman by his side, and it was Xi Ruo who'd come from the Daoting.
Guan Shan glanced at them and said, "All of you should be aware of the reason I gathered all of you here!"
Meanwhile, a man suddenly said, "Is that fellow, Ye Xuan, really that strong?
Does he want all of us to join forces? "
Guan Shan glanced at the man, "Li Sheng, can you withstand 100 blows from the God Lord True Martial?"
The man called Li Sheng spoke solemnly, "Can he really withstand 100 blows from the God Lord True Martial?"
Guan Shan gazed at Xi Ruo. Xi Ruo stepped forward and glanced at the others, "All of you are monstrous geniuses amongst monstrous geniuses. However, allow me to tell all of you that Ye Xuan isn't simple at all. He proved his Dao by killing while he was in the Daoting, and he killed the First Swordsman of the Daoting, Feng Daoxiu, and 2 other Divine Generals by himself.
Besides that, he even challenged the God Lord True Martial. I can tell all of you that the God Lord True Martial didn't hold back at all. However, he's still alive. "
When she spoke up to this point, she paused for a moment and continued, "His strength isn't the most important thing. The most important thing is that he's extremely cunning and likes to play dirty. So, all of you can't be careless if you encounter him."
Below, another man smiled and said, "Miss Xi Ruo's words make me want to meet this Ye Xuan even more!"
Many people in the surroundings smiled as they chimed in.
Xi Ruo sighed softly in her heart.
As expected, all of these geniuses had their own pride. Ye Xuan was merely at the Dao Validation Realm, so how could they possibly take Ye Xuan seriously?
Actually, if she hadn't witnessed Ye Xuan's strength with her own eyes, she wouldn't have paid much attention to Ye Xuan either.
All of them had a head on their shoulders, so who would be afraid of whom?
However, she'd witnessed Ye Xuan's strength. That fellow proved his Dao by killing. Not to mention the younger generation, even amongst the older generation of the Daoting, there weren't many who could defeat Ye Xuan!
Otherwise, White Emperor Starlord wouldn't have such a headache!
Meanwhile, Guan Shan suddenly said, "Xi Ruo, what else did White Emperor Starlord and the God Lord True Martial say?"
Xi Ruo restrained her thoughts and gazed at Guan Shan, "The reason they chose to make peace with the Dao Tomb was because they wanted to withdraw and kill Ye Xuan.
This person is a thorn in the side of the Daoting. Do you understand, Guan Shan? "
Guan Shan nodded, "I understand!"
Xi Ruo nodded slightly, "Guan Shan, I know your strength. Few of the younger generation are a match for you. However, if you meet Ye Xuan, do not fight him one-on-one. You must gather everyone's strength to kill him and prevent any future troubles!"
Guan Shan smiled, "Actually, I'd like to fight him one-on-one.
Fan Shuishui and I have been fighting for so many years, and we have always been evenly matched. As for this Ye Xuan, I really want to meet him!
However, since White Emperor Starlord and the God Lord True Martial value this person so much, I naturally won't underestimate him. If I find him, I will gather everyone's strength to kill him. "
Xi Ruo nodded, "That would be best!"
At this time, all the Daoting powerhouses had basically arrived.
Soon, they began to discuss how to kill Ye Xuan.
Ye Xuan would also give some suggestions from time to time.
The discussion was very excited.
PS: I won't ask for votes!
Anyway, it's useless. I don't want to be humble anymore!
I won't bow down for mere monthly votes!
I treat money like dirt!
I have no desires!









Chapter 1365
How could they kill Ye Xuan?
This was the core of the Daoting experts' discussion.
Ye Xuan watched quietly from the side. Dammit, these people want to gang up on me!
Xi Ruo suddenly said, "Everyone, if we want to kill Ye Xuan, we must find this person first!"
Guan Shan nodded, "We must find this person first."
Ye Xuan suddenly stepped forward, "Miss Xi Ruo, I think we need to be wary of two things!"
Xi Ruo looked at Ye Xuan, "What are they?"
Ye Xuan said solemnly, "First, we must be careful of Ye Xuan sneaking into our midst."
Xi Ruo frowned slightly, "Sneaking into our midst?"
Ye Xuan nodded, "Didn't you say that Ye Xuan is cunning?
Therefore, I think we must confirm the number of people here. We cannot let that Ye Xuan sneak into our midst! "
Xi Ruo pondered for a moment, "That makes sense!"
Ye Xuan looked around, "We have one hundred and eight people here. Guan Shan, do you recognize all of them?"
Guan Shan shook his head.
Although he was the leader of the Daoting experts in the Purgatory Battlefield, he did not know all the Daoting geniuses because they usually had their own things to do. They would only gather at that time when the Fortune Divine Crystal appeared in the ore vein. Normally, they would not gather together and would cultivate on their own.
Ye Xuan said, "Therefore, we must confirm the number of people here to prevent that Ye Xuan sneaking into our midst. Perhaps not, but it is better to be safe than sorry!"
Guan Shan nodded slightly, "You're right!"
Ye Xuan looked at everyone present, "Everyone should get to know each other now. We will know if there are any unfamiliar faces in the future."
Everyone exchanged glances. With the strength they possessed, they were able to remember everyone here with a single glance.
At this moment, Xi Ruo suddenly looked at Ye Xuan, "You are?"
Ye Xuan cupped his fists, "I am Yang Xuan, Song Fei's brother!"
Song Fei!
Not far away, Song Fei was stunned. Brother?
At this time, Ye Xuan looked at Song Fei and said with a smile, "From now on, all of us Daoting are brothers. We will live and die together!"
Everyone looked at Ye Xuan.
Ye Xuan said in a deep voice, "Everyone, you must understand that our enemy is not only Ye Xuan, but also the Dao Tomb!
If Ye Xuan enters this battlefield, do you think that the Dao Tomb will just sit back and watch? "
The Dao Tomb!
The expressions of everyone here gradually became solemn when they heard this.
Ye Xuan continued, "That's the second thing I wanted to tell you. It's very likely that Ye Xuan will join the Dao Tomb!
Once Ye Xuan joins the Dao Tomb, then it will be extremely disadvantageous to us. "
Xi Ruo gazed at Ye Xuan, "Brother Xuan, what do you think we should do now?"
Ye Xuan thought for a moment and said, "It's very simple. We'll find Ye Xuan before he joins the Dao Tomb, and then we'll kill him!"
Guan Shan suddenly said, "So, we have to find Ye Xuan first!"
Ye Xuan nodded, "The important matter at hand is to find Ye Xuan. However, I think that it's difficult to find him using ordinary methods. Just think about it, how could Ye Xuan not be aware of our intentions when we're all gathered here?
No matter how strong he is, it's impossible for him to fight all of us on his own. So, I think that Ye Xuan will definitely choose to hide himself and attack us from the shadows! "
As he spoke, he gazed at Xi Ruo, "Miss Xi Ruo, just think about it. If Ye Xuan hides in the shadows and attacks us from the shadows …."
Xi Ruo's expression became quite unsightly when she heard this.
After all, how terrifying was Ye Xuan's strength?
If such a person were to hide in the shadows, then everyone here would feel like a blade was pressing against their backs, and they wouldn't be able to rest at all!
Meanwhile, Ye Xuan suddenly said, "So, we must lure Ye Xuan out!"
Xi Ruo gazed at Ye Xuan, "How?"
Ye Xuan thought for a moment and said, "The Divine Fortune Crystal!
Ye Xuan has attained the Dao Validation Realm, so he'll absolutely be unable to refuse the Divine Fortune Crystal. So, we can use the Divine Fortune Crystal to lure him out and kill him! "
Xi Ruo pondered deeply for a moment before she said, "I think that's a feasible method. However, I think that Ye Xuan won't fall for it!"
Ye Xuan spoke seriously, "He will absolutely not fall for it if it's just a few Divine Fortune Crystals. But what if it's a lot?"
Xi Ruo frowned slightly, "A lot?"
Ye Xuan nodded, "What if it's a few hundred Divine Fortune Crystals?"
A few hundred!
Everyone's eyelids twitched when they heard this.
A few hundred!
They were only able to obtain a little over 10 Divine Fortune Crystals every year!
A few hundred?
That was insane!
Ye Xuan continued, "Everyone, I think that this is a test given to us by Divine Lord True Martial and White Emperor Starlord!"
All of them gazed at Ye Xuan, and Ye Xuan spoke solemnly, "White Emperor Starlord and True Martial Divine Lord view Ye Xuan as a formidable enemy of our Daoting in the future. Do they really think highly of Ye Xuan?
Under such circumstances, how could we be calculative about our own gains and losses?
Everyone, if we don't unite and work together, then just think about it, how would White Emperor Starlord and True Martial Divine Lord view us? "
All of them fell silent.
Ye Xuan continued, "This time, we're not fighting for our own interests. We're fighting for Daoting!
Everyone, White Emperor Starlord and True Martial Divine Lord view Ye Xuan very highly. This time, it's a test for our Daoting younger generation. If so many of us can't kill Ye Xuan, then what hope does our Daoting have in the future?
Therefore, this time, we must kill Ye Xuan at all costs. We must let White Emperor Starlord and True Martial Divine Lord understand that our Daoting younger generation is not inferior to Ye Xuan! "
Xi Ruo nodded slightly. "Brother Xuan is right. Everyone, White Emperor Starlord has sent countless experts to kill Ye Xuan, but they all failed. This time, Ye Xuan has entered the Purgatory Battlefield. White Emperor Starlord and True Martial Divine Lord want us to deal with Ye Xuan. This is actually a test for us. If so many of us can't kill Ye Xuan, how disappointed will White Emperor Starlord and True Martial Divine Lord be?
Moreover, how will the younger generation of the Dao Court have any face left? "
Hearing this, everyone nodded in agreement.
Although they all had their own ideas, they still had a sense of right and wrong.
At this time, it would be very stupid for anyone to play tricks. White Emperor Starlord and True Martial Divine Lord were not stupid!
Usually, one could have internal strife because only with competition could there be progress!
But at this time, if anyone were to have internal strife, the higher-ups would absolutely not spare him!
At this time, Ye Xuan suddenly looked at Guan Shan. "Brother Guan Shan, you are the strongest among us. You must bear the heavy responsibility of killing Ye Xuan. You must not refuse!"
Hearing this, Guan Shan, who had been silent, suddenly looked at Ye Xuan. At this moment, he suddenly had a good impression of Ye Xuan. "To kill Ye Xuan, we need everyone to work together!"
Ye Xuan hurriedly cupped his fists and said, "We'll definitely do our best to support Brother Guan Shan!"
Guan Shan nodded slightly. "Brother Xuan, in your opinion, would Ye Xuan really fall for it if we use the Fortune Divine Crystals as bait?"
Ye Xuan spoke in a low voice, "We can give it a try!"
Guan Shan asked, "How?"
Ye Xuan thought for a moment and was about to speak when Xi Ruo spoke abruptly, "We can do this. We can spread the news that a few hundred Fortune Divine Crystals have suddenly appeared in that vein!"
Guan Shan frowned slightly. "In that way, the Dao Tomb will definitely hear of it and come over!"
Xi Ruo nodded. "Yes, but Ye Xuan will definitely come as well!"
Guan Shan gazed at Xi Ruo. "What do you think, Miss Xi Ruo?"
Xi Ruo said in a low voice, "As far as I know, Ye Xuan has just joined the Dao Tomb, and his relationship with the Dao Tomb is not particularly good. The reason why Luo Hou took him in is because he wants to use him to deal with me, Daoting!
As for Ye Xuan and Fan Shuishui, I believe that Fan Shuishui and the others will not fight us to the death for a mere Ye Xuan. Ye Xuan has just arrived, so it's impossible for him to have a deep relationship with them. Coupled with his special identity, I believe that they will not fight us to the death for Ye Xuan. "
Guan Shan thought for a moment, then looked at Ye Xuan. "Brother Xuan, what do you think?"
Xi Ruo also looked at Ye Xuan.
Ye Xuan nodded. "Miss Xi Ruo's words are very reasonable. This method is feasible, but the Fortune Divine Crystals …"
Xi Ruo said with a smile, "Fishing naturally requires bait!"
She glanced at the crowd as she spoke, "All of you should have a lot of savings. Each of you will contribute five Fortune Divine Crystals. Once we're done, the five Fortune Divine Crystals will be returned to you untouched!"
The crowd hesitated for a moment, then took out five Fortune Divine Crystals.
In a short while, they had collected over five hundred Fortune Divine Crystals.
He had to admit that this was a huge sum of money!
As soon as the five hundred Fortune Divine Crystals appeared, an extremely pure wave of energy suddenly spread throughout the surroundings.
Ye Xuan glanced at the pile of Fortune Divine Crystals, and no one knew what he was thinking.
At this moment, Guan Shan suddenly said, "Let's go to the vein!"
It didn't take long for them to disappear from the Dao Mountain.
Before long, they arrived at the belly of a mountain. On the way, Ye Xuan learned that the vein stretched for eight hundred miles. The first four hundred miles were controlled by the Dao Tomb, and the last four hundred miles were controlled by the Daoting!
Moreover, the vein produced a few thousand Fortune Divine Crystals every year. Actually, it wasn't a small amount, but it wasn't much for everyone!
After all, a vein only produced a few thousand Fortune Divine Crystals every year, and those few thousand Fortune Divine Crystals were shared between the Daoting and the Dao Tomb!
Guan Shan placed the five hundred Fortune Divine Crystals within a cave. In an instant, the entire cave was filled with dense spiritual energy, and cultivating here was more than a few times faster than cultivating in the outside world!
At this moment, Ye Xuan finally understood why the Dao Tomb and the Daoting were fighting for the Heaven Abyss!
Experts were the core, but the Fortune Divine Crystals were actually the true core!
Because Fortune Divine Crystals could nurture experts!
Meanwhile, a man suddenly said, "Fan Shuishui and the others are here!
They're right outside! "
Guan Shan spoke softly, "They really came quickly!"
As he spoke, he glanced at the others, "All of us have to leave, and only one of us can stay here. Because if all of us are here, then Ye Xuan will absolutely not show himself!
So …. "
In the end, he looked at Ye Xuan, "Brother Xuan, stay here and guard these Fortune Divine Crystals.
Notify us immediately once Ye Xuan appears. If he doesn't, then keep these Fortune Divine Crystals. "
Meanwhile, Xi Ruo was about to speak when Ye Xuan suddenly said, "Why don't we do this? Miss Xi Ruo stays here as well. Ye Xuan is so strong, and I'm not confident in my ability to deal with him alone!
If Miss Xi Ruo is here, then even if Ye Xuan appears, he will absolutely not be able to kill me and Miss Xi Ruo in an instant! "
Guan Shan thought for a moment and nodded, "Alright!
Both of you be careful!
If I don't see Ye Xuan outside, I'll immediately notify the two of you, and you must be ready to notify us at any time!
If I find Ye Xuan, I'll notify the two of you as well. At that time, both of you keep the Fortune Divine Crystals! "
Ye Xuan nodded, "Understood!"
It didn't take long for Guan Shan and the others to leave.
Only Ye Xuan, Xi Ruo, and a pile of Fortune Divine Crystals that emanated dense spirit energy remained within the cave.
Meanwhile, Xi Ruo suddenly gazed at Ye Xuan, and she stared at Ye Xuan, "Brother Xuan, why are you wearing a mask?"
Ye Xuan thought for a moment, and then he said, "I'm too handsome. I'm afraid that women will ruin their lives if they see me!"
Xi Ruo was speechless.
...
At the top.









Chapter 1366
Inside the cave, Xi Ruo had a strange expression on her face!
Too handsome?
Xi Ruo sized up Ye Xuan and smiled, "Brother Xuan, do you think Ye Xuan will appear?"
Ye Xuan shook his head, "I don't know!
But I don't think he will refuse these several hundred fortune divine crystals! "
Xi Ruo nodded, "Yes!"
She turned to look outside the cave, "Brother Xuan, I'll go out and take a look. You stay here and guard."
Ye Xuan suddenly said, "There are so many divine crystals, I'm a little worried that I'll be guarding them alone!"
Xi Ruo smiled, "Brother Xuan, don't worry. If Ye Xuan appears, inform us immediately. We'll be here in two breaths' time!"
She walked out of the cave as she said this.
But right at this moment, a sword suddenly pressed against her forehead!
Ye Xuan had made his move!
Xi Ruo slowly closed her eyes.
Ye Xuan smiled, "When did Miss Xi Ruo discover me?"
Xi Ruo opened her eyes and looked at Ye Xuan, who had appeared in front of her. "What you said before!"
Ye Xuan frowned, "Which words?"
Xi Ruo said, "Too handsome, I'm afraid a woman will fall for him!"
Ye Xuan was stunned, then asked, "Why?"
Xi Ruo looked at Ye Xuan, "According to my investigation, Ye Xuan is a very thick-skinned person. No one else but a thick-skinned person could say what you just said. Moreover, you were wearing a mask, so I was wondering if you could be Ye Xuan.
Of course, I wasn't completely sure, so I wanted to go out and find Guan Shan and the others.
But now it seems that my guess was right! "
Ye Xuan smiled, "Miss is smart. Let me guess, you didn't call for help because you thought I could kill you in a second, right?"
Xi Ruo said solemnly, "Ye Xuan, you don't kill women, right?"
Ye Xuan nodded. "Yes!"
Xi Ruo's expression relaxed slightly. At this moment, the Soul Suppressing Sword in Ye Xuan's hand suddenly sank into her forehead.
Boom!
In an instant, the Soul Suppressing Sword absorbed Xi Ruo's soul.
His Divine Soul was destroyed!
Xi Ruo's eyes widened in disbelief.
Ye Xuan smiled. "I just don't kill my own woman. I still kill other women."
As he spoke, he put away the Soul Suppressing Sword.
Ye Xuan turned around and looked at the pile of Fortune Divine Crystals. With a wave of his right hand, all the Fortune Divine Crystals flew into his storage ring.
Ye Xuan looked around and said softly, "How should I deal with the aftermath?"
...
Outside the mine.
At this time, the people from the Dao Tomb were confronting Guan Shan and the others from the Daoting!
More than five hundred Creation Divine Crystals had suddenly appeared. Naturally, the Dao Tomb would not give up on this fat piece of meat so easily.
This time, there were more than a hundred people from the Dao Tomb.
Leading them was Fan Shuishui.
In the air, Fan Shuishui looked at Guan Shan and said with a smile, "Guan Shan, I heard that more than five hundred Fortune Divine Crystals have suddenly appeared. How about it, can we go take a look?
Don't worry, we're just going to take a look. We won't rob you! "
Guan Shan looked at the people behind Fan Shuishui and frowned.
No Ye Xuan?
At this time, Fan Shuishui suddenly said, "What, are you looking for Ye Xuan?"
Guan Shan looked at Fan Shuishui, "You know where Ye Xuan is?"
Fan Shuishui laughed, "Yes!
Do you want to know where he is? "
Guan Shan looked at Fan Shuishui, "What's your condition!"
Fan Shuishui stared at Guan Shan, "Five hundred Fortune Divine Crystals. As long as you give me five hundred Fortune Divine Crystals, not only will I tell you where Ye Xuan is, I can also guarantee that we will not interfere in the matter between you and Ye Xuan!"
Guan Shan narrowed his eyes, "Really?"
Fan Shuishui smiled, "Really!
So long as you're willing to give me five hundred Fortune Divine Crystals, then I, Fan Shuishui, and the others from the Dao Tomb will absolutely not interfere in the matter between you and Ye Xuan! "
Guan Shan was about to speak when a voice suddenly resounded from within the mine, "Brother Fan, it's a success!"
As soon as this voice resounded, a ray of light suddenly shot into the sky from within the mine, and then it vanished in the blink of an eye.
The expressions of Guan Shan and the others changed drastically when they witnessed this scene, and then they charged towards the cave.
Fan Shuishui's face was extremely gloomy as he gazed at the ray of light in the sky, and then he spat fiercely towards the side, "Dammit! You even dared to scheme against me! You're probably tired of living …."
...
When Guan Shan and the others entered the cave, they were dumbfounded.
At this moment, Xi Ruo was lying silently within the cave. There was a hole in the center of her forehead, and her soul had vanished.
As for Ye Xuan, even though Ye Xuan wasn't dead, he was in a terrible state. At this moment, Ye Xuan was leaning against the side of the mountain. There were over a dozen injuries all over his body, and it was especially so for the ones on his chest. They were so deep that his bones could be seen. It was an extremely shocking sight.
Guan Shan seemed to have thought of something, and he suddenly gazed at the Fortune Divine Crystals. However, all of them had vanished!
The expressions of Guan Shan and the others instantly turned extremely gloomy when they witnessed this scene!
Ye Xuan had arrived!
Not only had he instantly killed Xi Ruo, he'd heavily injured Yang Xuan and taken the Fortune Divine Crystal with him!
Guan Shan suddenly gazed at Ye Xuan, "Brother Xuan, why didn't you notify us?"
Ye Xuan shook his head. He was just about to speak when a mouthful of Blood Essence suddenly sprayed from his mouth.
All of them were speechless.
Ye Xuan wiped off the blood on the corner of his mouth and said, "It was too late!
He immediately attacked Xi Ruo as soon as he appeared. That attack …. "
When he spoke up to this point, his voice suddenly started trembling, "That attack was like a thunderclap. His sword was visible before the person could even see it. Miss Xi Ruo didn't even have time to react before it pierced through the center of her forehead …. I've lived for most of my life, yet I've never seen such a terrifying attack …. It was truly too terrifying!
That fellow, Ye Xuan, isn't a man, he's a god!
He's a god of the sword! "
All the others here exchanged glances when they heard this.
Guan Shan had an extremely solemn expression on his face as well!
He was clearly aware of Xi Ruo's strength. Even though Xi Ruo wasn't very strong, she wasn't weak either!
He'd instantly killed Xi Ruo with a single attack, so he had to ask himself if he could accomplish that.
The answer was very difficult!
Perhaps he, Guan Shan, could kill Xi Ruo, but he was absolutely unable to kill Xi Ruo with a single attack!
Guan Shan seemed to have thought of something, and he gazed at Ye Xuan. He was just about to speak when Ye Xuan suddenly spat out a few more mouthfuls of Blood Essence.
Guan Shan hesitated for a moment when he saw this, and then he said, "Brother Xuan, recuperate first!"
Ye Xuan nodded slightly, and then he leaned against the rock and slowly closed his eyes.
Guan Shan suddenly spoke fiercely, "Fan Shuishui!"
As soon as he finished speaking, he turned around and left.
The others in the surroundings left as well.
Guan Shan gazed at Fan Shuishui from outside the cave, "Fan Shuishui, what a great plan!
Not only did you obtain crystals, you even killed him! You killed two birds with one stone! "
Fan Shuishui spoke in a low voice, "Guan Shan, there's no relationship between us and that fellow, Ye Xuan!"
Guan Shan spoke fiercely, "There's no relationship?
Are you joking? "
Fan Shuishui frowned, "Guan Shan, don't let Ye Xuan use you. He's clearly trying to instigate a battle between us!"
Guan Shan suddenly roared furiously. "Fan Shuishui, is Ye Xuan from your Dao Tomb?" Fan Shuishui was speechless.
Actually, Ye Xuan really was from the Dao Tomb right now. However, they hadn't taken Ye Xuan to be on their side. After all, Ye Xuan was from the Fifth Dimension, and he wasn't on the same side as them.
Meanwhile, Guan Shan suddenly said, "Fan Shuishui, it's been a very long time since we sparred!
Why don't we have a good spar today! "
As soon as he finished speaking, he charged at Fan Shuishui!
On the other hand, the Daoting experts behind him charged over as well.
Fan Shuishui's expression instantly became extremely unsightly when he witnessed this scene. "Ye Xuan!"
He knew that they'd fallen into Ye Xuan's trap!
Ye Xuan hadn't just seized the Fortune Divine Crystals, he'd even shifted the blame to the Dao Tomb!
He's fucking inhumane!
Fan Shuishui didn't give it any further thought and charged forward as well.
At this moment, he could only choose to fight!
While the two sides were fighting, Ye Xuan continued to heal his injuries in the cave.
His injuries weren't healing very quickly. Ever since he was discovered by Xi Ruo, he understood that he had to be more cautious when doing things.
As if thinking of something, the corners of Ye Xuan's mouth curled up slightly.
Five hundred Fortune Divine Crystals!
With these five hundred Fortune Divine Crystals, the Fifth Dimension would be able to nurture even more super experts!
Especially Aro, An Lanxiu, and the others. They would definitely be able to easily reach the Dao Validation Realm. Not only that, but there would also be more and more Dao Validation Realm experts in the Fifth Dimension!
As if thinking of something, Ye Xuan suddenly shook his head and smiled bitterly. "Silly Sister Nian!"
Protecting the Fifth Dimension alone?
Although Mu Niannian had protected the Fifth Dimension, protecting the entire universe alone was really too stupid!
The Fifth Dimension belonged to everyone. If the living beings in the Fifth Dimension didn't cherish the Fifth Dimension, then it would be useless for anyone to protect it!
He, Ye Xuan, wouldn't protect the Fifth Dimension alone!
This was because he knew that there was a limit to one person's strength!
Only when all the experts of the Fifth Dimension united and protected together would the Fifth Dimension be able to live longer.
And what he, Ye Xuan, wanted to do was to nurture even more experts. Of course, he also understood that the experts of the Fifth Dimension were united because of benefits. Not many people truly cared about the Fifth Dimension!
But it didn't matter. He, Ye Xuan, could slowly nurture the next generation of people in the Fifth Dimension. If he couldn't change the thinking of this generation, then he would change the thinking of the next generation!
It could be said that he, Ye Xuan, was serious about the future of the Fifth Dimension.
He would protect the Fifth Dimension until the day he, Ye Xuan, died!
This was his promise to Sister Nian!
At this time, Ye Zhiming suddenly said, "What are your plans now?"
Ye Xuan guarded his thoughts. He looked outside and softly said, "Guan Shan isn't a stupid person. After he calms down, he will definitely think about one question, and that is why I didn't die!"
Ye Zhiming solemnly said, "Then how are you going to deal with it?"
Ye Xuan softly said, "I won't let him think about this question!
As long as my injuries don't recover in a short period of time, he will subconsciously ignore this question!
However, there is a thorny problem now. Xi Ruo's death will make them more wary of me. At this time, they will be even more united!
Not only them, but the Dao Tomb will also. Moreover, the Dao Tomb will probably hate me to the core. "
Ye Zhiming asked, "Then how are you going to counterattack?"
Ye Xuan slowly closed his eyes. "Let me think about it!"
Ye Zhiming: "…"
.....
PS: What's a mere monthly ticket worth mentioning?
No means no!









Chapter 1367
Outside the mine, Guan Shan, Fan Shuishui, and the others were still fighting.
It had to be said that this kind of battle was rare.
Usually, the two sides had conflicts almost every day, but they were all small-scale conflicts. It was rare for both sides to go all out.
This battle lasted for more than two hours.
Both sides stopped at the same time because both sides had lost more than twenty people. If this continued, both sides would perish together!
In the sky, Fan Shuishui stared at Guan Shan, "You fool, you were used by Ye Xuan!"
"Used?"
A sarcastic smile appeared at the corners of Guan Shan's mouth. "Fan Shuishui, you stall me outside and let Ye Xuan get the Fortune Divine Crystal. I have to say that you guys are cooperating really well!
Very good! "
Fan Shuishui fell silent.
Right now, he really had no way of explaining himself!
Was Ye Xuan from the Dao Tomb?
From the Daoting's point of view, Ye Xuan was from the Dao Tomb because Luo Hou had sent Ye Xuan!
But from their point of view, Ye Xuan wasn't from the Dao Tomb.
They had never acknowledged Ye Xuan!
He had wanted to use Ye Xuan to extort Guan Shan, but he didn't expect Ye Xuan to really appear!
Moreover, he had killed an expert from the Dao Court in an instant and framed him for it!
Not only did he not gain anything, but he had also caused trouble!
The more Fan Shuishui thought about it, the angrier he got!
As if thinking of something, Fan Shuishui looked at Guan Shan and sneered, "Guan Shan, from what I know, Ye Xuan hates you to the bone, so you have to be careful.
Haha … "
With that, he turned around and left with the others.
Guan Shan and the others had extremely unsightly expressions on their faces.
...
Dao Tomb City, there were only two people in the main hall, Bitter King and Luo Hou.
Bitter King said softly, "Fan Shuishui said that Ye Xuan was plotting against them!"
Luo Hou was expressionless, "Won't he plot against them?"
Bitter King looked at Rahu, "What are your plans?"
Luo Hou said softly, "Ye Xuan is a whetstone, a whetstone for the geniuses of Daoting, and also for the geniuses of the Dao Tomb.
Tell Fan Shuishui that we don't care about Ye Xuan. He can do whatever he wants! "
Bitter King was a bit worried. "This …"
Rahu looked at Bitter King. "Do you know what I thought when I first saw Ye Xuan?"
Bitter King said, "Just speak!"
Luo Hou stood up and walked to the entrance of the hall. He looked at the horizon and said softly, "Let's talk about this person's strength first. At such a young age, his Sword Dao has already reached the level of 'transformation', and he even has four types of domains. How terrifying is this?
The most important thing is that this person dares to fight and put his life on the line. His ferocity reminds me of someone! "
Bitter King frowned slightly, "Skyless?"
Luo Hou nodded, a complicated look flashed past his eyes, "The ruthlessness on his body is too similar to Skyless!"
Bitter King fell silent.
Skyless!
He was one of the Four Great Kings of the Dao Tomb. Not to mention Rahu, even the Lord had a headache dealing with this Skyless!
Because he was truly lawless!
At this moment, Rahu said again, "In this chaotic world, you can't survive without a bit of ruthlessness!
This person is not only ruthless, but also decisive!
The most terrifying thing about him is his intelligence. He knows how to take advantage of the situation, and is tactful in handling matters. He is not pedantic at all. In this aspect, Skyless is not as good as him. "
Bitter King said in a low voice, "Can Fan Shuishui and the others deal with him?
Can they deal with him? "
Rahu said softly, "Fan Shuishui has two choices. The first is to befriend Ye Xuan and become friends with Ye Xuan. This way, the Purgatory Battlefield will completely become the Dao Tomb's territory. The second choice is to ignore everything and let Ye Xuan and Guan Shan fight, then reap the benefits. This way, the Purgatory Battlefield will still be the Dao Tomb's territory."
Bitter King said softly, "There is a third choice!
To become enemies with Ye Xuan! "
Rahu nodded, "Although Ye Xuan is married to the Goddess, the Dao Tomb does not treat him as one of our own. Especially Fan Shuishui and the others, they will not accept Ye Xuan so easily. In their eyes, Ye Xuan is an outsider, and an outsider who can threaten their position!"
Bitter King sighed softly.
Ye Xuan's existence would definitely make Fan Shuishui feel threatened, because he was afraid that Ye Xuan would replace his position!
After all, the current younger generation of the Dao Tomb was Fan Shuishui.
But after Ye Xuan came, this position was a bit uncertain!
Bitter King said, "If he really thinks so …"
Rahu slowly closed his eyes, "Let's see what he chooses!"
Bitter King said in a low voice, "Have you thought about the future Ye Xuan?"
In fact, he was a little worried!
The current Ye Xuan could not threaten them, but that might not be the case in the future!
Not only was Ye Xuan strong, but his intelligence was also monstrously high.
Rahu smiled, "I know you are worried, but have you thought about who is the most worried the stronger Ye Xuan becomes?"
Bitter King said, "Daoting!"
Rahu nodded, "Daoting is more worried than us!
There is nothing wrong with letting Ye Xuan become a sharp sword against Daoting … "
...
Purgatory Battlefield.
Guan Shan and the others returned to the cave. At this time, Ye Xuan's injuries had only recovered by twenty to thirty percent.
Guan Shan and the others had ugly expressions. This time, not only had they lost more than twenty people, they had also lost more than five hundred Fortune Divine Crystals!
What a bloody loss!
As if thinking of something, Guan Shan looked at Ye Xuan, "Brother Xuan, you've fought with Ye Xuan before. Is his sword really that terrifying?"
Ye Xuan thought for a moment, then said in a low voice, "Now that I think about it, I realized something. Ye Xuan launched a sneak attack. If not for that, Miss Xi Ruo would not have been killed by his sword, and I would not have been so seriously injured!"
Guan Shan narrowed his eyes, "Sneak attack?"
Ye Xuan nodded, "He was hiding in the cave, and Miss Xi Ruo and I were not prepared, so …"
Guan Shan slowly closed his eyes.
If it was a sneak attack, he could have killed Xi Ruo in an instant!
After all, it was a sneak attack!
Thinking of this, Guan Shan felt much more relaxed.
After all, if Ye Xuan had really killed Xi Ruo with a single strike of his sword in a head-on battle, then his strength would truly be too terrifying!
Meanwhile, Ye Xuan suddenly spoke in a low voice, "Looks like the Dao Tomb has joined forces with Ye Xuan. We're in a very bad situation now!"
Guan Shan and the others had solemn expressions on their faces when they heard this.
Wouldn't Ye Xuan be like a tiger that had grown wings if he joined the Dao Tomb?
All of them fell silent within the cave.
Meanwhile, Ye Xuan suddenly sat up, and he spoke fiercely, "Everyone, the Dao Tomb and Ye Xuan will absolutely not let us go. Since it's like that, why don't we fight them to the death?"
Everyone looked at Ye Xuan when they heard this.
Guan Shan spoke in a low voice, "Fight them to the death?"
Guan Shan spoke in a low voice, "Fight them to the death?"
Ye Xuan nodded, "Brother Guan Shan, just think about it. Now that Ye Xuan has joined the Dao Tomb, do you think they will let us go?
They won't!
The Dao Tomb will definitely join forces with Ye Xuan to annihilate us, and then they'll take the entire vein for themselves!
If I'm not wrong, then Fan Shuishui and the others are definitely discussing how to eat us! "
Guan Shan's expression was quite unsightly.
Meanwhile, one of the men spoke abruptly, "Brother Xuan, then how do you think we should fight them to the death?"
Ye Xuan thought for a moment and said, "In any case, they won't let us go. Since it's like that, then why don't we strike first and gain the upper hand?"
Guan Shan fell silent.
Fight them to the death?
Even though the Dao Tomb and the Dao Tomb were constantly fighting each other, they rarely fought to the death.
Their main objective here was to temper themselves and obtain Fortune Crystals. Fight them to the death?
Even though they fought with their lives on the line, they rarely fought to the death.
It could be said that the Purgatory of Hell wasn't quite the same as it had been in the past, and it was much more harmonious!
In the past, the Purgatory of Hell had truly fought with their lives on the line. But now, both sides had a tacit understanding. As for the vein?
You take half, we take half, and everyone develops peacefully.
So, when Ye Xuan mentioned fighting them to the death, Guan Shan hesitated!
Ye Xuan added when he saw Guan Shan hesitate, "Even if we don't make a move, they will!"
Guan Shan slowly clenched his fists.
Meanwhile, Ye Xuan continued, "We can do this. Ask Fan Shuishui to hand over Ye Xuan because Ye Xuan killed our Miss Xi Ruo. If Fan Shuishui is willing to ignore this matter, then we can only target Ye Xuan!"
Guan Shan looked at Ye Xuan and asked, "What if he insists on interfering?"
Ye Xuan suddenly spoke angrily, "Ye Xuan killed our people and seized our Fortune Divine Crystals!
Are we going to cower just because Fan Shuishui wants to interfere?
Brother Guan Shan, think about it carefully. Even if we cower, will Ye Xuan and Fan Shuishui let us go?
No!
They won't!
They will only seek revenge in a frenzy!
If we don't make a move now, then we'll lose the initiative, and we'll be in a very passive position once they make a move! "
Guan Shan fell silent.
Ye Xuan continued, "Brother Guan Shan, all of you are aware that Ye Xuan is a very devious person. If he keeps hiding in the shadows and plays tricks, then we won't be able to guard against him!
Since it's like that, then why don't we just fight them to the death!
I don't believe that the Dao Tomb will protect Ye Xuan to the death. It doesn't matter even if they do. We have a chance of winning if we fight them head-on.
But if we continue to be in a passive position, then we'll be in trouble! "
A man suddenly said, "Brother Xuan is right. If we don't take the initiative to attack, then we'll always be in a passive position. That's even more disadvantageous to us!
Since it's like that, then why don't we fight them to the death!
If Fan Shuishui doesn't care about Ye Xuan, then we'll target Ye Xuan. If he insists on interfering, then we'll fight them to the death! "
Another man said, "Right, we can't continue to be in a passive position. We'll fight them to the death!"
It didn't take long for everyone to look at Guan Shan.
Guan Shan fell silent for a moment before he said, "Alright, then we'll fight them to the death!
Let's go! "
As soon as he finished speaking, he led the others away.
Meanwhile, Ye Xuan stood up as well. Guan Shan gazed at Ye Xuan, "Brother Xuan, are you going as well?"
Ye Xuan spoke fiercely, "How can I be left out at a time like this?
I want to live and die with all of you. I, Ye …. "
His voice stopped abruptly when he spoke up to this point.
Dammit, I was too immersed in my acting and almost said my real name!
.....

Chapter 1368
Soon, the group went to look for Fan Shuishui.
Kill Ye Xuan!
Ye Xuan was also in the group. He had been secretly observing Guan Shan. Guan Shan's expression was calm after he came out of the cave. No one knew what he was thinking.
Ye Xuan had never thought that he was smart enough to play everyone in the palm of his hand.
The fact that Xi Ruo had seen through him had made him even more cautious!
Although Guan Shan was a man of few words, he was definitely not a fool.
If he was a fool, he would not have been able to survive in this place for so long. Fortunately, Xi Ruo, who was most familiar with Ye Xuan, was dead. If Guan Shan had investigated him like Xi Ruo had, he would have been exposed by now!
Soon, the group arrived at a valley. This valley was Fan Shuishui's group's base!
As soon as Guan Shan's group arrived, Fan Shuishui appeared in front of them with the geniuses of the Dao Tomb.
Fan Shuishui said coldly, "Guan Shan, are you really that stupid?"
Guan Shan looked at Fan Shuishui, "Where is Ye Xuan?"
Fan Shuishui said angrily, "I don't know!"
Guan Shan frowned slightly, "You don't know?"
Fan Shuishui said in a low voice, "Guan Shan, although Ye Xuan has come to the Purgatory Realm, he has not come to us!
I said that I know Ye Xuan's whereabouts just to extort money from you.
As for Ye Xuan's whereabouts, I really don't know! "
Guan Shan fell silent.
Fan Shuishui said again, "If you find him, I can promise you that the Dao Tomb will not interfere!"
Guan Shan slowly closed his eyes. No one knew what he was thinking.
Fan Shuishui said again, "Guan Shan, Ye Xuan is not a simple person. He killed someone, stole the divine crystal, and wants to frame the Dao Tomb. His goal is very simple. He wants us to fight to the death. Think about it, if we fight to the death and he comes out …"
At this moment, Ye Xuan, who was not far away, suddenly stepped forward. "Fan Shuishui, are you joking?"
Fan Shuishui looked at Ye Xuan. "What's wrong?"
Ye Xuan sneered, "Fan Shuishui, is Ye Xuan a member of your Dao Tomb?"
Fan Shuishui looked at Ye Xuan. "What are you trying to say?"
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "What is Ye Xuan's purpose?
It's the destruction of my Daoting!
What is your purpose in coming to the Dao Tomb?
Didn't they destroy my Daoting in the end?
Why was Ye Xuan able to come here?
It was because the Dao Tomb had sent him here!
If I didn't guess wrongly, the reason your Dao Tomb Ground sent him over is definitely to exterminate us and monopolize this Purgatory Battlefield's ore veins! "
Upon hearing this, Guan Shan suddenly opened his eyes and looked at Fan Shuishui.
At this time, Ye Xuan said, "Before Ye Xuan came, neither of us could do anything to the other. But now, Ye Xuan is here!
I dare say that you must have been discussing how to exterminate us and monopolize the entire Purgatory Battlefield! "
Hearing Ye Xuan's words, everyone looked at Fan Shuishui with unfriendly expressions.
Fan Shuishui's expression was somewhat gloomy. "I said!
I've never seen Ye Xuan! "
Ye Xuan sneered, "Fan Shuishui, don't put on an act here!
Today, either you hand over Ye Xuan, or we'll fight to the death! "
Fan Shuishui's eyes flashed with a trace of darkness. "Are you threatening me?"
Ye Xuan suddenly pointed at Fan Shuishui in anger. "I'll fuck your ancestors!"
Everyone: "…"
Fan Shuishui was instantly enraged. He directly punched out.
In the distance, Ye Xuan's expression changed greatly. He raised his arms to block.
Bang!
Before the crowd could react, Ye Xuan was sent flying hundreds of feet away. In the end, he crashed heavily on a giant rock.
Bang!
The enormous rock shattered into pieces. On the ground, Ye Xuan was just about to crawl up, but he spat out a few mouthfuls of Blood Essence. After that, he crawled directly into the pile of rubble, and his body trembled for a while before he completely stopped moving!
He's courting death!
Fan Shuishui frowned when he saw this. Dammit! I didn't even use much strength!
Is this fellow so weak?
Meanwhile, all the Daoting geniuses were infuriated!
Dammit!
This is going too far!
Before Guan Shan could give the order, all the Daoting geniuses had charged out.
Fan Shuishui frowned when he saw this. At this moment, he felt that the matter was slightly strange. However, he didn't have the time to think too much about it because the Daoting geniuses had charged over!
In next to no time, the battle had begun!
As for Ye Xuan, he was still lying in the pile of rubble, and no one cared about him.
Amidst the rubble, Ye Xuan's eyes slowly closed, and then he started to swiftly recuperate.
Meanwhile, Ye Zhiming spoke abruptly, "What do you plan to do next?"
Ye Xuan spoke softly, "I've noticed a problem recently, and it's that both the Dao Tomb and Daoting don't want to engage in a true bloody battle. Because their strengths are on par, and a bloody battle would only result in both sides suffering heavy losses!
So, both the Daoting and the Dao Tomb wouldn't engage in a true bloody battle. Especially the Daoting right now. They view me as a thorn in their side, so they'll definitely try their best to eliminate me!
The reason the Dao Tomb is protecting me now is because I'm useful to them. But if the Daoting gives up sufficient benefits, then the Dao Tomb wouldn't hesitate to abandon me! "
Ye Zhiming spoke in a low voice, "You must gather all the Dao Scriptures and summon the Grand Dao's Spirit!"
Ye Xuan shook his head, "I can't!
I only have 5 Dao Scriptures right now, and it's very difficult to gather all of them!
I can't place my hopes on the Grand Dao's Spirit! "
Ye Zhiming agreed, "Indeed!"
Ye Xuan slowly closed his eyes, "Let me think about it!"
He couldn't take a single wrong step now, or he would be consigned to eternal damnation!
As if he'd thought of something, Ye Xuan felt an indescribable pain in his heart.
Ye Zhiming fell silent as well.
The current Ye Xuan made her feel slightly terrified, and of course, she felt even more heartache for him!
Ye Xuan was taking one step and looking ten steps ahead, and he had no choice but to do so. Whether it was the Daoting or the Dao Tomb, they weren't things that Ye Xuan could go against right now.
If he wanted to survive in these cracks, then he had to advance step by step, and he couldn't take a single wrong step!
At this moment, the battle between Guan Shan, Fan Shuishui, and the others had reached its climax, and people were dying at every moment.
Fan Shuishui who was fighting Guan Shan in the sky suddenly spoke fiercely, "Guan Shan! You idiot! You've been used by Ye Xuan!"
Guan Shan's face was quite gloomy. At this moment, he felt that there was something fishy about the situation as well. Why hasn't Ye Xuan made an appearance yet?
As if he'd thought of something, Guan Shan suddenly turned around and gazed at the spot where Ye Xuan had fallen just now. At this moment, Ye Xuan was still amidst the pile of rubble.
Guan Shan suddenly disappeared from where he was. When he reappeared, he was already in front of the pile of rubble. With a wave of his right hand, the pile of rubble was immediately reduced to dust. He looked at Ye Xuan, who was lying on the ground on his last breath, and was about to speak when Ye Xuan suddenly opened his eyes. The next moment, a ray of sword light appeared in front of Guan Shan.
Guan Shan's pupils constricted, and he instinctively raised his arm to block it.
Hiss!
The ray of light sliced off his right arm, and then it pierced through the center of his forehead!
Hiss!
A strand of blood sprayed!
At this moment, everyone here was stunned!
Including Fan Shuishui!
Everyone stopped what they were doing.
Guan Shan gazed at Ye Xuan with slight disbelief, "It really is you!"
Ye Xuan patted off the dust on his body, "When did you notice?"
Guan Shan gazed at Ye Xuan, "Fan Shuishui said that you, Ye Xuan, would benefit the most from the battle between us. Since the beginning, you've been constantly sowing discord between us and Fan Shuishui, and you wanted us to fight a bloody battle. So, I thought of you!
Moreover, Xi Ruo died in the cave, but you're still alive!
This question had been in my mind since the beginning. However, I didn't have the heart to ask you when I saw that you were heavily injured …. Of course, all of this was just my guess. I didn't dare confirm that it was you until you attacked! "
Ye Xuan said, "I'm sure now!"
Guan Shan stared fixedly at Ye Xuan, "I'm not convinced that I'm going to die at your hands!"
Ye Xuan shook his head, "I don't need you to be convinced!"
Guan Shan spoke fiercely, "Ye Xuan, why don't you dare to fight me fair and square?
Why do you have to resort to such schemes? "
Ye Xuan patted Guan Shan's shoulder lightly, "Brother, all of you never intended to fight me one on one from the beginning. All of you were thinking about how to gang up on me and beat me to death!"
As soon as he finished speaking, the Soul Suppressing Sword trembled slightly, and Guan Shan's soul was completely absorbed.
Meanwhile, all the Daoting experts were looking at Ye Xuan.
There were less than 50 Daoting experts left, and most of them were injured.
Ye Xuan looked at Fan Shuishui. Fan Shuishui spoke fiercely, "Ye Xuan, how dare you! You even dared to scheme against me! You …."
Ye Xuan suddenly pointed his sword at Fan Shuishui, "I'll kill you if you say another word!"
Fan Shuishui's eyes narrowed slightly, "You …."
Ye Xuan vanished on the spot.
In the distance, Fan Shuishui's expression changed. He took a step back, and then he suddenly smashed his fist forward. This punch was like a torrent that surged through a dam, and a destructive force swept out and destroyed everything in its path!
Meanwhile, Ye Xuan's sword arrived before Chen Xi.
Hiss!
Everyone watched as that powerful force was instantly shattered. At the same time, Fan Shuishui retreated explosively by 300m!
Fan Shuishui's four Domains enveloped him as soon as he stopped moving. In the next moment, another ray of light appeared in front of him.
Ye Xuan had attacked with all his might, and he'd practically held nothing back!
Fan Shuishui's pupils constricted, and he hurriedly said, "Quickly attack!"
The experts behind him were about to attack.
Meanwhile, Ye Xuan suddenly shouted furiously, "I'm acting on Rahu's orders to kill Fan Shuishui. Who dares to attack?"
Acting on Rahu's orders?
The geniuses of the Dao Tomb were stunned.
What the hell?
While they were still stunned, Ye Xuan had arrived in front of Fan Shuishui, and a ray of light slashed down towards Fan Shuishui's head.
Hiss!
In front of everyone's eyes, Fan Shuishui was directly cut into two halves by the sword!
The geniuses of the Dao Tomb were stunned when they witnessed this scene.
On the other hand, Fan Shuishui's eyes were opened wide even at the moment of his death. He hadn't expected that Ye Xuan would kill him just like that!
Ye Xuan gazed at the geniuses of the Dao Tomb, "From now onward, I'm your boss. Guan Shan is dead. So long as we kill these fellows from the Daoting Sects, then the Purgatory Battlefield will belong to our Dao Tomb!
Will all of you accept such a great undertaking? "
The experts of the Dao Tomb were slightly tempted when they heard this.
Both sides had been fighting in the Purgatory Battlefield for over a thousand years, but a victor had never been determined. So, if they were able to determine a victor this time, then they would definitely be able to make a name for themselves in the Dao Tomb!
Meanwhile, Ye Xuan said, "Rahu has ordered that everyone who captures the Purgatory Battlefield will be rewarded with 20 Divine Fortune Crystals!"
Meanwhile, one of the geniuses of the Dao Tomb spoke in a low voice, "Ye …. Ye Xuan …. Are you telling the truth?"
Ye Xuan suddenly spoke angrily, "I, Ye Xuan, am the number one Swordsman in the world, the number one expert in the younger generation. Would I lie?
Are you looking down on me? "
That genius hesitated for a moment and said, "I … that's not what I meant …. Don't be angry …."
....









Chapter 1369
Twenty Fortune Divine Crystals!
It had to be said that the experts of the Dao Tomb were very tempted!
They had come here not only to train themselves, but also for wealth. Twenty Fortune Divine Crystals was not a small sum to them.
Of course, the most tempting thing was the great cause that Ye Xuan had mentioned!
The Daoting and the Dao Tomb had been fighting for so many years, but there had never been a winner in the Purgatory Battlefield. Now, as long as they followed Ye Xuan, the Purgatory Battlefield would immediately become the Dao Tomb's, and all of them would become the heroes of the Dao Tomb!
When they thought up to here, everyone gazed at the experts of the Dao Court.
At this moment, the Daoting geniuses suddenly turned around and fled!
Originally, they had wanted to kill Ye Xuan. After all, they had the advantage in numbers. However, they did not expect that Ye Xuan had instigated these people from the Dao Tomb.
With the help of these people from the Dao Tomb, Ye Xuan had no chance of winning!
Run!
Seeing the Daoting geniuses fleeing, Ye Xuan suddenly shouted angrily, "Kill!"
As he spoke, he directly rushed out with his sword in hand.
Very soon, the geniuses from the Dao Tomb hesitated for a moment before they also rushed out …
Around an hour later, all the Daoting experts in the Purgatory Battlefield were killed!
None of the Daoting experts survived!
On the Dao Mountain, Ye Xuan stood with his sword in hand. Behind him were over a dozen corpses.
At this moment, the geniuses from the Dao Tomb were also by his side.
Everyone looked at Ye Xuan with a trace of fear in their eyes!
Although they had just joined forces with Ye Xuan, they did not forget that Ye Xuan had killed Fan Shuishui not long ago.
At this moment, Ye Xuan suddenly raised his head and said softly, "Why didn't the Daoting send anyone to interfere?"
At this moment, a man said in a deep voice, "The Daoting will not interfere!
As long as one entered this place, the experts of the older generation would not be able to interfere!
Even if they do, we will stop them!
It can be said that whoever enters this place is responsible for their own life and death! "
Ye Xuan nodded. "Understood!"
The man looked at Ye Xuan. "What do we do now?"
Ye Xuan was just about to speak when two figures suddenly appeared in the sky!
True Martial God and Bai Dizi!
At this moment, both of their faces were extremely gloomy!
Daoting, all the geniuses had died here!
Although these people were not top-notch powerhouses, they were Daoting's future!
It could be said that in the near future, there would be a gap in the backbone of the Daoting powerhouses!
Not only that, but from now on, the Purgatory Battlefield would become the private property of the Dao Tomb!
He had lost both his life and his wealth!
In fact, Bai Dizi regretted asking the Daoting younger generation to deal with Ye Xuan!
Although Ye Xuan was also from the younger generation, he was far more scheming than ordinary people could ever be compared to.
Daoting younger generation, although not stupid, when it came to scheming, they were far inferior to Ye Xuan, who had climbed up from the bottom.
Of course, the most important thing was Ye Xuan's strength!
Whether the Daoting admitted it or not, Ye Xuan was now the number one of the younger generation!
In a one-on-one fight, even some of the Daoting Sir Gods would not dare to say that they could defeat Ye Xuan, let alone the younger generation!
Bai Dizi suddenly said softly, "True Martial, let's go!"
True Martial did not move. He was still looking at Ye Xuan, his eyes filled with undisguised murderous intent.
Originally, he cherished talents, but now, he wanted to kill Ye Xuan even more!
This person would become a great enemy of the Daoting in the future if he lived.
Ye Xuan's threat wasn't weaker than the Dao Tomb at all!
Meanwhile, Bai Dizi said, "Wait for the Dao Ancestor to emerge from his closed door cultivation!"
True Martial closed his eyes slowly!
Three months!
The Dao Ancestor would be able to reconstruct his body in three months. Once the Dao Ancestor emerged, it wouldn't be so difficult for the Daoting to kill Ye Xuan then!
As for now, even though he could kill Ye Xuan, the Dao Tomb would act as soon as he did!
When he thought up to this point, True Martial took a deep look at Ye Xuan, and then he vanished with Bai Dizi.
Luo Hou and Ah Ku Wang showed up in front of Ye Xuan when the two had disappeared.
The experts of the Dao Tomb bowed when they saw them.
The experts of the Dao Tomb bowed.
However, Ye Xuan didn't move!
Luo Hou looked at Ye Xuan. "Why did you kill Fan Shuishui!?"
His voice carried a strand of invisible might.
Ye Xuan's face was expressionless. "He obstructed me!"
Ah Ku frowned slightly. "What did he obstruct?"
Ye Xuan said, "He obstructed me from killing someone!"
Ah Ku looked at Ye Xuan. "If you want to kill someone from the Daoting, then there's no need to kill him!"
Ye Xuan looked at Luo Hou. "From now on, the entire Path of Purgatory belongs to the Dao Tomb. Besides that, the younger generation of the Daoting is practically extinct!
I've done what Fan Shuishui couldn't! "
Luo Hou fell silent.
Ah Ku's eyes gradually turned cold. "You still haven't answered …"
Ye Xuan suddenly looked at Ah Ku. "Ah Ku, do you really want me to be so direct?"
Ah Ku frowned slightly. He was about to speak when Luo Hou suddenly said, "Go heal your injuries first!"
Ye Xuan nodded and left.
Luo Hou looked at Ye Xuan, who was leaving in the distance, with a complicated expression.
Ah Ku looked at Luo Hou, "What did he mean?"
Luo Hou said softly, "He was telling us that he, Ye Xuan, did what we couldn't do. Not only did he kill countless geniuses from the Daoting, but he also helped us obtain the mine in the Purgatory Battlefield!"
Ah Ku said in a low voice, "But I said he killed him …"
Luo Hou shook his head. "In that situation, if he didn't kill Fan Shuishui first, Fan Shuishui would definitely stand by and let him be surrounded by the Daoting experts. If he had been surrounded, he would have fallen into a desperate situation. Even if he won, it would have been a pyrrhic victory. At that time, his life would have been in Fan Shuishui's hands!
So, he chose to attack first and kill Fan Shuishui. Then, he lured the geniuses of the Dao Tomb to help him destroy those monsters from the Daoting. "
Ah Ku was silent.
Luo Hou said, "Before, I told you that Fan Shuishui had three choices. Unfortunately, he chose the last one."
As he spoke, he looked at Ah Ku, "This time, our geniuses were not as skilled. So, if we continue to ask him why he killed Fan Shuishui, we will only be humiliating ourselves. Do you understand?"
Ah Ku said in a low voice, "This person is too dangerous!"
Luo Hou nodded, "For a moment, I wanted to kill him!
But, thinking about it, what is Ye Xuan's goal?
It's to destroy the Daoting!
His goal is the same as my goal in the Dao Tomb!
We can cooperate with him!
And he also sees us as a partner to cooperate with.
Both of us need to understand each other.
He uses us, and we use him! "
Ah Ku said softly, "It would be great if he was from our Dao Tomb!"
Luo Hou nodded, "If he really was from our Dao Tomb, even if we can't destroy the Daoting, we will suppress them for the next ten thousand years!"
Ah Ku shook his head, "What a pity!"
Luo Hou looked up at the sky and said softly, "In three months, the Dao Ancestor should come out of seclusion!
I wonder if the Lord … "
In the previous battles between the Dao Tomb and the Daoting, the Dao Tomb had always been at a disadvantage because the Lord of the Dao Tomb was in seclusion.
Once that Dao Ancestor recovered from his injuries, if the Great Lord of the Dao Tomb didn't come out of seclusion, the Dao Tomb would be at an absolute disadvantage!
Ah Ku said in a low voice, "In about three months, the Dao Ancestor will be able to recover his body."
Three months!
The two fell silent.
After a while, Luo Hou suddenly said, "Why don't we let Ye Xuan go to the Heaven Realm Abyss!"
Ah Ku looked at Luo Hou, "With his current strength …"
Luo Hou said softly, "He can!"
Ah Ku said in a low voice, "The white-robed man is there!"
Luo Hou smiled, "Isn't it better to let Ye Xuan fight with the white-robed man?"
Ah Ku shook his head, "He is not a match for the white-robed man!"
Luo Hou said softly, "We underestimated him!
In terms of strength, he is definitely not a match for the white-robed man. However, the scariest thing about that guy is not his strength, but that he is full of evil tricks!
Let him fight with the white-robed man. Maybe he can help us salvage some of the situation! "
In the Heaven Realm Abyss, there were more than one thousand and two hundred super veins, and before,
Previously, the Dao Tomb occupied less than 300 mines because the white-robed man was guarding there.
The white-robed man!
The number one Divine General of the Daoting!
Hearing these two words, Ah Ku's expression gradually became solemn.
The white-robed man had fought with the Dao Tomb for countless years. Apart from that time when he lost to the Lord, he had never lost to the Dao Tomb!
Even Luo Hou could not do anything to the white-robed man!
It could be said that no one in the Dao Tomb was willing to face the white-robed man!
Ah Ku shook his head again, "I admit that in the future, Ye Xuan might be able to fight against the white-robed man. However, now, Ye Xuan is not a match for him!
Moreover, even if we let him go, he might not necessarily go!
If he doesn't go, we can't force him to go, can we? "
Luo Hou said softly, "Although we took advantage of the Dao Ancestor's seclusion to fight for some mines, in the Heaven Realm Abyss, we are still at a disadvantage!
Moreover, Yan Yaoyao needs someone to help her … Wu Man and I have to guard the formation outside, and we don't know where Wutian is. Right now, the most suitable person for the Dao Tomb is this Ye Xuan. "
Ah Ku still wanted to say something, but Luo Hou suddenly said, "Let him try!"
Ah Ku looked at Luo Hou, "Is he willing to go?"
Luo Hou nodded, "He will go!
Because he cares about the Five-Dimensional Universe! "
After saying that, he disappeared.
....
In Ye Xuan's room, Ye Xuan sat cross-legged on the ground. At this time, his injuries had mostly recovered.
Ye Xuan slowly closed his eyes. "Knowing Destiny, can you feel the Taoist scripture in the Tomb of the Tao?"
Ye Zhiming said in a low voice, "I could feel it before, but now I can't!"
Ye Xuan was silent.
Ye Zhiming said again, "How long will it take for you to break through?"
Ye Xuan shook his head, "It's very difficult for me to break through now."
Ye Zhiming suddenly said, "Can't you think of a way to contact the plain-dressed woman?"
Ye Xuan slowly clenched his fists, "Knowing Destiny … Sister Nian is so strong, but she still can't beat Qing 'er, and Qing' er can't solve the cause of my calamity …"
Saying this, he opened his eyes and looked into the distance, "Knowing Destiny … I'm very worried, worried about Qing 'er …"
....
In the depths of a distant starry sky, a woman in a plain dress who held a sword in her hand suddenly stopped moving. The space not too far away from her suddenly trembled, and then space split apart before a woman walked out from within the spatial rift!
Mu Niannian!
Mu Niannian looked at the plain-dressed woman and grinned, "Hi, long time no see!"
The plain-dressed woman looked at Mu Niannian, "He's dead!"
Mu Niannian nodded, smiled and said, "Yes!"
The plain-dressed woman was silent.
Mu Niannian suddenly smiled, "It's really not easy to find him. Speaking of which, I'm very worried about him, can he go back?"
The plain-dressed woman suddenly slashed into the distance, and in an instant, the distant starry sky split open.
Mu Niannian looked at the torn space. Gradually, she saw something, and her expression became more and more solemn. In the end, the smile on her face completely disappeared, leaving behind only a solemn expression that she had never seen before.
The plain-dressed woman looked at Mu Niannian, but did not speak.
Mu Niannian said softly, "No wonder you have to leave him … It's been hard!"
The plain-dressed woman did not speak, but walked away with her sword in hand. After a few steps, she suddenly stopped and said, "I'm sorry!
We siblings can't repay what we owe for now. "
Mu Niannian said softly, "Now I'm even more worried about him!"
The plain-dressed woman walked away with her sword in hand, "Even if the sky falls, I'll carry it."
Mu Niannian smiled, "The Great Dao has no end, and the future is endless. Take care, young lady!"
The plain-dressed woman did not turn back, "Never forget, there will be an echo. Young lady, we'll meet again!"
.....

Chapter 1370
Inside the room, Ye Xuan sat cross-legged on the ground. In front of him was a pile of fortune divine crystals!
There were more than a thousand!
This was because after killing the monstrous geniuses of the Daoting, he did not take everything for himself. Instead, he shared it with the geniuses of the Dao Tomb Grounds.
More than a thousand fortune divine crystals!
This kind of thing could only be found in the Daoting and the Dao Tomb Grounds. Even the Underworld did not have it, let alone the Fifth Dimension.
When he saw this fortune divine crystal, he suddenly understood something. It was not that the people of the Fifth Dimension were not talented, but that they lacked this kind of cultivation resource!
If the Fifth Dimension also had this kind of cultivation resource, then the people of the Fifth Dimension would definitely not be weaker than the people of the Daoting and the Dao Tomb Grounds.
No matter how talented they were, they still needed money!
At this time, Ye Xuan suddenly put away the fortune divine crystals and looked outside the door. Outside, a voice could be heard, "Is it convenient for you to come in?"
Luo Hou!
Ye Xuan got up and walked to the door. He opened it and smiled, "Senior Luo Hou, what's the matter?"
Luo Hou nodded slightly, "There's something I need your help with!"
Ye Xuan made an inviting gesture.
Luo Hou entered the room and sat to the side. He sized up Ye Xuan, "Have you recovered from your injuries?"
Ye Xuan nodded, "I've basically recovered!"
Luo Hou looked at Ye Xuan, "I'll get straight to the point!
The Dao Tomb Land and the Dao Court have always been fighting for the mineral veins in the Heaven Realm Abyss. For the past ten thousand years, the Dao Tomb Land has always been at a disadvantage. There are a total of one thousand two hundred and ninety-six mineral veins in the Heaven Realm Abyss, but the Dao Tomb Land only occupies three hundred and twenty.
The reason why my Dao Tomb Grounds is at a disadvantage is because of one person. "
Ye Xuan asked, "Who?"
Luo Hou said, "White robe!
The number one God General of the Daoting! "
Ye Xuan was silent.
He had heard of this person before. He was the strongest God General of the Daoting. He had only lost once against the Dao Tomb Grounds!
Luo Hou looked at Ye Xuan, "I want you to go to Heaven Realm Abyss!"
Ye Xuan picked up the teacup on the table and took a sip without saying anything.
Luo Hou smiled and said, "Before I came here, I sent someone to deliver one thousand fortune divine crystals to the Fifth Dimension!"
Ye Xuan suddenly asked, "Senior Rahu, is there anyone in the Dao Tomb who can fight against White Robe?"
Luo Hou was silent for a long time. "2000!"
Ye Xuan said, "Senior Rahu, I, Ye Xuan, am not greedy. I want that mine in the Purgatory Battlefield."
Luo Hou looked at Ye Xuan, not saying a word.
Ye Xuan continued, "Senior Rahu, at present, I'm definitely not White Robe's opponent. If I go to Heaven Realm Abyss, it's equivalent to risking my life. What do you think?"
Luo Yi sipped his tea and said nothing.
Ye Xuan continued, "In Heaven Realm Abyss, there are one thousand two hundred super mines!"
Luo Hou suddenly put down the teacup and took out a storage ring and placed it on the table, "It's yours!"
With that, he stood up and left.
Ye Xuan took a look at the storage ring. Inside the storage ring was the mineral vein.
Ye Xuan picked up the storage ring and left.
Ye Xuan returned to the Fifth Dimension. In the main hall, there were only Guan Yin and Ye Xuan.
Ye Xuan handed the storage ring to Guan Yin, "I'll give this to you for safekeeping!"
Guan Yin looked at the storage ring, and her expression soon became extremely solemn, "This is?"
Ye Xuan said, "Fortune divine vein, it can produce fortune divine crystals. This thing is what we lack the most right now!"
Guan Yin looked at Ye Xuan, "Where did you get it?"
Ye Xuan said, "Heaven Realm Abyss!"
Guan Yin was about to speak when Ye Xuan suddenly said, "Don't worry, I know what I'm doing!"
With that, he stood up and left.
Guan Yin looked at Ye Xuan's departing figure, silent for a long time.
Ye Xuan arrived at a courtyard. Just as he entered the courtyard, the door in the distance suddenly opened and An Lanxiu walked out.
An Lanxiu walked in front of Ye Xuan and looked at Ye Xuan.
Ye Xuan suddenly pulled An Lanxiu's hand and placed a storage ring in her hand, "It's useful to you!"
An Lanxiu said, "I'll go with you!"
Ye Xuan shook his head, "I need you to guard this place!"
An Lanxiu was silent.
Ye Xuan said, "Three months, we only have three months at most, do you understand what I mean?"
An Lanxiu looked at Ye Xuan, "Don't do anything stupid, we'll face it together when we return!"
Ye Xuan nodded, "Alright!"
An Lanxiu suddenly grabbed Ye Xuan's hand, "I'm serious!"
Ye Xuan smiled, "I promise you!"
An Lanxiu looked into Ye Xuan's eyes, "Don't lie to me, otherwise, I won't forgive you!"
She turned and left after she finished speaking.
In the courtyard, Ye Xuan was silent for a long time, and then he turned and left.
He gave the rest of the Fortune Divine Crystals to Aro and the others. With these Fortune Divine Crystals and Fortune Divine Veins, he believed that An Lanxiu, Aro, and the others' strength would definitely rise to a new level.
Ye Xuan arrived in the starry sky. He sat alone in the starry sky, and not far from him was Mu Niannian's main body.
Ye Xuan sat alone in the starry sky for an entire night!
The next day, Ye Xuan got up and left.
...
Heaven Abyss, Dao Mound City.
Luo Hou stood on an altar, and beside him was Ah Ku Wang.
Ah Ku Wang said, "He brought the vein back to the Fifth Dimension!"
Luo Hou suddenly said, "Ah Ku, how strong do you think Mu Niannian is?"
Ah Ku Wang was silent.
Mu Niannian!
This woman seriously injured a Dao Ancestor with just 30% of her strength!
This strength was indescribably terrifying!
At this time, Luo Hou said softly, "This woman is really terrifying!
Unfortunately, she chose to protect the Fifth Dimension. If she was willing to give up that place, with her strength, it wouldn't be difficult for her to destroy the Daoting! "
Ah Ku Wang nodded.
Mu Niannian being able to destroy the Daoting was not an exaggeration!
She could seriously injure a Dao Ancestor with just 30% of her strength. If she was at her peak, the Dao Ancestor would definitely not be her match!
Unfortunately, she didn't retract the power she used to suppress the Fifth Dimension.
At this time, Luo Hou suddenly said, "He should be at Heaven Abyss!"
Ah Ku Wang said solemnly, "Can he deal with White Robe?"
Luo Hou shook his head. "That's not important. What's important is that after he goes to Heaven Abyss, he will go all out against the Daoting!
If he can deal with White Robe, that's naturally good. If he can't, that's fine too. It's best if he dies at the hands of White Robe … "
Ah Ku Wang looked at Luo Hou. "Why?"
Luo Hou said softly, "We have always neglected one thing, and that is the people behind Ye Xuan!
Mu Niannian is not the only one behind him. If he dies at the hands of the Daoting, those people will not let it go! "
Ah Ku Wang said softly, "Can you find out who is behind him?"
Luo Hou shook his head. "I can't, and that's the scariest thing!"
Ah Ku Wang looked at Luo Hou. "After Ye Xuan went to Heaven Abyss, I'm a little worried about Yaoyao …"
Hearing this, Luo Hou frowned.
After a moment, Luo Hou said softly, "Tell her to be careful of Ye Xuan!"
Ah Ku Wang nodded and turned to leave.
...
Heaven Abyss.
When Ye Xuan arrived at Heaven Abyss, he had to admit that he was shocked.
The Celestial World Abyss was a huge abyss in the starry sky. From his position, the Celestial World Abyss seemed bottomless.
An abyss in the starry sky!
Before Ye Xuan came here, he did some research. There were no records of how the Heaven Realm Abyss was formed, whether it was the Dao Court or the Tomb of Dao. Anyway, the Heaven Realm Abyss already existed before these two forces appeared.
And in Heaven Abyss, there were more than 1,200 Super Creation Divine Veins!
More than one thousand two hundred!
What kind of concept was this?
How many Dao Proving and Dao Controlling experts could be nurtured?
In front of Heaven Abyss, Ye Xuan was silent for a moment, then he directly entered Heaven Abyss.
When Ye Xuan entered Heaven Abyss, Bai Dizi and True Martial Divine Lord also received the news!
In the main hall, Bai Dizi was extremely excited. "He actually went to Heaven Abyss!
He went to Heaven Abyss! "
He was naturally excited because White Robe was there!
Who was White Robe?
The First Divine General of Daoting!
He had only been defeated once in his life!
In fact, he had wanted to mobilize White Robe to deal with Ye Xuan, but the mineral veins in Heaven Abyss were too important!
White Robe had to guard them. Otherwise, Daoting would not be able to suppress that woman in the Dao Tomb!
One had to know that those mineral veins were the foundation of Daoting!
He had not expected that Ye Xuan would go to Heaven Abyss himself.
At this time, True Martial Divine Lord suddenly said, "The Dao Tomb deliberately sent him there!"
At this time, True Martial Divine Lord suddenly said, "The Dao Tomb deliberately sent him there!"
True Martial Divine Lord said solemnly, "Very likely!"
Bai Dizi shook his head. "Ye Xuan is no match for White Robe!"
True Martial Divine Lord looked at Bai Dizi. "He is growing every day!"
Bai Dizi was silent.
White Robe was very strong!
But Ye Xuan was also very monstrous!
Most importantly, Ye Xuan was very cunning!
This guy went to Heaven Abyss …
Thinking of this, Bai Dizi suddenly became worried.
True Martial Divine Lord suddenly said, "Inform White Robe and tell him to be careful of Ye Xuan!"
Bai Dizi nodded. "Don't be careless!"
True Martial Divine Lord suddenly said, "Did you find out who is behind him?"
Bai Dizi shook his head. "Not yet!
So far, we only know that there is a woman in a plain dress, a man in a green robe, the ancestral master of the Sword Sect, and the woman who fought with the Dao Ancestor. However, we can't find out who these people are! "
True Martial Divine Lord frowned. "Even we can't find them?"
Bai Dizi nodded. "This is not normal!"
True Martial Divine Lord said solemnly, "Go and investigate personally. You must find out who is behind him!"
Bai Dizi nodded. "Understood!"
True Martial Divine Lord said, "How strong is that woman in a plain dress?"
Bai Dizi said solemnly, "I don't know. I only know that she only uses one sword to kill people!
However, the people she killed were all below the Dao Confirming realm, so I don't know her true strength!
But she shouldn't be weak. She should be at least peak Dao Imperial. "
True Martial Divine Lord was silent for a moment. "Can you find her?"
Bai Dizi said, "I have already sent two Heavenly Generals, Qian Li and Divine Wind, to find her. It shouldn't be difficult for them to find her!"
True Martial Divine Lord looked at Bai Dizi. "What happens after we find her?"
Bai Dizi made a throat-slitting gesture …

Chapter 1371
Celestial Abyss.
The Celestial Abyss was divided into the Southern Abyss and the Northern Abyss. The Southern Abyss was the territory of the Daoting, while the Northern Abyss was the territory of the Dao Tomb.
As soon as Ye Xuan arrived at the Northern Abyss, a man appeared in front of him.
The man glanced at Ye Xuan. "The Celestial King wants to see you!"
With that, he turned and left.
Staying where he was, Ye Xuan kept silent for a moment. Then he followed.
Along the way, Ye Xuan constantly looked around. It was like a starry sky, and his vision was dim. Everywhere was emitting a strange star-like light, which was very beautiful.
What was worth mentioning was that the spirit energy here was very, very rich!
It was the richest place he had ever seen!
Even the thirty-six levels of heaven of the Daoting couldn't compare to this place!
This was a true holy land for cultivation!
At this moment, the man suddenly stopped. There was a pitch-black palace not far in front of the two of them.
The Celestial King Palace!
Ye Xuan looked at the black palace, and he sensed many extremely powerful auras around it!
The weakest was at the Dao Defense Realm!
At this moment, Ye Xuan understood!
Basically all the experts of the Dao Tomb were here!
It should be the same for the Daoting!
The man brought Ye Xuan to the entrance of the palace, and he made an inviting gesture before quietly retreating.
Ye Xuan entered the palace. The palace was very spacious, but also very cold!
At the front of the palace, Ye Xuan saw a woman. The woman wore a black robe. The robe was so black that it seemed to be weaved with ink. At the end of the robe, there were several red flowers. The flowers were as red as blood, and the redness was enchanting!
It was the Red Spider Lily!
A white ribbon was tied around her waist, and the ribbon perfectly outlined her slender and hot figure.
The woman wore her hair in two ponytails, and she looked very neat and tidy.
The woman's appearance was also very beautiful. Her facial features seemed to have been meticulously carved, and there was not the slightest flaw. It was unforgettable at first glance.
Yao Yao!
One of the Four Great Kings of the Dao Tomb, the Heavenly King!
The woman was also sizing up Ye Xuan. After a while, she slowly walked in front of Ye Xuan and said with a smile, "Luo Hou told me to be careful of you!"
Ye Xuan was silent.
Qian Yaoyao looked at Ye Xuan. "Before you came, I investigated you. I can't say that I know you like the back of my hand, but I have a pretty good understanding of you!"
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "What does Senior want to say?"
Qing Yaoyao turned and walked to the entrance of the hall. She looked into the distance and said, "Rahu told me to be careful of you, do you know that?"
Ye Xuan was silent.
Chi Yaoyao continued, "The Daoting is afraid of you, and so is the Dao Tomb. Do you know that?"
Ye Xuan was still silent.
Qing Yaoyao continued, "The Daoting wants you dead, and the Dao Tomb also wants you dead. The difference is that the Dao Tomb wants you to die at the hands of the Daoting. That way, the faction behind you will fight the Daoting to the death."
Ye Xuan looked at Qing Yaoyao and hesitated for a moment, then said, "Senior, perhaps we should be more tactful with our words!"
Qing Yaoyao turned and walked in front of Ye Xuan. She looked at Ye Xuan and said, "You killed the Divine Lady, and the Dao Scripture is still in your hands!"
Ye Xuan, "…"
Qing Yaoyao walked to the side and sat down. She picked up the teacup on the table and took a sip. "Let me guess, the Divine Lady wanted to marry you because she wanted to devour your bloodline!
However, she underestimated your bloodline. Your bloodline is superior to hers, so she failed!
After you killed her, you pushed the blame on the Daoting, so that the Dao Tomb would fight the Daoting to the death. That way, you would have more time to develop. "
Ye Xuan said nothing, his expression calm.
Qing Yaoyao put down the teacup and looked at Ye Xuan. "Luo Hou and the others must have guessed that you killed the Divine Lady, but they didn't expose you because you proved your value. Your value is above the Divine Lady's.
They want to use you, and you also want to use the Dao Tomb. Therefore, both of us hit it off, and everyone has a tacit understanding of each other. "
Ye Xuan walked to sit in front of Qing Yaoyao and took a sip of his tea. Then he said, "Senior, why don't we talk about something else?
For example, my handsomeness!
I can chat with senior for three days and three nights! "
Qing Yaoyao smiled. "You must be wondering why I'm telling you this right now, right?"
Ye Xuan looked at Qing Yaoyao and said nothing.
Qing Yaoyao got up and walked to Ye Xuan. She looked at Ye Xuan and smiled a moment later. "Welcome to the Celestial Abyss!"
With that, she turned and left.
Inside the hall, Ye Xuan slowly closed his eyes.
What did this woman mean?
...
Outside the hall, Qing Yaoyao slowly walked down the stone steps. Behind her was a woman in black armor. The woman's face was covered and she held a long saber in her hand.
Chi Yaoyao suddenly smiled. "Meng One, what do you think?"
The woman called Meng One said hoarsely, "Kill!"
Qing Yaoyao glanced at Meng One. "Why?"
Meng One said in a low voice, "A threat!"
Qing Yaoyao smiled. "Meng One, why break the dao?
Because the dao is unfair, so we break the dao! "
Meng One looked at Qing Yaoyao and said nothing.
Qing Yaoyao said softly, "Meng One, back then, Daoting treated us like this. If we threatened them, they would kill us!
And now, how are we treating Ye Xuan different from Daoting? "
Meng One said nothing.
Qing Yaoyao looked at the horizon. "Let's look at Ye Xuan from another angle. Do you want to listen?"
Meng One nodded. "Yes!"
Qing Yaoyao said softly, "Before we talk about him, let's talk about the Fifth Dimension Tendo, Mu Niannian!"
Mu Niannian!
Meng One was silent.
Who didn't know the Fifth Dimension Tendo?
That extraordinary woman who could kill a Dao Ancestor's fleshly body with just thirty percent of her strength. Her strength surpassed everyone's imagination!
Chi Yaoyao said, "In Daoting, she could have taken back her power and killed the Dao Ancestor, but she didn't do so. Because if she did, the Fifth Dimension would be gone!
And she didn't take back her power even in death … Meng One, such a powerful woman, gave up her life without hesitation for the sake of her beliefs and protectors. What about us?
How many people in the Dao Tomb still remember our original intentions and beliefs? "
Meng One said nothing.
Qing Yaoyao continued, "I admire Mu Niannian, but my greatest regret in life is not being able to get to know this woman!"
As she spoke, she looked at Meng One and said with a smile, "I admire Ye Xuan very much. I admire his sense of responsibility, his bravery, and even more, his resourcefulness.
After Mu Niannian left, from what he had done, it was enough to prove that Mu Niannian had not misjudged him.
From another angle, you will find that this person is loyal and loyal. Although he is unscrupulous, he has a bottom line! "
Meng One said in a low voice, "He killed the Goddess!"
Qing Yaoyao smiled and said, "Meng Yi, there are only two reasons why the goddess wanted to marry him. First, she wanted to devour his bloodline, and second, she wanted his Dao scripture. The goddess' death was completely her own fault. To put it bluntly, she deserved it!"
Meng One was silent.
Chi Yaoyao continued, "The Daoting wants Ye Xuan's Dao Scriptures, and the Dao Tomb also wants them. However, whether it is the Daoting or the Dao Tomb, both neglected one thing. After Ye Xuan obtained the Dao Scriptures, he did not keep them for himself, but shared them!
The Daoting wanted the Dao Scriptures, but in fact, they had a better choice. That is to help Ye Xuan and the Fifth Dimension Tendo to save the Fifth Dimension. This way, I can guarantee that they would easily obtain the Dao Scriptures. Because from all the signs, whether it is Ye Xuan or that Mu Niannian, they do not care about the Dao Scriptures!
However, the Daoting chose another path!
Not only did the Daoting choose another path, the Dao Tomb also chose another path! "
Meng One looked at Qing Yaoyao. "King, Rahu and the others …"
Qing Yaoyao said softly, "Do you know why?"
Meng One shook his head.
Chi Yaoyao suddenly laughed at herself. "Because whether it is the Daoting or the Dao Tomb, they feel that they are superior!
It is understandable for the Daoting to think this way. After all, they have always regarded themselves as the protectors of the Great Dao, and feel that they are the keepers of order between heaven and earth.
However, why does the Dao Tomb have such a thought?
Why did we break the Dao in the first place?
Because the Great Dao is unfair, so we choose to break the Dao.
Now, how is the Dao Tomb treating Ye Xuan any different from the Daoting? "
Saying this, she looked at Meng One and smiled. "Meng One, what is the original intention of the Dao Breakers?
It is to break the Dao and return a bright world to the world.
But now, many Dao Breakers break the Dao in order to become the next Daoting! "
Meng One said solemnly, "King, Ye Xuan is only using the Dao Tomb!"
Qing Yaoyao smiled. "When you use others, others will naturally use you!"
Saying this, she looked into the distance and said softly, "If I am not wrong, White Robe already knows that Ye Xuan has come to the Heaven Abyss!"
Meng One said, "What will he do?"
Qing Yaoyao smiled. "Guess!"
Meng One shook his head. "I can't guess!"
Qing Yaoyao laughed. "Pass down my order, have the Twelve Daoists come to see me!"
As she spoke, she walked towards the distance. As if she had thought of something, she suddenly stopped and said, "Besides that, have Ye Xuan come as well!"
Meng One bowed slightly before turning around and leaving.
...
The Southern Abyss.
A man suddenly appeared outside a pitch-black palace. He was just about to enter when a black clothed old man blocked his way.
The man hurriedly bowed slightly when he saw the old man. "Please notify Divine General White Robe that I have come on the orders of Starlord White Emperor and Divine Lord True Martial. I have something to tell Divine General White Robe!"
The black clothed old man turned around and left.
A short while later, the black clothed old man appeared in front of the man again. "Speak!"
The man hesitated for a moment and said, "Ye Xuan has entered the Heaven Abyss. Please kill him and remove a great threat to the Daoting!"
The black clothed old man said softly, "Understood!"
The man glanced at the black clothed old man, and then he turned around and left without saying another word.
After the man left, the black clothed old man looked at the white clothed old man in the hall. "Divine General, what do you think?"
After a long period of silence, a voice slowly drifted out. "Everything as usual!"

Chapter 1372
The main hall of the Southern Abyss.
At this moment, there were a total of 26 people within the hall, and all of them were at the peak of the Dao Defence Realm. Their leader was Chi Yaoyao, and Ye Xuan was amongst them.
During this time, some of them frequently sized up Ye Xuan.
Ye Xuan didn't speak and just sat there silently.
Chi Yaoyao glanced at them and said, "I just received news that another two low-grade mines have fallen into the Daoting's hands."
The expressions of everyone here turned gloomy when they heard this.
Chi Yaoyao picked up the teacup on the table by her side, walked over to the center of the hall, and then lightly swiped the ground with her left hand. A map suddenly appeared on the ground.
It was a map of the Celestial Abyss!
Chi Yaoyao opened the lid of the teacup, took a light sip, and then said, "Their next target is probably the Mang Mountain Mines."
The expressions of everyone here changed when they heard this!
The Mang Mountain Mines!
That was a top-grade mine!
There were over 1,000 mines in the Celestial Abyss, but there were less than 36 of them!
Moreover, the Dao Tomb only had 6 of them. It could be said that every single one of them was extremely important to the Dao Tomb.
On the other hand, a single top-grade mine could produce at least 100,000 Divine Fortune Crystals every single year. Once it was lost, then it meant that the income of everyone within the Dao Tomb would suffer a sharp decline!
Meanwhile, Chi Yaoyao glanced at them and asked, "What do all of you think?"
A black robed old man spoke abruptly, "Mang Mountain Mines can't fall into the hands of the Daoting!"
Chi Yaoyao smiled and said, "I know that it can't fall into the hands of the Daoting. I'm asking if all of you have any countermeasures!"
The black robed old man spoke in a low voice, "Who's the Daoting?"
Chi Yaoyao replied, "The White Cloak Army's vanguard, Baili Tu!"
Baili Tu!
The expressions of everyone here grew even gloomier when they heard this!
Baili Tu wasn't an ordinary person. He was the Daoting Divine General's vanguard, and he was called the Madman of the Battlefield. He was a complete madman on the battlefield. Moreover, he had a nickname on the battlefield — the Daoting White Robe Junior.
This was a person who gave the Dao Tomb a huge headache!
Seeing that everyone was silent, Qing Yaoyao smiled and said, "Why? Is everyone not saying anything?"
The black-robed old man said, "Celestial King, I presume you already have a candidate in mind. Speak frankly!
No matter who you have in mind, no one will refuse. "
Chi Yaoyao suddenly walked in front of Ye Xuan. She looked at Ye Xuan and said with a smile, "Let me introduce a new friend to everyone. His name is Ye Xuan and he comes from the Fifth Dimension. I think everyone should have heard of him!"
Everyone looked at Ye Xuan in unison.
Ye Xuan sipped his tea in silence.
Chi Yaoyao suddenly said, "The meeting is over!"
Everyone was stunned. The meeting ended just like that?
What the hell?
Qing Yaoyao looked at the crowd. "Don't you understand what I'm saying?"
Everyone hurriedly left. Ye Xuan also turned to leave, but Qing Yaoyao stopped him.
Qian Yaoyao smiled and said, "You stay!"
Ye Xuan, "…"
Soon, only Ye Xuan and Qian Yaoyao were left in the hall.
Qian Yaoyao looked at Ye Xuan with a spurious smile. "Are you panicking?"
Ye Xuan thought for a moment and said, "I can still hold on!"
Qian Yaoyao sat to the side and looked at Ye Xuan. "Why did you come to the Celestial Abyss this time?"
Ye Xuan looked at Qian Yaoyao. "What does Senior want to say?"
Qian Yaoyao smiled. "You can call me Yaoyao!"
Ye Xuan fell silent.
He couldn't see through this woman.
Chi Yaoyao said, "The Dao Tomb wants to sacrifice you. Do you know that?"
Ye Xuan said, "Why are you telling me this?"
Qian Yaoyao got up and walked in front of Ye Xuan. "How about this, you help me and I help you!"
Ye Xuan frowned slightly. "What do you mean?"
Qian Yaoyao smiled. "Baili Tu's goal is Mount Mang. You go and guard it for me. After that, I will give you ten percent of the annual output of Mount Mang's supreme-grade mine."
Ye Xuan fell silent.
Qian Yaoyao continued, "Ten percent is ten thousand fortune divine crystals. Ten thousand fortune divine crystals can help some of your friends reach the Dao Defense Realm!
Don't haggle, because if I give too much, others in the Dao Tomb will think otherwise.
Do you want this deal or not? "
Ye Xuan looked at Qian Yaoyao. "Why don't you let others go?"
Qian Yaoyao smiled. "Did you see that?
No one asked to go!
Why didn't they ask to go?
Because going to Mount Mang is to risk their lives!
Baili Tu is a famous madman. Who would want to risk their lives against him?
Wouldn't it be better to just sit at home and split the money? "
Ye Xuan fell silent.
Qian Yaoyao picked up her teacup and took a sip. "You took over a hundred spirit veins from the Daoting to the Fifth Dimension. Now that everything in the Fifth Dimension is recovering, the spirit qi is getting better and better. However, do you know what the Fifth Dimension lacks the most?
It lacks experts!
Without the fortune divine crystals, even if you have the Dao Scripture, you won't be able to help your friends reach the Dao Defense Realm. "
As she spoke, she glanced at Ye Xuan. "You too!"
Ye Xuan didn't say anything.
Qian Yaoyao continued, "There are many people in the Dao Tomb who want you to die at the hands of the Daoting because they are afraid that you will become a threat to the Dao Tomb when you grow stronger. The Daoting also wants you dead. It can be said that both the Dao Tomb and the Daoting want you dead. The only difference is that the Dao Tomb will not kill you first!
If you want to change your current situation, there is only one way, and that is to continue to prove your worth! "
Ye Xuan smiled. "Help the Dao Tomb obtain more spirit veins?"
Qian Yaoyao nodded. "Yes."
Ye Xuan slowly closed his eyes.
Qian Yaoyao smiled. "I guard the Heaven Abyss, and my situation here is not very good. If you can help me, I can promise you that as long as you are in the Heaven Abyss, I will protect you. Daoting will kill you, I will fight the Daoting, I will kill you, I will attack the Dao Tomb."
Ye Xuan looked at Qian Yaoyao. "Are you trying to trick me?"
Qian Yaoyao took a sip of spirit tea and said, "Do you have any other better choices?
If you do, I will respect your choice. "
Ye Xuan chuckled. "Miss Yaoyao, there is one thing I don't understand. I hope you can explain it to me!"
Chi Yaoyao said, "Ask away!"
Ye Xuan said, "I have no great enmity with the Dao Tomb. Why does the Dao Tomb want me dead?"
Qian Yaoyao looked at Ye Xuan. "You have the Dao Scripture. Not only does the Daoting want it, it is also what the Dao Tomb wants!
Moreover, you are too outstanding!
Outstanding to the point that the Daoting and the Dao Tomb fear you! "
Ye Xuan said softly, "I have no enmity towards the Dao Tomb. I just want to destroy the Daoting!"
Qian Yaoyao smiled. "What will happen after we destroy the Daoting?"
Ye Xuan fell silent.
Qian Yaoyao chuckled and said, "They see further than you!
Not only do they see the future!
But they also see the future!
You are at the Dao Validation Realm now. What if you reach the Dao Controlling Realm or achieve the Dao?
For example, if your Big Sister Nian is still here and she wants the Heaven Abyss's mine, do you think the Dao Tomb will give it to her or not? "
Ye Xuan said nothing.
Chi Yaoyao said, "No matter if it's the Dao Court or the Dao Tomb, we don't want a second person as powerful as Mu Niannian to appear because it will threaten our interests. Especially when you, Ye Xuan, have the five scriptures!
Do you think we will let you collect all the Dao Scriptures?
We won't! "
As she said that, she smiled slightly. "In this world, there are many times when being too outstanding is a sin, because you will threaten others, even if you have no intention of harming them.
For example, if a poisonous snake passes by on the street, even if it doesn't bite, people will still choose to kill it. Why?
Because it can threaten everyone, so it must die.
As for you, Ye Xuan, you are even more of a threat than a poisonous snake!
Of course, there is another reason why they want you dead. If you die at the hands of the Daoting, the people behind you will fight the Daoting to the death. At that time, the Dao Tomb will be able to reap the benefits. "
Ye Xuan looked at Qian Yaoyao. "Don't you want me to die at the hands of the Daoting?"
Qian Yaoyao smiled. "Why would I want you to die at the hands of the Daoting?"
Ye Xuan looked straight at Qian Yaoyao. "Why not?"
Qian Yaoyao smiled. "I cannot represent the entire Dao Tomb, and Rahu and the others cannot represent the entire Dao Tomb!"
Ye Xuan was silent.
Qian Yaoyao smiled. "Although you are not at the Dao Controlling Realm, your strength far exceeds that of an ordinary Dao Controlling Realm cultivator. Most importantly, you are smart!
If you help me, the Dao Tomb's situation in the Heaven Abyss will be better!
I also believe that you did not come to the Heaven Abyss for fun. In that case, why can't we work together?
I need you to help me, and you need me to help you fend off some people you cannot fend off right now. What do you think? "
Ye Xuan suddenly stood up and looked at Qian Yaoyao. "Happy working with you!"
The corners of Qian Yaoyao's mouth lifted. "Happy working with you!"
Ye Xuan turned and left.
Chi Yaoyao suddenly said, "Aren't you going to propose something else?"
Outside the hall, Ye Xuan's voice sounded. "If I propose it now, will you agree?"
Inside the hall, Qian Yaoyao shook her head with a smile. "What a smart guy!"
Then, she picked up her teacup and drained it in one gulp. "Meng One, pass down my order. From now on, all the experts of Mount Mang are under Ye Xuan's command."
Meng One turned and left. At this time, Chi Yaoyao said, "Give him ten Dao Breakers!"
The Dao Breaking Army. Not everyone in the Dao Tomb was a Dao Breaker. Many of them were experts that had been nurtured in the later stages of the Dao Tomb!
There was an extremely mysterious army in the Dao Tomb. This army was made up entirely of Dao Breakers, and they were extremely strong. Only this army could go against the White Cloak Army!
As for the Dao Breaking Army, even one of the Four Kings, Qian Yaoyao, could only mobilize fifty people!
This was the core army of the Dao Tomb, there was no other!
Meng One hesitated and was about to speak when Qian Yaoyao said softly, "You go as well. Do whatever he asks you to do."
Meng One didn't ask anything else. He turned and left.
In the hall.
Chi Yaoyao twirled the teacup in her hand and said softly, "Pass down my order to Luo Hou. Ye Xuan is now mine. No one in the Dao Tomb is allowed to have any ideas about him. Otherwise, don't blame me for turning hostile!"
"Yes!"
A voice suddenly sounded in the hall.
...









Chapter 1373
Ye Xuan headed for Mount Mang.
Along the way, Ye Zhiming suddenly asked, "Do you trust that woman?"
Ye Xuan replied softly, "I have no better choice at the moment!"
Ye Zhiming said solemnly, "This woman is not simple, you have to be careful!"
Ye Xuan nodded, "I know!"
Saying so, he slowly closed his eyes.
What did the current Five-Dimensional Universe need the most?
He was an expert!
In order to nurture experts, one must have the Fortune Divine Crystal!
The amount of fortune divine crystals he had obtained previously was too little, too little!
Now, the only place with fortune crystals was the Celestial Abyss, but this fat piece of meat had already been occupied by the Daoting and the Dao Tomb.
Could he snatch food from the tiger's mouth?
Ye Xuan was silent for a long time, then said softly, "Zhiming, I have always been curious about Sister Nian's level."
Ye Zhiming said solemnly, "Her strength is definitely above Dao Attainment."
Above Dao Attainment!
Ye Xuan frowned. What realm was above Dao Attainment?
And Qing 'er!
What level was she at?
Was there really no end to martial path and sword path?
At this moment, a mountain range appeared in the distance.
Ye Xuan collected his thoughts and looked at the mountain range: Mount Mang!
Ye Xuan was about to speed up when a hundred people suddenly charged in his direction.
Ye Xuan frowned. Soon, the hundred people were in front of him, but they did not stop, continuing to charge into the distance. But soon, they were stopped by a woman!
Meng One!
Yan Yaoyao's armed guard!
Behind Meng One were ten people, their auras as deep as the vast starry sky, extremely powerful.
Seeing Meng One, they hurriedly bowed respectfully.
Meng One looked coldly at them, "Mount Mang has fallen?"
The man in the lead said in a trembling voice, "Miss Meng One, Baili Tu has already killed his way to Mount Mang, Commander Mu Feng has been imprisoned, we …"
It was lost!
Meng One frowned, glancing at Mount Mang, then at Ye Xuan.
Ye Xuan also heard the man's words.
Mount Mang had fallen!
Ye Xuan was silent. No one knew what he was thinking.
Meanwhile, Meng One suddenly pointed at Ye Xuan and said, "He's your new commander!"
Everyone in the surroundings gazed at Ye Xuan with strange expressions when they heard this.
At this time, Meng One looked at Ye Xuan, "From now on, they will obey your orders!"
Ye Xuan shook his head. "Let them go back!"
Meng One frowned at Ye Xuan. "What do you mean?"
Ye Xuan glanced at those people, his face expressionless. "Look, they're already scared out of their wits. What's the use of keeping them?"
The experts here were instantly infuriated when they heard this, and the man who spoke earlier stared fixedly at Ye Xuan. "Are you insulting us?"
Ye Xuan nodded. "Yes!"
A ferocious expression instantly appeared on the man's face. However, he didn't attack, and he just stared fixedly at Ye Xuan.
Ye Xuan walked over to the man, and then he pointed at his chest, "Hit me!
Do you dare? "
The man clenched his fists tightly, but he didn't attack.
He hadn't forgotten what Meng One had said. Ye Xuan was their commander now!
Ye Xuan glanced at the 100 plus people here, "None of you have the balls!"
As soon as he finished speaking, he turned around and left.
Meanwhile, the man suddenly spoke furiously, "You're insulting us!"
The experts here gazed furiously at Ye Xuan as well.
Ye Xuan stopped moving, and then he turned around to gaze at the man and the others, "I looked at all of you. All of you aren't injured. What does that mean?
It means that Baili Tu seized Mount Mang without any effort at all!
As for all of you, none of you chose to resist, right? "
The experts here instantly revealed unsightly expressions.
They really hadn't resisted before they'd fled!
Meng One's expression instantly turned icy cold when he noticed their expressions.
Meng One's expression gradually turned cold when he saw everyone's expressions.
Ye Xuan sneered, "I said you guys have no guts. Am I wrong?"
With that, he turned around and left.
At this moment, the man suddenly stood in front of Ye Xuan and stared at Ye Xuan. "Do you know how terrifying Baili Tu is?"
Ye Xuan shook his head, "I don't know!"
The man said fiercely, "Then what right do you have to insult us?"
Ye Xuan was silent.
The powerhouses started to criticize Ye Xuan, and some of them even wanted to beat him up.
Beside him, Meng One's expression was extremely grim.
Ye Xuan looked at Meng One. "How should I address you, young lady?"
Meng One looked at Ye Xuan. "Meng One!"
Ye Xuan nodded. "Miss Meng Yi, did you just say that they are all under my control?"
Meng One nodded. "Yes!"
Ye Xuan looked at the man and the others. "I'm willing to give all of you a chance. Now, I'm going to reclaim Mount Mang. Are any of you willing to come with me?"
No one spoke.
The man sneered. "You're courting death!"
Ye Xuan suddenly drew his sword and slashed.
Hiss!
The man's head flew into the air before he could even react!
Everyone in the surroundings was stunned when they witnessed this scene.
Ye Xuan killed someone!
Meng One was slightly stunned as well. She hadn't expected that Ye Xuan would suddenly kill someone.
Ye Xuan glanced at them. "Protecting Mount Mang is your duty. However, all of you fled without a fight and surrendered Mount Mang to us. Let me ask all of you, do all of you have the face to go back?
Even if all of you go back, won't you feel ashamed when you face King Mang? "
Meanwhile, a man with a spear in his hand said in a low voice, "Baili Tu is very strong!"
Ye Xuan gazed at the man, "Losing isn't terrifying. What's terrifying is admitting defeat without even fighting."
As he spoke, he gazed at Meng One, "Miss Meng One, give the order that all the generals of Mount Mang flee without a fight. Inscribe the names of all the generals of Mount Mang on stone steles and place them before the grand hall of the Dao Tomb Hall for all the experts of our Dao Tomb to see.
Moreover, notify the entire Dao Tomb Hall! "
The expressions of all of them became extremely unsightly when they heard this!
Meng One glanced at Ye Xuan, "I'll make the arrangements!"
Ye Xuan nodded, "Let's go to Mount Mang!"
As soon as he finished speaking, he transformed into a ray of light that vanished into the distance.
Meng One glanced coldly at them, "What a disgrace!"
As she spoke, she led the 10 Dao Breakers behind her and left.
All of them didn't flee, and all of them fell silent.
Meanwhile, someone suddenly asked, "Who's that man?"
The man with a spear glanced at the ray of light in the distance, "He should be Ye Xuan!"
Ye Xuan!
Someone exclaimed, "The Ye Xuan who killed all the Daoting geniuses in the Purgatory Battlefield?"
Another exclaimed, "It's actually him!
He's that Ye Xuan who challenged the True Martial Divine Monarch …. "
Suddenly, someone asked, "Can he defeat Baili Tu?"
The man with a spear spoke ferociously, "Everyone, if we return just like that, then we'll really become the shame of the entire Dao Tomb Hall!"
As soon as he finished speaking, he charged forward.
Some of the others hurriedly charged forward as well.
However, there weren't many of them. There were less than 30 of them!
The others didn't choose to follow him!
As far as the others were concerned, charging forward was no different than giving their lives away!
...
Meng One suddenly appeared by Ye Xuan's side, "Just us?"
Ye Xuan stopped and turned around to look at the 10 people by Meng One's side. All 10 of them were looking at Ye Xuan with calm expressions.
Ye Xuan nodded, "That's enough!"
Meng One was just about to speak when the spear man and the others suddenly flashed over from afar.
There was a trace of surprise in Meng One's eyes as he gazed at the spear man and the others.
The spear man and the others walked over to Ye Xuan, and then he gazed at Ye Xuan, "We're with you!"
Ye Xuan asked, "What's your name?"
The spear man replied, "Zhao Jin!"
Ye Xuan nodded slightly, and then he gazed at Meng One, "Miss Meng One, order the 10 people behind you to kill all the others who didn't come!"
Everyone was stunned when they heard this.
Meng One was stunned as well.
Kill all of them?
Ye Xuan smiled when he saw Meng One not react, "So my words don't work?"
Meng One gazed at Ye Xuan, "This matter is of great importance. I need to consult the Heavenly King!"
Ye Xuan suddenly gazed at the 10 Dao Breakers, "Did the Heavenly King ask all of you to obey my orders?"
They nodded.
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "Now, I order you to kill all of those people and place their heads in front of the main hall of the Mausoleum of Ways.
The 10 of them bowed slightly, turned around, and left.
Meng One was just about to speak when Ye Xuan suddenly said, "Miss Meng One, I don't need you."
Meng One gazed at Ye Xuan. Ye Xuan gazed at Meng One, "I'd thought that Miss Meng One would be different, but now it would seem like you're the same."
As he spoke, he gazed at Zhao Jin and the others, "Is Baili Tu very terrifying?"
All of them nodded with extremely solemn expressions on their faces.
Ye Xuan pointed at himself, "Remember, my name is Ye Xuan, and I'll allow all of you to understand what true terror is."
As soon as he finished speaking, he turned around and left.
Zhao Jin and the others exchanged glances, and then they followed him.
Meng One had a gloomy expression on his face, and no one knew what he was thinking.
The 10 Dao Breakers did not disobey Ye Xuan's orders. They really killed all of the 70-odd people, and brought their heads before the hall of the Dao Mound.
They were placed neatly!
For a moment, all the experts of the North Abyss were shocked!
All of the 70-odd people had been killed under Ye Xuan's orders!
Countless experts arrived before the hall of the Dao Mound, cursing incessantly. Some even sought an audience with Qian Yaoyao, requesting that Ye Xuan's position as commander be immediately removed, and that Ye Xuan be killed to appease everyone's anger!
In the hall, Qian Yaoyao was leisurely drinking tea, and no one knew what she was thinking.
At this moment, a woman entered the hall.
It was Meng One!
Qian Yaoyao looked at Meng One, "He asked you to come back?"
Meng One nodded.
Qian Yaoyao smiled, "Why?"
Meng One said in a low voice, "He wanted to kill those 70-odd people, but I didn't agree, so he asked me to come back!"
Qian Yaoyao smiled, "What did I say to you before you left?"
Meng One suddenly raised her head, and in the next moment, she slowly knelt down, "Your Majesty!"
Qian Yaoyao slowly closed her eyes, "I treat you like a younger sister, but you've forgotten your status. Go back to the Dao Mound!
This place is not suitable for you! "
Hearing this, Meng One said in a trembling voice, "Your Majesty, can you …"
Qian Yaoyao looked at Meng One, "Do you know why he killed those 70-odd people?"
Meng One shook her head.
Qian Yaoyao said softly, "What is the greatest problem of the Dao Mound?
It's fear!
Fear of the White Cloak Army, fear of the White Cloak Army! "
As she spoke, she walked to the entrance of the hall, and looked at the people who were still cursing Ye Xuan outside. Her lips curled into a mocking smile, "Look, even now, many people are still cursing Ye Xuan, but they've overlooked the fact that those 70-odd people fled without a fight.
Why have they overlooked it?
Because in their eyes, we should have lost against the White Cloak Army, so it's normal for those people to flee without a fight … After all, the White Cloak Army is so powerful … "
At this point, Qian Yaoyao looked towards the horizon, a trace of excitement in her eyes, "I really like this Ye Xuan more and more!"
.....









Chapter 1374
Mount Mang!
At this moment, the Daoting had occupied Mount Mang!
Ye Xuan led the 30 plus experts up into the sky above Mount Mang. Besides them, the 10 Dao Breakers were there as well.
Ye Xuan looked down at Mount Mang from midair, and no one knew what he was thinking.
Li Jin and the others were looking at Ye Xuan from behind Ye Xuan.
They'd naturally heard of Ye Xuan. After all, Ye Xuan had led the geniuses of the Dao Tomb to annihilate Guan Shan and the others from the Daoting!
However, Baili Tu wasn't Guan Shan. He was an extraordinary expert who'd made a name for himself.
Could Ye Xuan defeat Baili Tu?
Suddenly, a powerful aura shot into the sky from Mount Mang, and then a man appeared in front of Ye Xuan and the others.
The man sized up Ye Xuan's group and was about to speak when Ye Xuan suddenly stabbed with his sword.
Hiss!
The man's head flew into the air while blood sprayed!
Everyone in the surroundings was stunned.
He killed him just like that?
He didn't even make any opening remarks?
Ye Xuan sheathed his sword. Meanwhile, a ray of blood red light suddenly shot into the sky from Mount Mang, and there was a blood red blade within it!
Li Jin and the others had solemn expressions on their faces when they witnessed this scene.
The madman, Baili Tu!
In midair, Ye Xuan suddenly stabbed with his sword, and a ray of cold light flashed.
Bang!
The blood red light was instantly blasted apart, and an expanse of blood red light surged through the sky.
Meanwhile, a man appeared in front of Ye Xuan.
The man's upper body was bare, his long hair hung loosely on his shoulders, and he held a blood red blade that seemed like it was condensed from blood.
Baili Tu!
People called him a madman!
There were over 30 more people standing behind Baili Tu, and every single one of them emanated a powerful aura of slaughter. It was obvious that they were iron-blooded warriors.
The White Cloak Army!
Li Jin and the others who stood behind Ye Xuan were simply like the difference between the heavens and the earth when compared to these 30 people.
Not just his strength, but his temperament as well!
Baili Tu looked at Ye Xuan and smirked. "You're Ye …"
Before he could finish speaking, Ye Xuan suddenly disappeared from where he was.
Baili Tu was stunned.
They're going to make a move just like that?
Aren't you going to start with a verbal attack?
Baili Tu did not think too much. He raised the bloody saber in his hand and slashed forward. A bloody light instantly flooded the sky. Within this bloody light, there was an extremely terrifying evil aura and killing intent.
Li Jin and the others behind Ye Xuan had a drastic change in expression as they retreated rapidly.
It was because they were unable to resist the murderous and vicious auras, not even at the edge.
The ten Dao Breakers did not retreat, nor did the thirty people behind Baili Tu.
Right at this moment, Ye Xuan suddenly stopped, and a mysterious force suddenly appeared.
Blood Realm!
The instant the Blood Realm appeared, the sea of blood was instantly absorbed by him, including the Evil Qi and killing intent!
Everyone here was stunned at the sight of this, and it included Baili Tu!
Baili Tu gazed at Ye Xuan with slight disbelief, "How could this be possible!?"
Ye Xuan slowly closed his eyes.
At this moment, he was quite excited!
Because he noticed that he was most suitable for the battlefield!
Especially the battlefield!
How much killing intent, evil energy, and blood was there in the battlefield?
But he could absorb all of them!
Baili Tu stared fixedly at Ye Xuan from afar. At this moment, there was a solemn expression in his eyes.
He was naturally aware of Ye Xuan.
It could be said that the Daoting's hatred towards Ye Xuan still existed within the Dao Tomb.
Meanwhile, Ye Xuan opened his eyes. His eyes were completely blood red, and when coupled with his white hair, Ye Xuan seemed like a demon!
Ye Xuan gazed at Baili Tu while his left thumb suddenly pressed against the hilt of his sword, and his sword trembled slightly.
Baili Tu suddenly vanished on the spot. A moment later, he appeared above Ye Xuan, and he slashed down with his saber!
There were no flashy movements, it was just a simple slash!
Ye Xuan didn't defend himself, and he stabbed with his sword instead.
Bang!
Hiss!
Under everyone's gaze, Ye Xuan's sword pierced through Baili Tu's chest. At the same time, Baili Tu's saber struck Ye Xuan's head. Ye Xuan's entire body shook violently. At this moment, cracks appeared on his head!
However, his physical body had forcefully withstood this saber!
But Baili Tu hadn't been able to resist Ye Xuan's sword!
Baili Tu stared fixedly at Ye Xuan, "An injury in exchange for a life!"
As he spoke, his figure gradually became ethereal.
He'd lost!
He hadn't lost in terms of ruthlessness, he'd lost in terms of physical strength.
It's over?
All of the experts present were dumbfounded.
The two of them had only exchanged two blows as soon as they'd met, and then the battle was over?
The thirty-odd people behind Baili Tu stared fixedly at Ye Xuan. None of them retreated.
Ye Xuan suddenly turned around to look at the dumbfounded Li Jin and the others. "What are you waiting for?"
Li Jin and the others came to their senses. They looked at the thirty-odd White Cloak Army soldiers hesitantly.
They were still afraid of the White Cloak Army.
Ye Xuan suddenly said, "If you're afraid, then you'll lose for the rest of your life!"
Li Jin and the others fell silent.
Ye Xuan looked at Li Jin and the others. "If you have balls, then you're a man. What is a man?
Men can cry, they can lose, they can even die, but they can't cower.
And now, look at yourselves. Can you even call yourselves men? "
Li Jin and the others had ugly expressions on their faces. Ye Xuan's words were as sharp as a blade.
But none of them dared to move!
The ten Dao Breakers were just about to attack when Ye Xuan stopped them.
These Dao Breakers were no weaker than the White Cloak Army soldiers, both in terms of strength and mentality.
He wanted to train Li Jin and the others.
Ye Xuan couldn't help but sigh when he saw that Li Jin and the others weren't going to make a move.
It was like when someone bullied you in the secular world, and you felt that you couldn't beat him, so you didn't dare fight back.
But did you think that bullying you would end after one time?
No!
He would continue to bully you!
Why?
Because he thought you were easy to bully!
And as long as you fought back, even if you lost!
He wouldn't dare bully you again!
Because you weren't that easy to bully!
He'd understood this very well back in Qingcheng.
One could lose, one could die, but one could never be a coward!
If you dare bully me, I'll beat you to death. If I can't beat you, that's fine. I'll beat you every time you come at me, and I'll beat you again.
Li Jin and the others didn't even have the courage to make a move.
Strength?
Actually, Li Jin and the others were at the Dao Validation Realm as well, and their cultivations weren't any lower than the White Cloak Army soldiers.
However, they were just like some people in the secular world. They were clearly no weaker than others, but they still didn't dare fight back.
Ye Xuan gazed at Li Jin and the others. "The Daoting and I are mortal enemies, but now, I respect the White Cloak Army, while I look down on all of you!
A strong person challenging a weak person isn't something to be proud of. A weak person challenging a strong person is a true man!
Leave and return to Dao Burial Mound City. Because you aren't worthy of following me, Ye Xuan!
I, Ye Xuan, don't associate myself with a bunch of weaklings! "
Li Jin and the others had extremely unsightly expressions on their faces when they heard Ye Xuan.
Meanwhile, Li Jin suddenly stepped forward and grinned fiercely. "Brothers, let's fight for our dignity. Today, we'll show Ye Xuan that we aren't weaklings. At worst, we'll just die. What's there to be afraid of?"
As soon as he finished speaking, he charged forward.
Behind Li Jin, the rest of the people also rushed out.
Meanwhile, the White Cloak Army didn't flee. Even though they were afraid of Ye Xuan, not a single one of them fled!
As soon as Li Jin and the others charged forward, the 30 plus others attacked as well!
It didn't take long for the battle to begin!
However, Li Jin and the others were immediately suppressed as soon as the battle began!
There was still a gap in their strength!
It didn't take long for the members of the Dao Burial Mound to start dying!
Ye Xuan still didn't show any intention of attacking.
He didn't feel pity for them. After all, none of them, including Ye Xuan, had come to the Celestial Abyss to play around!
They had to be prepared to be killed at any moment here.
More and more experts of the Dao Burial Mound were falling, but Ye Xuan still showed no intention of attacking.
If this continued, then it would only take an hour at most for the members of the Dao Burial Mound to be annihilated!
But up until now, not a single member of the White Cloak Army had died!
Ye Xuan just watched. He was waiting, waiting for the moment when Li Jin and the others only had the will to fight and no fear in their eyes.
At this moment, while there was the will to fight in their eyes, there was still fear!
That was exactly why Li Jin and the others hadn't completely forgotten about life and death.
What were they waiting for?
They were waiting for Ye Xuan to attack!
As far as Li Jin and the others were concerned, Ye Xuan would definitely attack.
Since the beginning, they'd been placing their hopes on Ye Xuan.
Meanwhile, Ye Xuan suddenly turned around and left with the 10 Dao Breakers.
Li Jin and the others were stunned when they witnessed this scene.
Ye Xuan left?
He left?
At this moment, some of them suddenly collapsed!
The 6 experts of the Dao Burial Mound had immediately turned around and fled!
They'd been waiting for Ye Xuan to attack. After all, Ye Xuan was their hope. Because they knew that they were absolutely unable to defeat the White Cloak Army. However, they hadn't expected that Ye Xuan would just leave!
Forget about them!
There was no hope left!
Many had fled!
However, over a dozen hadn't fled.
After Ye Xuan left, they knew that they would definitely die today!
Since they were going to die, then they intended to drag one of them down with them!
Meanwhile, Li Jin suddenly roared madly with laughter, "Even if I die, I'll change to another!"
As soon as he finished speaking, he charged forward.
At this moment, he was prepared to die.
The others were the same.
At this moment, the aura they emanated was completely different!
When one didn't even fear death, that was the moment one transformed.
Who wasn't afraid of death on the battlefield? Only those who weren't afraid of death wouldn't die so easily.
When enemies met on a narrow path, the courageous would definitely win!
Suddenly, a ray of light appeared here.
Hiss!
As soon as it appeared, the head of an expert from the White Cloak Army flew up into the air!
A moment later, rays of light crisscrossed through the White Cloak Army, and then the sound of slashing resounded incessantly. Every single slash resounded, and an expert perished!
The expressions of the experts from the White Cloak Army changed drastically, and they hurriedly moved closer. However, that ray of light tore through their formation with extreme ease.
A short while later, over 30 experts from the White Cloak Army were lying on the ground.
Even though they weren't a match for Ye Xuan, it wasn't very possible for Ye Xuan to instantly annihilate them. However, it was entirely possible when the Daobreakers were included!
Ye Xuan put his sword away and walked over to Li Jin and the others. At this moment, only 12 of them remained, and all 12 of them were heavily injured.
Ye Xuan gazed at Li Jin and the others, "From this moment onward, all of you will follow me."
Right at this moment, an extremely powerful aura suddenly appeared in the distant horizon.
Ye Xuan frowned slightly as he looked up into the sky. One of the Daobreakers by his side spoke solemnly, "I just received news that the Daoting has dispatched reinforcements!
It's the number one general of the White Cloak Army, Fu Su. He's the number one expert of the White Cloak Army, and he's extremely courageous. "
He paused for a moment before he continued, "He's brought 300 White Cloak Cavalry with him. They're the most elite cavalry of the White Cloak Army, and they can be said to be the most elite cavalry of the Daoting …. Besides that, there are also 6 Divine Monarch Realm experts …."
Anyone who could be conferred the title of Divine Monarch was a Dao Defence Realm expert!
Ye Xuan suddenly turned around and gazed into the distance. "We'll have to pay more!"
Li Jin and the others were stunned.
Dao Tomb City. Within a hall. Qian Yaoyao sipped her tea slowly in silence.
Ye Xuan continued, "The price is right. Daoting is useless!"
Qian Yaoyao stopped.
....
PS: We'll have to pay more!
Top!









Chapter 1375
Inside the hall, Qing Yaoyao remained silent.
Ye Xuan suddenly turned around and left.
He wasn't heading towards Mount Mang.
Meanwhile, Qing Yaoyao suddenly said, "40% of the profits from Mount Mang's top-grade mine!"
Ye Xuan stopped, turned around, and walked towards Mount Mang.
Within the hall, Qing Yaoyao looked outside the hall, "Can you do it?"
Ye Xuan didn't even turn around, "What do you mean?"
Qing Yaoyao was stunned, and then she shook her head with a smile, "Interesting …"
As she spoke, she got up and walked out of the great hall. At this moment, the experts of the Dao Tomb hurriedly came before Kun Yaoyao. One of them said in a low voice, "Celestial Monarch, that Ye Xuan is inhumane. He actually killed so many people of our Dao Tomb …"
Qing Yaoyao suddenly punched out.
Bang!
The old man hadn't even finished speaking when he was blasted into nothingness!
The surroundings suddenly fell silent!
Qing Yaoyao looked at the crowd and smiled, "Come on, continue!"
How could they dare to speak?
Qing Yaoyao glanced at them and smiled, "Of all the things I can't do, I'm number one in internal strife.
Send down my order. Anyone who dares to flee without a fight will be killed without mercy!
Also, everyone here today will be dismissed and immediately return to the Dao Tomb! "
The expressions of everyone here changed drastically when they heard this!
Return to the Dao Tomb?
Was she trying to drive them away?
The Heavenly Monarch's expression gradually turned cold, "If you're still here in ten breaths of time, I'll make you disappear completely."
The experts hurriedly retreated when they heard Qing Yaoyao.
Qing Yaoyao slowly closed her eyes, "Send down my order. All Unparalleled experts are to head to Mount Mang immediately. Once there, Ye Xuan will be the new commander of the Unparalleled Army. Seeing Ye Xuan is like seeing me!"
Unparalleled!
She only had five hundred bodyguards. Although they couldn't compare to Dao Breakers, they were the elites of the elites.
It didn't take long for over five hundred powerful auras to soar into the sky from the Dao Tomb City and head towards Mount Mang.
Qian Yaoyao opened her eyes and looked into the sky as she chuckled. "What a good 'the price is right, the Dao Court will be crippled' … What an interesting little fellow!
....
Mount Mang.
When Ye Xuan entered Mount Mang, he immediately sensed the pure aura of a Divine Crystal.
A top-grade ore vein!
At this moment, greed rose in Ye Xuan's heart.
If the Fifth Dimension also had this kind of top quality ore vein, then the Fifth Dimension would also have more experts. Most importantly, this kind of top quality ore vein would also bring great benefits to the Fifth Dimension!
Because the Spirit Qi was pure!
In the current Fifth Dimension, although the Spiritual Qi had recovered a lot, it had not completely recovered. In particular, the amount of Origin Qi in the Fifth Dimension was extremely small, and this Origin Qi was not something that could be solved with a few Spiritual Veins!
Although he was tempted, he knew that he couldn't covet the supreme grade spiritual vein now because neither the Daoting nor the Dao Tomb would give it to him!
He had to take it slow!
At this moment, Ye Xuan suddenly turned around. Not far away from him stood a man in a black robe, holding a folding fan in his hand.
Fu Su!
The expressions of the Dao Breakers by Ye Xuan's side gradually became solemn when they saw the person who'd arrived!
Fu Su couldn't be compared to Baili Tu because he was a core existence in the Daoting.
There were six old men behind Fu Su!
Six Divine Monarchs!
All of them were at the peak of the Dao Control Realm!
Moreover, there was a group of cavalry in the sky behind the six old men!
The White Robed Cavalry!
Ye Xuan glanced at Fu Su and said, "All of you move aside!"
Li Jin and the others glanced at Ye Xuan, and then they moved to the side.
At this moment, even though there was a solemn expression in their eyes, there was no fear!
The Dao Breakers had moved to the side as well!
Fu Su gazed at Ye Xuan from afar and smiled, "Young Master Ye, I've heard of your name a long time ago. I finally get to meet you today!"
Ye Xuan glanced at the group behind Fu Su, and then he smiled, "A one on one battle or a group battle?"
Fu Su gazed at Ye Xuan, "A one on one battle. It should be a one on one battle!
What about a group battle? "
Ye Xuan smiled, "I'll fight all of you!"
As soon as these words were spoken, Li Jin and the others were stunned.
A group battle?
Is he serious?
The Dao Breakers gazed at Ye Xuan as well, and they were extremely shocked.
Ye Xuan wants to fight all of them?
Fu Su gazed at Ye Xuan from afar, and the smile on his face had vanished!
Was Ye Xuan confident, or did he have a backup plan?
Fu Su shook his head. While Ye Xuan was a monster, it was impossible for him to defeat all of them.
It was a trap!
Fu Su glanced at the surroundings, but he didn't notice anyone else.
At this moment, Ye Xuan suddenly smiled and said, "Don't worry, there's no one else."
With that, he walked towards Fu Su with his sword in hand.
As he walked, Ye Xuan's body gradually turned red!
The power of his bloodline!
Ye Xuan used the power of his bloodline. But he did not go completely mad!
After activating the power of his bloodline, a powerful killing intent swept out like a tide.
Li Jin and the others changed expression and retreated!
Even the Dao Breakers were forced to retreat!
This killing intent was so terrifying that it could mess with their minds!
It could be said that Baili Tu's killing intent was like the difference between heaven and earth compared to Ye Xuan's killing intent!
One kill to prove the Dao!
When Ye Xuan had entered the Dao, he had used killing to prove the Dao, not the sword. It could be said that Ye Xuan's killing intent was above his sword essence. Of all those who had used killing to prove the Dao, only Ye Xuan had survived.
Killing intent, bloodline power, and the sword spirit. The present Ye Xuan could be said to be very terrifying!
In this state, he could even fight an expert like the True Martial Divine Lord!
Seeing Ye Xuan suddenly enter such a state, Fu Su suddenly said, "Retreat!"
Finishing, he and the people behind him retreated like the tide.
Retreat!
Li Jin and the others were dumbstruck.
They retreated just like this?
At this moment, Ye Xuan slowly closed his eyes. Soon, the power of the bloodline in his body gradually calmed down.
After a while, Ye Xuan returned to normal.
Ye Xuan looked at the sky. No one knew what he was thinking.
He had not expected Fu Su to suddenly retreat!
Ye Xuan turned and left after a moment of silence.
Seeing this, Li Jin and the others hurriedly followed.
....
At a certain horizon, Fu Su looked in the direction of Mount Mang. No one knew what he was thinking.
At this time, an old man suddenly appeared next to him and said gravely, "Retreating like this will affect our morale!"
Fu Su looked at the old man. "Elder Zhang, do you think the True Martial Divine Lord and White Emperor Star Sovereign are powerful?"
Elder Zhang stilled and then said, "Of course!"
True Martial Divine Lord!
The commander of all the armies in Celestial Abyss. It could be said that even White Robes had to listen to his orders!
As for White Emperor Star Sovereign, while he was not very good at fighting, his status in the Daoting was very high. He had appointed some of the Daoting positions.
These two, one civil and one martial, were the left and right arms of the Dao Ancestor!
At this time, Fu Su said softly, "White Emperor Star Sovereign and True Martial Divine Lord attach great importance to him, and think that he is a great enemy of our Daoting!
I have investigated this person. This person once fought his way into our Daoting. Even Divine General Kuan Bie died at his hands!
Also, he challenged the True Martial Divine Lord before. While he lost, he did not die! "
As he spoke, he slowly closed his eyes, and he pondered deeply for a moment before he said, "This person's strength is invincible in the Dao Proving Realm, and there are few in the Dao Control Realm who are a match for him. Especially when he enters that legendary state of madness, ordinary Dao Control Realm cultivators are utterly no match for him!
If we had attacked just now, there would only be one result, great losses.
Also, according to what I know, this person can grow in slaughter because he can absorb blood, and his sword can absorb souls … speaking of the sword, I almost forgot that his Soul Suppressing Sword has reached Dao Defense Realm … "
His voice was solemn.
The old man said gravely, "But if we retreat like this …"
Fu Su smiled lightly and said, "Face is not important. What is important is not to make unnecessary sacrifices."
The old man looked at Fu Su. "What do you plan to do next?
Mang Mountain cannot be given away! "
Fu Su said softly, "Elder Zhang, it is not about the supreme-grade spirit vein now!
It is about this Ye Xuan!
White Emperor Star Sovereign and True Martial Star Sovereign are right to worry. This Ye Xuan will become a great threat to our Daoting in the future!
This person must die here!
I have already sent people back to ask the divine general. Everything will be decided by him! "
Elder Zhang nodded slightly. As though thinking of something, he suddenly said, "Fu Su, if you fight this person, what are your chances of victory?"
Fu Su shook his head. "No chance!"
Elder Zhang was shocked. "How …"
Fu Su said softly, "If I had a thirty percent chance of victory, I would have fought him just now!
But I don't even have half, much less thirty!
Regardless of whether our Daoting admits it or not, he is the first of the younger generation in a hundred years. "
Elder Zhang was silent.
Fu Su seemed to have thought of something, and his expression gradually turned grave. "If this person really joins the Dao Tomb, it is not a good thing for our Daoting!"
At this time, a man suddenly appeared in front of Fu Su. The man bowed slightly to Fu Su. "Divine general greets the commander!"
Divine general!
Fu Su nodded. "Let's go!"
Finishing, he and the man disappeared.
....
The news that Ye Xuan had scared off the White Robed Cavalry quickly spread throughout Heaven Realm Abyss!
Ye Xuan!
This name could be said to be known by everyone in this Heaven Realm Abyss now, everyone knew it!
In Dao Tomb City, Ying Yaoyao sat on the stone steps of the hall with her legs crossed. Her eyes were slightly closed, thinking about something.
She already knew about Mount Mang.
This matter also shocked her a little!
She had not expected that Fu Su would choose not to fight.
Of course, she had not expected that Ye Xuan would dare to fight Fu Su and the others alone.
After a long silence, Ying Yaoyao opened her eyes. She looked towards the horizon and said softly, "White Robes, it's getting more and more fun!
What do you think? "

Mount Mang.
Ye Xuan came to the interior of Mount Mang. The interior of Mount Mang was a supreme-grade spirit vein. This spirit vein could produce more than a hundred thousand fortune divine crystals in a year!
More than a hundred thousand!
This was something that could nurture many Dao Verification and Dao Defense experts!
Ye Xuan glanced around and then turned around to leave.
There were some fortune divine crystals inside, but he did not take them.
There was no meaning in taking away a few fortune divine crystals.
Outside Mount Mang, more than five hundred people suddenly appeared in front of Ye Xuan. The man in the lead bowed respectfully to Ye Xuan. "By the orders of the Celestial King, from this moment onwards, we will obey Young Master Ye!"
Ye Xuan sized up the five hundred people and said, "Daoting, where is the nearest supreme-grade spirit vein?"
The man stilled and then said, "A thousand li to the south, Mount Politburo!"
Ye Xuan looked up at the horizon. "What benefits do I get from taking a supreme-grade spirit vein?"
Dao Tomb City, in front of the hall, Ying Yaoyao looked at the horizon. "What benefits do you want?"
Ye Xuan stretched out four fingers. "Forty percent!"
Ying Yaoyao stood up and looked at the horizon. "Thirty percent!
It is not that I am unwilling, but it is not good for you if I take too much! "
Ye Xuan was silent for a moment. "Fine!
But I need you to do me a favor. "
Ying Yaoyao smiled. "Fine!"
Ye Xuan asked, "Aren't you going to ask what it is?"
Ying Yaoyao smiled. "You are a person who knows what to do!"
Ye Xuan did not say anything else and left with the group.

Chapter 1376
In the sky, Ye Xuan rode his sword in silence.
When he saw the Dao Breakers and the White Cloak Army, he had an idea.
The Fifth Dimension also needed such a powerful army!
An army dedicated to protecting the Fifth Dimension!
The Sword Sect's Swordsman!
The Sword Sect's Swordsman had a solid foundation, and these people were no weaker than the Dao Breakers and the White Cloak Army in terms of temperament and talent.
The Sword Sect's people didn't lack hard work, but fortune crystals!
As long as they had enough fortune crystals, he believed that the Sword Sect's Swordsman wouldn't be any weaker than the White Cloak Army and the Dao Breakers!
Sister Nian's death made him understand that the Fifth Dimension couldn't be saved by one person!
He had to nurture more experts!
The Sword Sect's experts had all reached the Self Release realm. As long as they had the fortune crystals, he believed that it wouldn't be difficult for them to reach the Dao Validation realm. This was because he, Ye Xuan, had the Dao Scripture!
As long as they reached the Dao Validation realm, the Sword Sect's Swordsman wouldn't be any weaker than the Dao Breakers and the White Cloak Army!
Of course, the prerequisite was that they had fortune crystals!
Fortune crystals!
When he thought of this, Ye Xuan sped up.
Mount Bi Qiu.
There was also a supreme-grade spirit vein inside the mountain, which could produce more than a hundred thousand Fortune Divine Crystals in a year. With more than a hundred thousand Fortune Divine Crystals, many Dao Validation Realm experts could be nurtured, and even Dao Defense Realm experts could be nurtured!
Moreover, even if they reached the Dao Validation and Dao Defending realms, they would still need fortune crystals to nurture them. After reaching the Dao Validation and Dao Defending realms, ordinary energy was useless to them!
Because of this, the ore veins within the Heaven Abyss were so important!
It could be said that these ore veins were the lifeline of the Daoting and the Dao Tomb!
Mount Bi Qiu was also guarded by the White Cloak Army. There weren't many of them, only thirty or so. However, there was a Divine Sovereign standing guard.
The reason why there were so few people was because the Dao Tomb had never taken the initiative to attack. All along, the Dao Tomb had been passively defending!
When Ye Xuan and the others arrived at Biqiu Mountain, an old man suddenly appeared in front of Ye Xuan.
Divine Lord!
Dao Defense State!
The old man was stunned when he saw Ye Xuan, and then he said in a low voice, "Ye Xuan!"
Ye Xuan was about to speak when the old man suddenly said, "Retreat!"
With that, he turned around and disappeared into the horizon.
The White Cloak Army on Mount Biqiu also began to retreat!
At the sight of that, everyone behind Ye Xuan was struck dumb.
Ye Xuan was also slightly stunned.
Leaving just like that?
As if he had thought of something, Ye Xuan's expression gradually became solemn.
Daoting was afraid of Ye Xuan?
No!
They weren't afraid of Ye Xuan at all. At most, they would be fearful of him!
They'd retreated without a fight because they wanted to preserve their strength and avoid making unnecessary sacrifices!
Ye Xuan glanced at the sky. He knew that Daoting wouldn't attack now, but once he did, it would be the final battle.
Ye Xuan didn't think too much about it and led them into Mount Bi Qiu.
As soon as Ye Xuan entered Mount Bi Qiu, he immediately swept away all the Divine Creation Crystals within it!
There were more than 10,000 of them!
It was obvious that the old man and the others didn't know that Ye Xuan was coming, so they hadn't been able to take the Divine Creation Crystals with them.
Over 10,000 Divine Creation Crystals!
In the belly of the mountain, an idea suddenly occurred to Ye Xuan.
Daoting had more than 30 supreme-grade veins, and these veins would definitely contain Divine Creation Crystals …
On the other hand, he'd investigated before, and no matter if it was the Dao Tomb or the Dao Court, they would harvest it once a month. Because after these Fortune Divine Crystals were formed, they needed to be nourished in the mine for at least a month. Only then would the Fortune Divine Crystal be larger and its energy purer!
At this thought, Ye Xuan turned and left.
He left Mount Bi Qiu, but this time, he left alone.
There was a large mountain range three thousand li south of Mount Bi Qiu. This mountain range was known as the Southern Mountain Range. There was a supreme-grade vein in this mountain range, and there were many experts guarding this place. There were a total of six Divine Sovereigns and hundreds of White Cloak Army soldiers. Moreover, after Mount Bi Qiu had fallen, Fu Su's army and experts had immediately stationed themselves here because this place was closest to Mount Bi Qiu. It was obvious that they were afraid that Ye Xuan's next target would be this Southern Mountain Range!
And they would not give up on this supreme-grade vein in the Southern Mountain Range!
Ye Xuan did not go to the Southern Mountain Range. Instead, he went to the Taihang Mountains, a thousand li behind the Southern Mountain Range. There was also a supreme-grade vein in the Taihang Mountains.
Ye Xuan successfully snuck into the Taihang Mountains. With his current strength, it would be difficult for most people to discover him as long as he did not want to be discovered.
After entering the Taihang Mountains, Ye Xuan smiled.
There were more than ten thousand Divine Creation Crystals in the Taihang Mountains!
Without any hesitation, Ye Xuan swept all the Divine Creation Crystals clean. However, the moment he collected the Divine Creation Crystals, an angry roar suddenly rang out from outside the Taihang Mountains. In the next moment, dozens of powerful auras rushed into the interior of the Taihang Mountains.
At this moment, the interior of the Taihang Mountains was empty. Ye Xuan had long since disappeared!
Within the interior of the Taihang Mountains, an old man's expression was frighteningly gloomy!
The Divine Creation Crystals were gone!
They had been stolen!
The old man could not help but curse, "They actually stole them!
Shameless!
Ahhhhh! "
After leaving the Taihang Mountains, Ye Xuan did not go back. Instead, he continued to the next supreme-grade mineral vein in the Daoting …
Soon, one supreme-grade spirit vein after another in the Daoting was plundered clean!
....
The Divine Palace.
This was the residence of the White-robed Divine General and the core of the Southern Abyss.
At this moment, almost all the Dao Defense Realm experts in the Daoting in the Southern Abyss had gathered in the main hall.
Inside the hall, these Dao Defense Realm experts had extremely ugly expressions.
Ye Xuan was stealing the Divine Creation Crystals!
However, there was nothing they could do about Ye Xuan, who specialized in stealing Divine Crystals of Fortune!
Because they could not find Ye Xuan at all. Moreover, they also knew that even if they found him, a few Divine Emperors would not be able to do anything to this Ye Xuan!
So far, Ye Xuan had stolen fifteen supreme-grade mineral veins!
In order to prevent Ye Xuan from continuing to steal, they had already taken away the remaining Divine Creation Crystals in some supreme-grade spirit veins.
Although they had stopped the losses in time, this time, the Daoting could be said to have suffered a heavy loss!
Because Ye Xuan had taken at least two hundred thousand Divine Creation Crystals!
Two hundred thousand!
A Divine Emperor's monthly allowance was only three thousand Divine Creation Crystals!
But Ye Xuan had stolen more than two hundred thousand Divine Creation Crystals in one go!
Inside the hall, everyone was filled with righteous indignation, and their faces were terrifyingly gloomy.
At this moment, an old man suddenly appeared in the hall. The old man glanced at the crowd. "Meeting adjourned!"
Hearing this, everyone in the hall was stunned.
The meeting was adjourned just like that?
Where was the White-robed Divine General?
Inside the hall, many people were discussing, but the old man had already turned around and disappeared.
Inside the hall, everyone was dumbfounded.
What was this?
Those Divine Creation Crystals were given to Ye Xuan just like that?
Ye Xuan did not return to Beacon Hill. Instead, he went directly to the Heavenly King Hall.
Inside the hall, Qing Yaoyao looked at Ye Xuan with a smile. "Congratulations, you've made a fortune!"
Ye Xuan flicked a finger and a storage ring landed in front of Chi Yaoyao.
Qing Yaoyao glanced at it. Inside the storage ring were a hundred thousand Divine Creation Crystals.
She looked at Ye Xuan. "What are you doing?"
Ye Xuan said, "Protection fee!"
Qing Yaoyao blinked. "Protection fee?"
Ye Xuan nodded.
Qing Yaoyao looked at Ye Xuan. After a moment, she suddenly smiled.
She naturally understood what Ye Xuan meant!
Why could Ye Xuan act so fearlessly here?
Was there really no one in the Daoting who could restrain Ye Xuan?
No!
There was someone!
Disregarding everything else, White Robe was definitely able to suppress Ye Xuan.
However, White Robe did not make a move!
Why?
Because if White Robe made a move, Qing Yaoyao would definitely make a move!
Qing Yaoyao looked at Ye Xuan with a complicated expression.
She had not expected Ye Xuan to take out a hundred thousand Divine Creation Crystals. This guy was very greedy, but he was also very rational.
Greed was nothing to be afraid of, but insatiable greed!
Qing Yaoyao picked up the teacup beside her and took a sip. Then she said, "Daoting has not made any moves until now. What do you think?"
Ye Xuan said, "White Robe is waiting!"
Qing Yaoyao looked at Ye Xuan. "Waiting for what?"
Ye Xuan said, "Once he makes a move, he will definitely not give you or me any chance."
Qing Yaoyao looked at Ye Xuan and said with a smile, "You seem very calm!
Aren't you afraid? "
After a moment of silence, Ye Xuan asked, "If I fight White Robe, what's my chance?"
Qing Yaoyao shook her head. "You have no chance!"
Ye Xuan looked at Qing Yaoyao. "What about you?"
Qing Yaoyao said with a smile, "Four-sixty!"
Ye Xuan was silent.
Qing Yaoyao stood up and walked to the entrance of the hall. "As you said, White Robe has not made a move until now. This is very abnormal and not like his style."
Ye Xuan suddenly said, "If I were White Robe, Miss Yaoyao, do you know what I would do?"
Qing Yaoyao turned to look at Ye Xuan. Ye Xuan looked back at Qing Yaoyao. "If I were White Robe, I would gather all the troops here to fight Miss Yaoyao to the death and decide the winner in one battle!"
Qing Yaoyao was silent.
Ye Xuan walked in front of Qing Yaoyao and looked at her. "Miss Yaoyao, do you think he won't do that?"
Chi Yaoyao said, "If he does that, it will be mutual destruction!"
Ye Xuan said with a smile, "Mutual destruction?
No, I think that if he does that, your side will lose without a doubt! "
Qing Yaoyao looked at Ye Xuan. "Why?"
Ye Xuan said, "Momentum!
White Robe's name strikes fear into the hearts of the experts of the Dao Tomb.
If he brings the entire White Robe Army here, believe me, as long as Rahu and the others don't make a move, Miss Yaoyao, your side is definitely no match for them. "
He looked outside the hall and said softly, "Miss Yaoyao, the Daoting is very united, much more so than the Dao Tomb!
Just this alone is enough to prove that you are no match for them!
Let me guess, they're not afraid of you, but of the Great Lord of the Dao Tomb, am I right? "
Qing Yaoyao was silent.
Ye Xuan said with a smile, "Miss Yaoyao, think about it again. The Daoting has no Dao Ancestor, and the Dao Tomb has no Lord. What do you think White Robe and the others will do?"
Qing Yaoyao slowly closed her eyes.
Ye Xuan said, "White Robe and the others may not have done this before, but now that I'm here, they will have no choice but to do so!
They can't let me continue acting so arrogantly, can they? "
Qing Yaoyao looked at Ye Xuan and said with a smile, "You forgot to mention one thing!
If White Robe brings everyone here, and he doesn't want to fight, he wants to kill you. When that happens, do you think the Dao Tomb will protect you or not? "
Right at this moment, the space in the sky suddenly split apart, and then a man in a white robe walked out from within the split in space!
A spear, a white robe!
White Robe!
The strongest Divine General of the Daoting!
Down below, Qing Yaoyao gently touched Ye Xuan's arm with her right arm and said with a smile, "Are you panicking?"
Ye Xuan, "…"
At this moment, White Robe looked at Ye Xuan. "You have the God's Seal and are also a Dao Protector. Since you are a Dao Protector, I can give you a chance. If you are willing to enter the Daoting, I will let bygones be bygones."
Ye Xuan gently touched Qing Yaoyao's arm with his left hand. "Are you panicking?"
Qing Yaoyao, "…"

Chapter 1377
Was he panicking?
Ying Yaoyao was silent.
She knew that if Ye Xuan nodded and agreed, then Daoting would really let bygones be bygones.
Even if White Emperor Star Sovereign wanted to pursue the matter, he could not!
With White Robe's protection, no one could stop him except that Dao Ancestor.
However, she did not panic at all!
Because she knew that Ye Xuan would not join Daoting.
Ying Yaoyao looked at Ye Xuan and smiled. "You won't join Daoting, right?"
Ye Xuan smiled. "Yes!"
Ying Yaoyao looked at White Robe and smiled. "White Robe, did you hear that?"
White Robe glanced at Ye Xuan. "Take a spear from me?"
Ye Xuan looked straight at White Robe. "Alright!"
White Robe did not waste any words and stabbed with his spear.
Chi!
The space in front of Ye Xuan split open. At this time, Ye Xuan suddenly took a step forward and four domains appeared. At the same time, his entire body became covered in blood!
He had used all his trump cards!
Facing White Robe, Ye Xuan naturally did not dare to hold back. He attacked with all his strength!
Within the four domains, Ye Xuan stabbed with his sword.
Boom!
Ye Xuan was pushed back by the spear attack. He was pushed back thousands of feet, and when he stopped, he spat out a mouthful of blood.
In the sky, White Robe glanced at Ye Xuan. "Not bad!"
With that, he turned and disappeared.
Ye Xuan wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth and grinned.
At this time, Ying Yaoyao suddenly said, "What are you laughing at?"
Ye Xuan smiled. "He wanted to kill me with a spear!"
Ying Yaoyao looked at Ye Xuan. "Yes!
But you blocked it!
So, are you proud? "
Ye Xuan shook his head. "I'm laughing because I know what level my strength is at now!"
With that, he slowly closed his eyes.
In that exchange, he had lost!
But he was very happy!
Because he had discovered his own shortcomings!
Realm!
In that exchange just now, there was no battle technique involved. It was just a simple suppression of realm and strength!
If he reached the Dao Defense Realm, he would be able to put up a fight against Zhen Wu or White Robe!
Even now, he still had the strength to fight.
He couldn't win, but that didn't mean he couldn't fight!
Especially after activating the power of his bloodline, he could fight anyone!
He had to find a way to reach the Dao Defense Realm!
At this thought, Ye Xuan looked towards Kun Yaoyao. "Miss Yaoyao, can you do me a favor?"
Qing Yaoyao asked in a deep voice, "You want to reach the Dao Controlling Realm?"
Ye Xuan nodded.
Feng Yaoyao was silent.
Ye Xuan asked, "Is it very difficult?"
Chi Yaoyao didn't say anything.
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "The Tomb of Dao doesn't want me to reach the Dao Defense Realm?"
Ting Yaoyao nodded.
Ye Xuan smiled. "Understood!"
Ting Yaoyao looked at Ye Xuan. "You will become the Tomb of Dao's enemy?"
Ye Xuan said in a deep voice, "Miss Yaoyao, you should ask the Tomb of Dao, not me!"
Ting Yaoyao was silent for a moment before saying softly, "I'll be frank with you!
It's best if you don't reach the Dao Defense Realm now! "
Ye Xuan frowned. "Why?"
Ting Yaoyao looked at Ye Xuan. "Because Daoting won't let you reach the Dao Defense Realm. I'm willing to bet that Daoting will kill you at all costs if you try to reach the Dao Defense Realm now!
Moreover, the Tomb of Dao may have other intentions. After you reach the Dao Defense Realm, you will be at least ten times more threatening than you are now! "
Ye Xuan was already very terrifying now. If he reached the Dao Defense Realm, even the Tomb of Dao would be afraid of him, let alone Daoting!
Ye Xuan shook his head and smiled. "It's too difficult for me!"
Then, he turned and left.
Chi Yaoyao suddenly said, "Wait!"
Ye Xuan turned to look at Ting Yaoyao. She flicked her finger and a storage ring landed in front of Ye Xuan.
It was the storage ring Ye Xuan had given her. There were a hundred thousand fortune crystals inside.
Ye Xuan smiled. "This is the protection fee!"
Ting Yaoyao looked at Ye Xuan. "You seized two supreme-grade mines for the Tomb of Dao. This is my reward for you!"
Ye Xuan said in a deep voice, "This is a hundred thousand fortune crystals!"
Ting Yaoyao blinked. "Do I look like I need money?"
Ye Xuan, "…"
Ting Yaoyao smiled. "You really need this now. Take it!"
Ye Xuan didn't refuse. He took the storage ring. "Thanks!"
Then, he turned and left.
He looked at Ye Xuan in the distance in silence. No one knew what he was thinking.
....
Divine Palace.
Inside the palace, White Robe sat cross-legged on the ground. Behind him stood an old man.
The old man said in a deep voice, "Divine General, how is that young man?"
White Robe said, "Not bad!"
Not bad!
The old man's expression turned serious.
This was a very high evaluation!
The old man asked again, "Divine General, what are your plans?"
White Robe said softly, "Wait!"
The old man frowned. "Divine General, if we continue to wait like this, once Ye Xuan reaches the Dao Imperial Realm …"
White Robe opened his eyes. "Why should we be afraid of the enemy?"
The old man wanted to say something but stopped.
White Robe slowly closed his eyes.
...
Ye Xuan returned to the Fifth Dimension. The current Fifth Dimension was unprecedentedly powerful!
The spiritual qi was also unprecedentedly rich!
There were more than 160 dragon veins in the Fifth Dimension!
The origin of the Fifth Dimension, which was the origin spirit, was also slowly recovering. However, her recovery speed was a little slow. Now, she was also slowly spreading her origin power between heaven and earth.
In short, everything in the Fifth Dimension was getting better and better!
And in that starry sky, which was also the starfield where Mu Niannian's main body was located, more and more mysterious energy appeared in this starry sky and slowly gathered towards Mu Niannian's main body.
...
Sword Sect.
After returning to the Fifth Dimension, Ye Xuan directly went to the Sword Sect. At this time, the Sword Sect had 320 Swordsman. These Swordsman had all reached Release One!
True Release One!
Their current goal was to reach Dao Confirmation!
Currently, in the entire Fifth Dimension, there were still very few who had reached Dao Confirmation. Only Aro, An Lanxiu, and the others had done so with the help of Three Lives and Dao Scriptures.
However, with these Fortune Divine Crystals, Ye Xuan believed that more and more people would reach Dao Confirmation in the future!
...
Inside the Sword Sect's main hall, Ye Xuan sat cross-legged on the ground. In front of him were five Dao Scriptures!
There were nine Dao Scriptures in total, and he currently had five. If he could gather all nine, he could summon the Great Dao Spirit!
He naturally did not forget Sister Nian's words!
Gather the Dao Scriptures, awaken the Great Dao Spirit, and then let the Great Dao Spirit help him!
As if thinking of something, Ye Xuan suddenly asked, "Knowing Destiny, is the Great Dao Spirit very strong?"
Ye Knowing Destiny, "I don't know!"
Ye Xuan blinked, "You haven't seen it before?"
Ye Knowing Destiny said in a deep voice, "No!
The Great Dao Spirit is recorded, but I have never seen it before! "
After a moment of silence, Ye Xuan put away the Dao Scriptures. He looked at his right hand and slowly clenched it. A powerful force condensed in his fist.
Dao Fist!
He rarely used this Dao Scripture martial art, not because it was not powerful enough, but because it was too powerful!
As if thinking of something, Ye Xuan suddenly said, "Dao Fist, Dao Fist …"
Saying this, he opened his palm, and the Executing Heaven Sword appeared in his hand!
Why didn't he fuse his Dao Fist with his sword?
Just do it!
Ye Xuan slowly closed his eyes, and a powerful force suddenly condensed in his hand. In the end, this force began to gather in the Executing Heaven Sword in his hand.
The Executing Heaven Sword began to tremble violently!
Crack!
At this moment, the surrounding space suddenly cracked.
A trace of excitement flashed in Ye Xuan's eyes. He did not expect it to work!
Ye Xuan slowly raised the Executing Heaven Sword. In the Executing Heaven Sword, other than his own Sword Dao power, there was also the power of the Dao Fist!
He completely fused the two forces into one.
However, the force was too strong, and he felt that his body could not withstand it!
Ye Xuan quickly stopped!
He looked at the Executing Heaven Sword in his hand, and a moment later, he began again.
The power of Sword Dao and Dao Fist merged!
He wanted to create a new sword skill.
In order to control these two powerful forces, he began to use his Sword Domain to suppress them. However, he found that even the Sword Domain could not suppress these two forces, so he used the Death Domain and the Blood Domain!
Under the suppression of the three domains, he began to slowly control the power of the Dao Fist and his Sword Dao!
Dao Fist!
One fist contained the Great Dao.
After fusing the power into the sword, his sword naturally became a Dao Sword. One sword contained the Great Dao.
In the main hall, Ye Xuan slowly closed his eyes, and in his three domains, an extremely powerful force constantly shook.
Fortunately, there were three domains to suppress it, or the main hall would have been turned to dust.
Just like that, Ye Xuan began to slowly try to control these two forces …
...
Heaven Abyss.
Although Ye Xuan had taken two supreme-grade spirit veins, and Ye Xuan had stolen more than 200,000 Fortune Divine Crystals, Daoting did not take any revenge.
Outside Heaven Abyss, in the Heavenly Palace, Bai Dizi sat on a chair, thinking silently.
Not far from him was True Martial Divine Lord.
They already knew about what happened in Heaven Abyss.
At this moment, True Martial Divine Lord suddenly said, "Are we still waiting?"
Bai Dizi opened his eyes, looked outside the hall, and said softly, "Wait!"
True Martial Divine Lord looked at Bai Dizi. "What are you waiting for?"
In fact, he and White Robe were already prepared to kill Ye Xuan at all costs.
They did not want to see Ye Xuan reach the Dao Defense Realm!
Once Ye Xuan reached the Dao Defense Realm, it would be extraordinarily difficult to kill him!
However, his and White Robe's plan was stopped by Bai Dizi!
He and White Robe chose to respect Bai Dizi's insistence.
Bai Dizi got up, walked to the door of the hall, and said softly, "Qian Li and Divine Wind should be finding her soon!"
Divine Lord True Martial understood immediately.
The woman in the plain dress!
Bai Dizi had already sent people to look for the woman in the plain dress!
True Martial Divine Lord suddenly said, "So what if they find her?"
Bai Dizi said softly, "True Martial, I know you're worried, but forgive me for being blunt. Why did Daoting end up like this?
It's because we underestimated Mu Niannian!
I don't want to underestimate anyone!
Especially this woman in the plain dress!
I won't be at ease until I find her! "
True Martial was silent for a moment, then said, "Do you think this woman in the plain dress is stronger than Mu Niannian?"
Bai Dizi slowly closed his eyes, "Theoretically speaking, there shouldn't be … I don't believe there's a woman stronger than Mu Niannian in this world … Even if there is, it's impossible for us to meet all of them!"
People like Mu Niannian were already spiritual beings!
Could there be a woman stronger than her?
Bai Dizi would never believe it!
Just as True Martial was about to speak, Bai Dizi suddenly opened his eyes, "They found her!"
....
Somewhere in the distant starry sky, two middle-aged men were sprinting in the starry sky.
One of the men said excitedly, "Divine Wind, I can already feel her aura!
We'll be able to see her soon! "
The man called Divine Wind was also excited, "After a month of relentless searching, we finally found her!"
As soon as he said that, the two men's speed suddenly increased …
....

Chapter 1378
This was an unknown starry sky. The starry sky was deep and filled with twinkling stars that crisscrossed each other. At first glance, it was like an exquisite painting that was pleasing to the eye.
The starry sky was beautiful, but it was also frightening.
Because it was unknown!
This starry sky had no end. No one knew what was in it.
In the depths of this starry sky, a sword-wielding woman walked slowly.
The woman wore a plain dress that was spotless. She walked slowly like a lonely traveler.
No one knew where she was going!
She didn't know either!
However, she wasn't lost at all.
When a person has someone they care about, their life will have meaning.
Longevity?
She had never thought about longevity. In the past, her long life had only brought her loneliness.
Invincible?
She had been invincible for a very, very long time!
As for this endless universe and the endless end of the martial path, she wasn't curious at all.
She couldn't create this endless universe, but she could destroy it. No matter how powerful the universe was, it was nothing more than a strike from her sword.
As for the end of the martial path, if it really had an end, would it be able to stop her sword?
Right now, she only wanted to do one thing. She wanted to reach that end and kill that person.
When that time came, perhaps she would stop and look at the scenery of this world.
But now, apart from that person, everything else seemed unnecessary to her.
At that moment, the woman in the plain dress stopped in her tracks.
Not far in front of her was a huge black pyramid. The black pyramid was tens of thousands of meters tall and it towered in the starry sky.
In front of the black pyramid was a statue of a man. The man held a spear and looked up at the starry sky.
The woman in the plain dress stopped in her tracks and looked at the black pyramid.
At that moment, the starry sky behind her suddenly trembled. Soon, two men appeared behind her.
They were Divine Wind and Qian Li!
The two of them looked exhausted!
Naturally, they would be exhausted. For the past month, they had been searching for the woman in the plain dress without sleep or rest!
Fortunately, the heavens didn't disappoint those who worked hard. They had finally found her!
The woman in the plain dress looked at the two of them without saying a word.
At that moment, Divine Wind frowned. "Qian Li, something's wrong!"
Qian Li scanned his surroundings and his expression quickly darkened.
At that moment, the two of them suddenly realized that this galaxy was no longer the galaxy they were familiar with. The records of the Daoting didn't include this galaxy.
Where is this?
At this moment, both of them had the same question in their minds.
Qian Li suddenly looked at the plain-dressed woman. "Where is this place?"
The plain-clothed woman still did not speak.
Qian Li's brows knit together slightly, and he was about to speak when Godwind spoke solemnly, "Something's off!"
Qian Li looked at Divine Wind. Divine Wind stared at Qian Li. "Can you sense her?"
Qian Li looked at the woman in a plain dress when he heard this, and his expression quickly became solemn.
Because he couldn't sense the woman in the plain dress in front of him!
The plainly dressed woman was standing in front of him, but he couldn't feel her!
Divine Wind glanced at the woman in a plain dress and said, "We've probably encountered a formidable obstacle!"
After a moment of silence, Qian Li cupped his fists towards the woman in the plain dress. "Do you know Ye Xuan?"
He decided to use peaceful measures before resorting to force!
The person in front of him was clearly a tough one. It was better not to make a move first. It was better to be more stable!
Ye Xuan!
When she heard Qian Li's words, there was finally a trace of emotion in the woman's eyes and she nodded slightly.
I know him!
Qian Li looked at the plain-dressed woman. "Do you know our origins?"
The woman shook her head.
Qian Li said, "We're from Daoting. We're here on the orders of Lord Taibai Jinxing to look for you …"
The woman looked at Qian Li, and her voice was emotionless. "Are you courting death?"
Qian Li was speechless.
Divine Wind suddenly said, "Let's retreat!"
At this moment, he sensed danger!
As Heavenly Generals of Daoting, both of them weren't idiots. At this moment, both of them sensed that something was off when they saw the woman in a plain dress!
Danger!
That's the feeling!
Qian Li said in a low voice, "Are we leaving just like that?"
Divine Wind looked at the woman in a plain dress. "We might not be able to defeat her!"
Qian Li said in a low voice, "How will we explain to Lord Taibai Jinxing if we leave just like that?"
As he spoke, he looked at the woman in a plain dress. "Even if we can't defeat her if we join forces, it shouldn't be a problem for us to retreat unscathed!"
Divine Wind fell silent.
Actually, he still felt slightly uneasy.
The woman in front of him stood there without saying a word. She looked harmless, but he felt uneasy in his heart.
However, as Qian Li had said, how would he explain if he returned just like that?
At this thought, Divine Wind made up his mind. "Then let's fight!"
Qian Li looked at the woman in a plain dress and said with a smile, "Your Excellency, to be honest, the two of us are here to seek guidance from Your Excellency. Please enlighten us!"
The woman in a plain dress shook her head. "There's no need for guidance!
I'll grant you death! "
As soon as she finished speaking, she disappeared.
Behind her, both Qian Li and Shen Feng's bodies stiffened.
Both of their eyes were wide open and filled with disbelief.
Even in death, they didn't know when the woman in a plain dress had attacked.
A moment later, Divine Wind suddenly said in a trembling voice, "Daoting is in danger!"
Qian Li slowly closed his eyes. "Daoting is dead!"
As soon as he finished speaking, both of them completely disappeared into the starry sky.
They were directly wiped out!
...
The woman in a plain dress walked into the distance. When she approached the black pyramid, the statue in front of the pyramid suddenly opened its eyes and looked down at the woman in a plain dress. "Mortal!"
The voice was cold and emotionless.
The woman in a plain dress paid no attention to the statue and continued walking towards the black pyramid.
Seeing this, the statue frowned. However, he didn't make a move because he sensed danger.
The stronger one was, the more they could sense the power of the woman in a plain dress!
Behind the woman in a plain dress, the statue said again, "You don't have a divine body or Godhead. Why are you so powerful?"
The woman in a plain dress still didn't answer. She walked to the black pyramid and casually waved her hand. The impenetrable black pyramid immediately split open.
The woman in a plain dress walked slowly.
The statue didn't stop her because he didn't dare!
Soon, the woman in a plain dress entered the black pyramid.
But soon, she walked out again.
After coming out, she looked into the distance. At the end of the starry sky was a huge abyss, and in the abyss was a black pyramid.
The woman in a plain dress suddenly said, "What is this place?"
The statue hurriedly said, "Ancient God Abyss!"
The woman in a plain dress nodded slightly. She opened her palm and a sword suddenly appeared in her hand. In the next moment, an extremely powerful sword aura enveloped the entire Ancient God Abyss. In an instant, the entire Ancient God Abyss became illusory!
Seeing this, the statue was stunned.
She wanted to destroy the Ancient God Abyss?
Why?
At this moment, in the huge abyss, people suddenly appeared on the black pyramids. They were all illusory, not their real bodies.
Everyone looked at the woman in a plain dress. In their eyes, there was an unprecedented seriousness.
Every person standing on the pyramid was at least at the peak of the Dao Attainment Realm!
However, at this moment, everyone's faces were extremely solemn. In their eyes, there was only fear!
Deep fear!
Just one sword strike was enough to make them feel despair!
No one resisted!
No one dared!
No one could!
Under the shroud of the sword aura, the entire black pyramid in the Ancient God Abyss actually trembled and then slowly cracked!
The entire Ancient God Abyss was about to be erased!
And in the field, no one dared to resist!
At this moment, a black-robed elder suddenly appeared in front of the woman in a plain dress. The black-robed elder's aura was as vast as the starry sky, unfathomable.
Above the Dao Attainment Realm!
The black-robed elder bowed slightly to the woman in a plain dress and smiled bitterly, "I'm Su Zhe, may I know how I've offended you?"
The woman in a plain dress looked at Su Zhe, "No!"
Su Zhe was slightly puzzled, "Then why do you want to destroy us?"
The woman in a plain dress fell silent for a moment, "Your strength is too strong for my brother. It's not something he can bear at his age. So, all of you can die!"
Hearing this, Su Zhe and the others were dumbfounded!
We're strong and threaten your brother, so you want to kill us!
What kind of logic is that?
Is it wrong for us to be strong?
That's not human!
Suddenly, the sword in the woman's hand trembled, and in the next moment, the surrounding pyramids actually started to crack inch by inch.
Everyone's expression changed drastically when they saw this!
At this moment, Su Zhe hurriedly said, "Please be merciful!
Don't worry, we will definitely not become enemies with your brother! "
Dammit, what a joke!
You're so strong, how would we dare to become enemies with your brother?
Meanwhile, the sword in the woman's hand calmed down.
When they saw this scene, the expressions of the strong cultivators in the crowd instantly relaxed.
The woman in the plain dress looked at Su Zhe, and Su Zhe hurriedly asked, "Is your brother from the Dark Abyss?"
The woman in the plain dress shook her head.
Su Zhe heaved a huge sigh of relief in his heart, and he hurriedly said, "Don't worry, we will not become enemies with your brother, absolutely not!"
The woman in the plain dress thought for a moment, and then said, "I'm going to a very far place, and all of you are a huge threat to him, I'm worried …"
Su Zhe's expression changed drastically, and he hurriedly said, "Don't worry, we will definitely not become enemies with your brother!
We can swear on our souls … "
As he spoke, he hurriedly looked at the people in the crowd, "Swear!
Hurry up and swear! "
At this moment, Su Zhe was on the verge of tears!
Big sister, please let us go!
We don't dare to become enemies with your brother!
In the crowd, the people in the crowd hurriedly swore as well … They had no choice but to be cowards at this time!
The woman in the plain dress fell silent.
After she swore, everyone in the crowd looked at the woman in the plain dress, and the stone that had dropped in their hearts rose again.
The woman in front of them was so strong that it made them feel despair!
It was really despair!
Ordinary people could not feel the strength of the woman in the plain dress, but they could.
Just that one sword strike was enough to destroy everyone in the crowd!
That sword strike had already exceeded their understanding!
After a moment, the woman in the plain dress looked at the crowd, and then turned to leave.
Seeing this scene, everyone in the crowd heaved a sigh of relief.
At this moment, the woman in the plain dress stopped again. Seeing this, everyone's expression changed.
The woman in the plain dress waved her right hand, and a portrait appeared in front of Su Zhe.
It was a portrait of Ye Xuan!
The woman in the plain dress looked at Su Zhe, "This is my brother!"
Su Zhe looked at the portrait, and then hurriedly turned to look at the people in the crowd, "Look carefully!
Look carefully! "
Everyone hurriedly looked at the portrait … They looked very carefully …
The woman in the plain dress looked at the crowd, "Don't bully my brother!"
After saying that, she turned around and left.
Not long after, she disappeared into the starry sky.
In the arena, Su Zhe shook his head and wiped the cold sweat off his forehead. "Oh my god, who's the one bullying who … Is there still law in this world … Is there still justice in this world … Is there still justice in this world?

Chapter 1379
Two Worlds Abyss, Heavenly Palace, Grand Hall.
Bai Dizi, who was sitting on a chair, suddenly stood up. His eyes were filled with disbelief.
Zhen Wu looked at Bai Dizi from afar. "What's wrong?"
Bai Dizi slowly closed his eyes. "Divine Wind and Qian Li are dead!"
Dead!
Lord Zhen Wu was silent.
The hall was silent.
After a long time, Bai Dizi suddenly said, "It seems that this woman is stronger than we thought!"
Zhen Wu looked at Bai Dizi. "We can't wait any longer!
Ye Xuan will reach Imperial Dao if we wait any longer! "
Bai Dizi was silent.
Zhen Wu said, "I know you're worried about the woman, but we really don't have that much time now.
Ye Xuan is now at the peak of Dao Validation. If the Dao Tomb helps him reach Imperial Dao, it will be very difficult for us to kill him! "
Bai Dizi looked at Zhen Wu. "Zhen Wu, I suggest we figure out Ye Xuan's identity and the woman's identity first!"
Zhen Wu frowned. "Ye Xuan's identity?"
Bai Dizi nodded. "This person has a special bloodline, and I haven't found the origin of that bloodline …"
Then, he shook his head, his eyes full of worry.
The more he investigated Ye Xuan, the more he realized that Ye Xuan was not simple.
As if thinking of something, Bai Dizi shook his head again and sighed. He had thought that after Mu Niannian's death, it would be much easier for Daoting to kill Ye Xuan!
But now, he found that things were not as simple as he thought!
At this time, Zhen Wu suddenly said, "We can't wait any longer!"
Bai Dizi looked at Zhen Wu. Zhen Wu said, "Whether his background is simple or not, we have no way out!
We will kill him in the future, and we will kill him now. Why not kill him now? "
Bai Dizi was silent.
Zhen Wu continued, "Bai Dizi, you have to understand that once this person attains the Imperial Dao, even I won't be able to kill him!
But now, we only need to pay a small price to kill him! "
Bai Dizi said in a low voice, "The Dao Tomb?"
Zhen Wu said, "We will give the people of the Dao Tomb a choice. As for how they choose, it will be up to them!"
After a long silence, Bai Dizi no longer hesitated. "Kill!"
True Martial Divine Lord nodded and looked outside the hall. "Make all the necessary preparations!"
Bai Dizi nodded and got up to leave.
....
Somewhere in the starry sky, Ye Xuan stood with his sword in hand. His eyes were closed, and the Executing Heaven Sword was trembling slightly in his hand.
After an unknown period of time, Ye Xuan suddenly opened his eyes, and then he slashed with his sword.
Chi!
A streak of sword light pierced through the air.
In the blink of an eye, the starry sky within a radius of nearly 100,000 kilometers was reduced to nothingness.
Erased!
The Taoist Fist and the power of his Sword Dao!
He could now control both of these powers!
When these two powers combined, they were at least three times stronger than the Taoist Fist!
After the strike, Ye Xuan felt his body become extremely empty, as if it had been sucked dry!
Fortunately, his physical body was strong enough. Otherwise, his body would have been destroyed by this sword!
Ye Xuan looked at the Executing Heaven Sword in his hand. "Let's call it the Taoist Sword!"
This sword contained the Great Dao!
After a while, Ye Xuan sheathed his sword, looked around, and then turned to leave.
Ye Xuan returned to the Heavenly King City.
Chi Yaoyao stood quietly at the entrance of the Heavenly King Hall, as if waiting for Ye Xuan.
Ye Xuan walked over to Chi Yaoyao and was just about to speak when the space in the sky above the Heavenly King Hall suddenly split open. In the next moment, a middle aged man appeared in the sky.
White robes!
Behind the white-robed man, there were more than a thousand experts. Among them, there were a total of thirty-six Sir Gods!
36 Divine Lords!
Besides them, all the top experts of the White Cloak Army were here!
Ye Xuan looked at the sky in silence.
Chi Yaoyao smiled. "Are you panicking?"
Ye Xuan nodded. "A little!"
Chi Yaoyao said softly, "They're negotiating!"
Ye Xuan looked at Chi Yaoyao. "Luo Hou and True Martial?"
Chi Yaoyao nodded.
Ye Xuan smiled. "Miss Yaoyao, I want to see how they negotiate!"
Chi Yaoyao looked at Ye Xuan.
Ye Xuan said, "Can I?"
Chi Yaoyao nodded. "Yes!"
With that, she and Ye Xuan disappeared.
The next moment, the two appeared in a small pavilion. Ye Xuan saw a few familiar faces.
Bai Dizi, True Martial Divine Lord, Luo Hou, Ah Ku Wang!
Everyone was stunned by Ye Xuan's sudden appearance.
Chi Yaoyao smiled. "He wants to see how you negotiate, so I brought him here!
You guys continue! "
Luo Hou looked at Chi Yaoyao in silence. No one knew what he was thinking.
At this moment, Ye Xuan looked at Bai Dizi. "We meet again!"
Bai Dizi smiled. "You're a little late. We're done!"
Ye Xuan smiled. "Let me guess. You gave Senior Luo Hou a condition he couldn't refuse, right?"
Luo Hou suddenly said, "Ten supreme-grade spirit veins!
And we won't fight for twenty years! "
Ten supreme-grade spirit veins!
Ye Xuan smiled. "Does Senior Luo Hou agree?"
Luo Hou nodded. "We can't refuse!"
Just as he said, the Dao Tomb couldn't refuse. As long as the Dao Tomb didn't do anything, they would get the ten supreme-grade spirit veins.
Moreover, they could use the Daoting to kill Ye Xuan. As long as the Daoting killed Ye Xuan, would the people behind Ye Xuan let it go?
They definitely wouldn't let it go!
It could be said that once Ye Xuan died, the people behind him would fight the Daoting to the death. At that time, the Dao Tomb would reap the benefits!
In short, giving up on Ye Xuan had only benefits!
Luo Hou stood up and looked at Chi Yaoyao. "Let's go!"
Chi Yaoyao didn't move.
Luo Hou frowned.
Chi Yaoyao looked at Ye Xuan and smiled. "Aren't you going to say something?"
Ye Xuan was silent.
Chi Yaoyao walked in front of Ye Xuan and looked at Ye Xuan. "Have you given up?"
Ye Xuan suddenly looked at Luo Hou and smiled. "Senior Luo Hou, I have to say that you underestimate me too much!
What, I'm only worth ten supreme-grade spirit veins? "
Luo Hou looked at Ye Xuan. "Ye Xuan, you're a smart person. There are some things that you can understand without saying, right?"
Ye Xuan nodded. "I understand. However, there is something that Senior Luo Hou will definitely be interested in!"
Luo Hou nodded. "Speak!"
Ye Xuan smiled. "I can gather all nine scriptures!"
Luo Hou looked at Ye Xuan. "The scriptures are still in your hands!"
Ye Xuan smiled. "Senior is a smart person. There are some things that we don't need to say. What do you think?"
Luo Hou smiled. "Yes!
However, what makes you say that you can gather all nine scriptures?
According to my knowledge, you only have five right now, right? "
Ye Xuan glanced at them, and then he smiled. "Senior Luo Hou, I'll answer that question later!
Everyone, if I'm not wrong, then all of you are definitely very curious about my identity and background, right? "
Luo Hou gazed at Ye Xuan and didn't say anything.
Just as Ye Xuan had said, he was indeed curious about Ye Xuan's identity and background!
Bai Dizi suddenly smiled. "What? Are you going to introduce yourself?"
Ye Xuan suddenly opened his palm, and the Heaven and Earth Gourd appeared in his hand.
Luo Hou frowned when he saw the Heaven and Earth Gourd because he didn't recognize it.
However, Bai Dizi's expression changed drastically. "The Heaven and Earth Gourd!"
Ye Xuan gazed at Bai Dizi while a trace of surprise flashed through his eyes. This old man is really experienced and knowledgeable!
He even knows the Heaven and Earth Gourd!
Bai Dizi stared fixedly at Ye Xuan, "That place you're from!"
Luo Hou gazed at Ye Xuan, "What place?"
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "The Whirling World!"
Luo Hou's expression changed when he heard this!
The Whirling World!
Even the Daoting Sects and the Dao Tomb were quite unfamiliar to this place!
Because even they didn't know where the Whirling World was!
All they knew was that the Dao Scriptures had been passed down from the Whirling World!
Ye Xuan gazed at them and smiled, "To tell you the truth, I'm the Young Master of the number one sect in the Whirling World, the Whirling School. I've come to this world for the sake of gathering the precious treasure of my Whirling School, the Dao Scriptures!"
The Whirling School!
Luo Hou gazed at Ye Xuan with a doubtful expression!
He knew that Ye Xuan's forte was deception!
Bai Dizi suddenly smiled and said, "Ye Xuan, you say you're the Young Master of the Whirling School. How do we know if you're telling the truth or not?"
Ye Xuan looked at Bai Dizi, "If I'm not wrong, the Daoting Sects should have investigated my, Ye Xuan's, background. I'd like to ask, did you find out?"
Bai Dizi looked at Ye Xuan and didn't speak.
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "Do you know why you didn't find out?
Because it's very simple, I'm from the Whirling World! "
Bai Dizi stared fixedly at Ye Xuan, "Deception, continue to deceive!"
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "Do you know why I was able to gather the five Dao Scriptures?
Because they originally belonged to my Whirling World!
Do you know who that woman who stopped the Dao Ancestor was?
She's also from the Whirling World … "
Saying this, he looked at Luo Hou and said, "Senior Luo Hou, what's a mere ten top quality Spirit Veins?
When I return in the future, my Whirling School can give you twenty, thirty! "
Luo Hou was silent.
Bai Dizi looked at Luo Hou and said, "Do you really believe what he said?"
Luo Hou suddenly said, "As far as I know, when you went to the Daoting World, you used a little white fellow to absorb all the Spirit Qi in the Daoting World and took away more than a hundred Dragon Veins in the Daoting World …"
Ye Xuan said, "Senior guessed correctly. That was the Spirit Ancestor!"
The Spirit Ancestor!
Hearing this, Luo Hou's expression became extremely grave.
The Spirit Ancestor!
That was only a legend!
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "Her name is Xiao Bai and she's also from the Whirling World. When I went to the Daoting World last time, I asked her to help."
Saying this, he raised the gourd in his hand and said, "This gourd is called the Heaven and Earth Gourd and it's the number one treasure of my Whirling School. It contains the power of Heaven and Earth. Anyone who enters it, even if they're at the Dao Defense Realm, will turn into a puddle of blood!"
Saying this, he looked at Bai Dizi and said, "My Whirling School has already regarded the Daoting World as our mortal enemy. In a few days, an army will come. Old man, do you know how many people will come?
One hundred thousand!
One hundred thousand Dao Defense Realm experts!
By then, I'll flatten the Daoting World!
Just wait for your death! "

Chapter 1380
100,000 Dao Defense State!
Hearing Ye Xuan's words, everyone's expression became a bit strange.
Even Chi Yaoyao shook her head. What did 100,000 Dao Defense State mean?
The Daoting and the Dao Tomb combined didn't exceed 200 Dao Defense State!
100,000!
Was this a cabbage?
Seeing everyone's expression, Ye Xuan said, "You don't believe me?"
Next to him, Bai Dizi said indifferently, "Your mouth is yours. You can even say 200,000!"
Ye Xuan said with a smile, "Everyone, don't forget that the Dao Scripture came from our Whirling World!
The Dao Scripture used to be a complete Dao Scripture. In our Whirling World, the Dao Scripture's martial arts inheritance is the most complete.
In our place, Dao Proving is like a dog, walking all over the place! "
At this moment, Zhen Wu suddenly said, "Since the Whirling World is so strong, why don't you call them over to destroy the Daoting?"
Hearing this, Luo Hou looked at Ye Xuan.
Ye Xuan looked at Bai Dizi and said with a smile, "Bai Di Xing Jun, you're so smart. You should know why, right?"
Bai Dizi looked at Ye Xuan, "I don't know. I want to hear your lies!"
Ye Xuan: "…"
At this moment, Chi Yaoyao suddenly said, "There are two reasons. First, it should be very difficult for the Whirling World to come here, just like how we can't go to the Whirling World!
Second … "
Speaking of this, she looked at Ye Xuan, "They want to train you!"
Ye Xuan said with a smile, "It's not that they want to train me!
It's that I want to train myself! "
Chi Yaoyao asked, "What do you mean?"
Ye Xuan looked at Luo Hou and said with a smile, "Senior Luo Hou, do you think I, Ye Xuan, can destroy the Daoting?"
Luo Hou shook his head, "No!"
Ye Xuan asked again, "If not now, what about the future?"
Luo Hou wanted to say something but stopped.
The current Ye Xuan indeed couldn't destroy the Daoting!
But what about the future?
Who knew what would happen in the future?
Meanwhile, Bai Dizi said with a smile, "Ye Xuan, I've long since heard that you're good at bluffing, but I never expected you to be so good at it!
Holding a broken gourd, he said that he was the Young Sect Master of the Whirling World's number one power, the Whirling School. Why didn't he say that he was the Son of the Plane of the Nine Dimensions?
In any case, we have never been to the Nine Dimensions! "
Just as Ye Xuan was about to say something, the Gourd Immortal suddenly shouted, "Old man, who are you calling a broken gourd?"
Bai Dizi glared at the Gourd Immortal. "I'm talking about you!"
Enraged, the Gourd Immortal turned into a beam of white light and charged at Bai Dizi.
In the distance, True Martial Divine Lord suddenly swung his sword.
Boom!
The Gourd Deity's attack was blocked!
Immortal Gourd scolded, "Old man, have you heard of the Whirling Sect?"
Bai Dizi was expressionless. "I don't know!"
Immortal Gourd: "…"
Bai Dizi looked at the Gourd Immortal. "What, are you threatening me?"
Immortal Gourd said angrily, "Then have you heard of the Fifth Dimension Tendo?"
Hearing this, Bai Dizi frowned slightly. "What do you mean?"
Immortal Gourd sneered. "Let me tell you, the Fifth Dimension Tendo has been to the Whirling World, and she is the Honorary Elder of the Whirling Sect!"
Hearing this, everyone's expression changed.
Mu Niannian!
Damn, this woman is from the Whirling Sect?
Ye Xuan glanced at the Gourd Immortal. Damn, is this guy telling the truth?
Sister Nian has really been to the Whirling Sect?
At this moment, the Gourd Immortal said again, "Old man, do you know how strong the Whirling Sect is?
Let me tell you, the Whirling Sect has 100,000 Dao Controlling Realm experts, more than 10,000 Dao Attainment Realm experts, and several hundred Dao Attainment Realm experts!
And our Sect Master … Do you know how strong our Sect Master is? "
Bai Dizi gazed at the Gourd Immortal with an emotionless expression, "I don't. Why don't you tell me?"
The Gourd Immortal laughed coldly, "Let me show you how strong my Sect Master is!
Little Kid Ye, take out that sword from the top of the pagoda! "
The corners of Ye Xuan's mouth twitched. Dammit! When did the owner of the sword from the top of the pagoda become the Sect Master of your Whirling Sect?
Are you kidding me?
Meanwhile, the Gourd Immortal said, "Quickly take it out!
Let them see it! "
Ye Xuan thought for a moment, and then he withdrew the sword from the Founding Ancestor of the Fallen Immortal Isle. He passed it to Luo Hou, "Senior, please take a look!"
Luo Hou's expression instantly became solemn when he laid eyes on the sword!
One could discern a person just by looking at the sword!
The owner of this sword was absolutely not an ordinary person!
Bai Dizi and Emperor True Martial's expressions also became extremely solemn, especially Emperor True Martial, because he was a Swordsman. He was shocked when he saw the sword!
Ye Xuan looked at Emperor True Martial and said with a smile, "Emperor True Martial, you are also a Swordsman. Can you comment on this sword?"
Emperor True Martial glanced at Ye Xuan, but he did not say anything.
The Gourd Immortal suddenly sneered, "Comment?
Is he qualified? "
Ye Xuan smiled. As the Gourd Immortal had said, Emperor True Martial was indeed not qualified to comment on this sword!
The owner of this sword was on the same level as Qing 'er!
Ye Xuan suddenly looked at Luo Hou and said with a smile, "Senior Luo Hou, as the Young Sect Master of the Whirling Sect, I would like to cooperate with the Land of Dao Tomb. Do you want to talk?"
Luo Hou looked at Ye Xuan, "About what?"
Ye Xuan smiled, "About the Daoist scriptures and the top-grade ore veins!"
Luo Hou fell silent.
Meanwhile, Bai Dizi suddenly laughed, "Luo Hou, you don't really believe his nonsense, do you?"
Luo Hou looked at Bai Dizi, "Then can you explain this sword, this gourd, and the person behind it?"
Bai Dizi did not say anything.
Explain?
How?
He could not explain!
In fact, for a moment, he felt like he was from the Whirling World. That was the only way to explain everything that had happened!
But he did not believe Ye Xuan!
His intuition told him that Ye Xuan and the gourd were fooling him!
Luo Hou glanced at Bai Dizi and said, "Bai Di Xing, the Land of Dao Tomb has been investigating Ye Xuan's background. I believe that your Daoting has been investigating as well!
But we could not find anything!
He and the person behind him are too mysterious!
Almost untraceable!
But if Ye Xuan is from the Whirling World, then everything can be explained!
What do you think? "
Daoting looked at Luo Hou, "Luo Hou, he killed the Divine Lady!"
Luo Hou turned to look at Ye Xuan, "Did you kill the Divine Lady?"
Ye Xuan hurriedly shook his head, "I didn't kill her, Daoting killed her!"
Luo Hou looked at Bai Di Xing, "Daoting killed her!"
Bai Di Xing looked at Ye Xuan and sneered, "Ye Xuan, you are an outstanding person. What? You dare to do it, but you don't dare to admit it?"
Ye Xuan smiled, "Bai Di Xing, then tell me, why did I kill the Divine Lady?
What reason do I have to kill the Divine Lady? "
Bai Dizi looked at Ye Xuan for a moment, then turned to look at Luo Hou, "It seems that the Dao Tomb wants to protect Ye Xuan!"
Luo Hou looked at Ye Xuan and smiled, "Young master Ye, do you have anything to say?"
Ye Xuan smiled, "If the Dao Scripture is gathered, I will share it with the Dao Tomb. I will keep my promise!"
Luo Hou smiled, "I believe you!"
He still believed in Ye Xuan's character, because Ye Xuan had previously shared the Dao Scripture with everyone in the Fifth Dimension!
Both White Emperor's and Zhen Wu's faces darkened when they saw this.
Luo Hou changed his mind!
Why did Luo Hou change his mind?
Simple, benefits!
If Mu Niannian was still here, even if Ye Xuan did not move out of the Whirling World, he would still choose to ally with the Fifth Dimension.
But Mu Niannian was not here!
Only Ye Xuan's Fifth Dimension had no value. Instead, Ye Xuan might become a great enemy in the future.
Therefore, he chose to give up on Ye Xuan. Giving up on Ye Xuan could only bring him benefits!
But now, he chose to help Ye Xuan!
Because of Ye Xuan's identity!
The young master of the Whirling World!
When a person's strength reached a certain level, others would not see him as a threat. Instead, they would think of ways to become his ally.
And having a backer was also a kind of strength!
Bai Dizi suddenly looked at Ye Xuan and smiled, "Ye Xuan, this is the first time I've seen someone with such a strong mouth!
With just a few words, you changed your fate!
If the Three Thousand Great Daos had a Dao of the Mouth, you could definitely achieve Dao! "
Ye Xuan looked at Bai Dizi and smiled, "Bai Di Xing Jun, I know that you have been investigating my bloodline power and the plain-dressed woman!
But I want to ask, have you found anything? "
Bai Dizi did not say anything.
Ye Xuan smiled, "It seems that you haven't. But now that I have taken the initiative to tell you my origin, you are not happy. Why is that?"
Bai Dizi shook his head and smiled, "Ye Xuan, it is impossible for you to collect all the Dao Scriptures, because I, the Daoting, have two Dao Scriptures!"
Ye Xuan looked at Bai Dizi, "The day your Daoting is destroyed is the day I obtain the Dao Scriptures!"
Destroy the Daoting!
Bai Dizi narrowed his eyes, "You think you can do it?"
Ye Xuan smiled and turned to look at Luo Hou, "Senior Luo Hou, let's go!"
Luo Hou nodded.
Right when Ye Xuan and the others were about to leave, a white figure suddenly appeared before them.
A white robe!
Luo Hou's right hand that was hidden behind his back couldn't help but clench tightly when he saw the white robe.
Along with the appearance of the white robe, countless experts suddenly appeared in the surroundings.
The White Robe Army!
There were 36 Divine Monarchs amongst them!
Practically all the experts of the Daoting in the Twoworld Abyss were here!
Meanwhile, a few hundred experts suddenly appeared behind Luo Hou and the others!
All of them were Dao Breakers!
The white robe gazed at Ye Xuan, "You must die today!"
As soon as he finished speaking, the spear in his hand suddenly transformed into a ray of white light that stabbed forward!
The might of this spear could destroy the world!
At the instant that the white robe attacked, Luo Hou suddenly smashed his fist forward!
Bang!
This punch caused the world here to become illusory!
Rumble!
An enormous explosion resounded, and then everyone here was blasted back repeatedly!
The white robe retreated by over 30m while Luo Hou retreated by over 60m!
After the two of them stopped, the white robe gazed at Zhen Wu, "Stop wasting time!
Let's resolve everything today! "
As soon as he finished speaking, he charged at Luo Hou, and his spear swept through everything before him!
Suddenly, Ye Xuan turned around and fled.
Everyone here was stunned by this scene.
Meanwhile, Star Monarch Bai Di's expression changed drastically, "Shit! He's going to act recklessly!
Quickly stop him …. "
Because Ye Xuan was fleeing towards the divine palace.
.....









Chapter 1381
Now that all the experts of the Abyss of Two Worlds were here, who in the Divine Palace could stop Ye Xuan?
Ye Xuan was trying to take advantage of the situation!
Zhen Wu was about to stop Ye Xuan when Chi Yaoyao suddenly stood in front of him.
Chi Yaoyao smiled, "Zhen Wu, let's fight?"
Zhen Wu was about to speak when Chi Yaoyao charged over!
It didn't take long for a battle to break out!
Meanwhile, Bai Dizi was burning with anxiety!
Dammit!
Ye Xuan was trying to take advantage of the situation!
He was familiar with Ye Xuan's style. Once Ye Xuan went to the Divine Palace, nothing would be left of the Divine Palace!
Most importantly, all the top experts were here, and no one was a match for Ye Xuan!
He wanted both sides to stop, but the initiative was no longer in the hands of the Daoting!
Whether they fought or made peace depended on the Dao Tomb!
For a time, Bai Dizi's expression was unsightly to the extreme!
...
The Divine Palace!
During the battle with the Daoting, the first place Ye Xuan thought of was the Divine Palace!
There definitely weren't many experts in the Divine Palace right now!
When Ye Xuan arrived at the Divine Palace, a few dozen powerful auras locked onto Ye Xuan!
All of them were at the Dao Verification Realm!
There wasn't a single Dao Control Realm expert!
Ye Xuan walked towards the Divine Palace. Meanwhile, a man suddenly appeared in front of Ye Xuan.
Fu Su!
Fu Su's heart sank when he saw Ye Xuan. Something's wrong!
Almost all the experts of the Daoting had gone to kill Ye Xuan, but now, Ye Xuan had appeared in the Divine Palace!
Obviously, the Dao Tomb had interfered!
Ye Xuan ignored Fu Su and walked towards the divine palace. He knew that there was a top grade mine under the divine palace, and the largest spirit vein in Daoting!
At this time, Fu Su suddenly blocked in front of Ye Xuan. He was about to speak when a voice sounded in his mind. "Everyone from the Shen Palace, retreat!"
The voice of Bai Dizi!
Right now, there was no one in the God Palace who could stop Ye Xuan. Attacking Ye Xuan would only be a meaningless sacrifice!
Fu Su glanced at Ye Xuan. He did not refuse Bai Dizi's order and retreated to the side!
Ye Xuan did not choose to kill anyone. What he was thinking about now was that supreme-grade spiritual vein!
With no one stopping him, Ye Xuan rushed directly to the underground of the Divine Palace. He saw the supreme-grade mineral vein.
There were more than fifty thousand Fortune Divine Crystals in this top-grade ore vein!
Without any hesitation, Ye Xuan put away the more than fifty thousand Divine Crystals of Fortune!
But this was not the end!
Ye Xuan looked around. In the next moment, his palm opened. A great power suddenly gathered!
He was going to move the entire ore vein away!
For a moment, the entire Divine Palace was shaking.
Outside the Divine Palace, Fu Su and the others changed expression when they saw that Ye Xuan was going to move the ore vein away!
At this time, Bai Dizi, who was hundreds of thousands of li away, also received the news.
When he heard the news, Bai Dizi could not help but curse. "Ye Xuan!
Are you a bandit?
Ahhhh!
You're either robbing or stealing!
Are you a person?
Anger this Old Man to death! "
And after Ye Xuan snatched that top-grade mineral vein, he did not choose to let it go!
It had to be said that more than thirty supreme-grade mineral veins had collapsed!
In a short while, Ye Xuan had stolen another ore vein. At this moment, Bai Dizi could not sit still!
Bai Dizi looked at White Robe and the others who were still fighting and shouted, "Stop!"
Stop!
As soon as these words were spoken, all the experts in the surroundings stopped moving!
Everyone looked at Bai Dizi. Bai Dizi said gravely, "White Robe, can you kill Luo Hou and the others today?"
Kill Luo Hou and the others?
White Robe shook his head.
While they had the upper hand, it was still not enough to completely kill Luo Hou and the others!
If Luo Hou and the others were so easy to kill, Daoting would not have waited until now!
Bai Dizi looked at White Robe. "If you continue to fight, then Ye Xuan will steal all the ore veins!"
White Robe frowned.
He had not expected that Ye Xuan would run over to steal ore veins instead of fighting!
This person never played his cards according to common sense!
Bai Dizi suddenly said, "Let's go!"
With that, he turned around and left.
At this moment, Qing Yaoyao stood in front of him!
Bai Dizi looked at Qing Yaoyao. "Do you want to perish together now?"
The corners of Qing Yaoyao's mouth curled up. "Why not?"
Bai Dizi turned to look at Luo Hou. "If we fight to the death now, no one in your Dao Tomb can suppress White Robe!
We will all die, but White Robe will not!
Once Luo Hou and the others are gone, I guarantee you that White Robe will flatten everyone in your Dao Tomb!
So, if we fight now, we will perish together!
Luo Hou, do you want to perish together? "
The Dao Tomb and Daoting had fought for so many years, but they had never truly fought to the death!
Because both sides were about the same in strength, fighting to the death would mean perishing together!
Obviously, they did not want to perish together!
They were all developing!
They hoped that a super genius would appear on their side!
A super genius that could change the outcome of the battle!
White Robe was also very strong, but not enough!
But now, one had appeared. Unfortunately, this person was not from the Dao Court, nor was he from the Burial Mound of Dao. However, Ye Xuan was now on the side of the Burial Mound of Dao!
So, Daoting was in a very bad situation!
After a moment of silence, Luo Hou looked at Qing Yaoyao and shook his head.
Obviously, he did not want to perish together with Daoting!
If Ye Xuan was a genius from the Dao Tomb, then the Dao Tomb would do everything in their power to protect Ye Xuan's growth. Unfortunately, Ye Xuan was not!
They could only cooperate with Ye Xuan.
Bai Dizi and the others turned and left!
After Bai Dizi and the others left, Qing Yaoyao said softly, "They will not give up!"
Luo Hou looked at Qing Yaoyao. "Do you believe Ye Xuan's words?"
Qing Yaoyao smiled. "Whirling World?"
Luo Hou nodded.
Chi Yaoyao was the smartest person among the Four Great Kings, or rather, the smartest person in the Dao Tomb!
That was why she could lead the experts of the Dao Tomb to fight against White Robe!
If it was someone else, the Heaven Realm Abyss would have been Daoting long ago!
After a moment of silence, Qing Yaoyao said, "I believe him!"
Luo Hou looked at Chi Yaoyao and said nothing.
Qing Yaoyao smiled. "Luo Hou, we can't find out the origin of that sword and the person behind it, nor can we explain it!
But now, there are three places that we can't step into. The first is the Milky Way Realm, the second is the Whirling World, and the third is the legendary Ancient God Abyss! "
Saying this, she looked into the distance. "He can't be from the Ancient God Abyss, so there is only one explanation. He is either from the Whirling World or the Milky Way Realm!
And he has the Qiankun Gourd … Do you understand what I mean? "
Luo Hou nodded. He turned to the people behind him. "From now on, these Dao Breakers will listen to your orders!"
Saying this, he turned and left.
Chi Yaoyao suddenly said, "Not enough!"
Luo Hou stopped. After a moment of silence, he said, "I will arrange it!"
Saying this, he disappeared into the distance with Bitter King.
Qing Yaoyao slowly closed her eyes. After a moment, she shook her head and smiled. "You really know how to fool people!"
Saying this, she turned and left!
...
When Daoting chose to retreat, Ye Xuan also immediately retreated!
After returning to the Heavenly King City, Ye Xuan's face was full of smiles.
He had obtained a total of four top quality mineral veins!
Four!
One of them was a top-grade mine, and it was the largest mine in the Dao Court!
Four top quality mineral veins were enough to completely change the fate of the Fifth Dimension!
At this time, Qing Yaoyao walked into the hall.
Ye Xuan looked at Qing Yaoyao. She smiled. "Congratulations on obtaining four top quality spiritual veins!"
Ye Xuan was silent.
He knew that this woman in front of him was not easy to fool!
Qing Yaoyao sat to the side and said, "I now represent the Dao Tomb to discuss our cooperation!"
Ye Xuan smiled. "Miss Yaoyao, please speak!"
Qing Yaoyao looked at Ye Xuan. "Twenty top quality mineral veins!
Within two years, you have to give the Dao Tomb 20 top quality spiritual veins! "
Ye Xuan was silent.
Two years!
Qing Yaoyao continued, "In addition, if you collect the Dao Scripture in the future, you have to share it with us!"
Ye Xuan still did not speak.
Qing Yaoyao raised her teacup and took a sip. "Also, we want to meet someone!"
Ye Xuan asked, "Who?"
Qing Yaoyao looked at Ye Xuan. "It would be best if it is a woman in a plain dress!"
Ye Xuan shook his head.
Chi Yaoyao said, "Your sister has a powerful soul within her. This powerful soul forced the Dao Ancestor back with one punch. We can meet her!"
Ye Xuan thought for a moment. "I will think of a way!"
Qing Yaoyao looked at Ye Xuan. "Not think of a way, but we must meet her!
If we don't see the person behind you, we won't believe that you're some bullshit Young Sect Master of the Whirling Sect! "
Ye Xuan looked at Qing Yaoyao. "Miss Yaoyao, do you believe me?"
Qing Yaoyao smiled. "It doesn't matter if I believe you or not. Because I'm not the boss of the Dao Tomb. Understand?"
Ye Xuan nodded. "I understand!"
Qing Yaoyao put down her teacup and said, "We know that you have someone behind you. However, we've never come into contact with you!
So, we don't believe you!
It's very simple to dispel our doubts. We just have to meet the person behind you with our own eyes. Any one of them will do. Of course, they have to be strong! "
Ye Xuan nodded. "I will!"
Qing Yaoyao looked at Ye Xuan. "We will protect you during these two years. Even if the Dao Ancestor appears, we will!
However, you have to bring us benefits during this period. "
Ye Xuan fell silent.
Qing Yaoyao stood up and walked over to the entrance of the hall. She looked up into the sky. "During this period, you can use the resources of the Dao Tomb. However, you can't attain the Dao Control Realm!
Because if you dare to charge into the Dao Control Realm, then the Daoting Realm will definitely fight you to the death, and they'll do it even if they have to take us down with them!
You're at the Dao Verification Realm, and you're at the Dao Control Realm. So, in order to prevent the situation you're in and the Dao Tomb from becoming even more difficult, don't charge into the Dao Control Realm for now. "
Ye Xuan remained silent.
Chi Yaoyao continued. "If you're able to gather all eight scriptures in the future, then the Dao Tomb will offer the last one to you.
Of course, the precondition is that you're really the Young Sect Master of the Whirling World! "
As she spoke, she turned around to look at Ye Xuan. "I'm done!
It's your turn now! "
Ye Xuan fell silent for a moment before he said, "I want to take a look at the Dao Scripture in the Dao Tomb!"
Qing Yaoyao shook her head. "No!
We'll give it to you once you've gathered all eight scriptures. Not now. "
Ye Xuan hurriedly said, "I'll just take a look. I won't take it away!"
Chi Yaoyao still shook her head.
Ye Xuan ran over to Qing Yaoyao and hugged her arm. He begged, "Just one look!
One look is enough! "
Looking at Ye Xuan, Ting Yaoyao said, "It's meaningless for you to look at it."
Ye Xuan said seriously, "I have a brother called the Ninth Floor. He's at the end of his lifespan, and he'll die in a few days. His last wish is to take a look at that Dao Scripture …"
The Ninth Floor: "…"
....
PS: Tickets are just fleeting clouds.
I've already seen through it. Have you?
If you have, then vote for it!
It's useless to keep it!









Chapter 1382
Inside the hall, Qian Yaoyao looked at Ye Xuan with a silent smile.
Ye Xuan blushed with shame.
This woman wasn't easy to fool!
At this moment, Qian Yaoyao suddenly said, "Tell me, why do you want to see that scripture?"
Ye Xuan said solemnly, "To improve!"
Qian Yaoyao looked at Ye Xuan, "That scripture won't be of much use to you."
Ye Xuan was puzzled, "Why?"
Qian Yaoyao smiled, "Because it's too profound, you won't understand it now!"
Just as Ye Xuan was about to speak, Qian Yaoyao continued, "The later scriptures are more profound than the previous ones!
As far as I know, the fifth scripture in your hand is enough for one to reach the Dao Manipulation Realm, but after that is Dao Attainment!
Do you know how many Dao Attainment experts there are in this world? "
Ye Xuan shook his head, "I don't know!"
Chi Yaoyao said, "There are only two people in the Dao Tomb and two people in the Daoting Realm!
What you see now, be it White Robe or Zhen Wu, are only at the Dao Manipulation Realm. Luo Hou and I are the same! "
Ye Xuan said solemnly, "Miss Yaoyao, there are strong and weak in the Dao Manipulation Realm, right?"
Qian Yaoyao nodded, "Of course!
The Dao Manipulation Realm is divided into three levels, the initial realm, the Ascendant realm, and the Defense realm.
Luo Hou, White Robe, and I are all at the Defense realm, the true Dao Manipulation Realm!
There are also strong and weak in the Defense realm, but it depends on one's combat ability. "
Ye Xuan said solemnly, "Dao Ancestors are Dao Attainment?"
Qian Yaoyao nodded, "Yes!
So is the Lord of the Dao Tomb! "
Ye Xuan was silent.
Qian Yaoyao continued, "The scripture in the Dao Tomb can help one achieve Dao Attainment, but do you really think you can achieve Dao Attainment just by looking at a scripture?
If it was really that simple, then the Dao Tomb and the Daoting World would already be filled with Daoists!
If you want to achieve the Dao, you must first reach the peak of the Dao Defense Realm, which is the Defense Realm. Moreover, this is only the foundation. If you want to go further, it will depend on your own state of mind and understanding of the Dao! "
Ye Xuan said solemnly, "Can you elaborate?"
Qian Yaoyao smiled and said, "The three thousand great daos all have their own dao. If you want to achieve dao, you need something of your own.
For example, the Reincarnation Great Dao that you obtained. If you want to achieve Dao, you have to create something similar. Do you understand? "
Ye Xuan nodded. "Understood!"
Qian Yaoyao said softly, "Achieving the Dao is easier said than done!
Since ancient times, there have been very few who have attained the Dao. "
Ye Xuan suddenly said, "I still want to see!"
He didn't want to use the Dao Scripture to achieve Dao, but he wanted to learn the Dao Scripture martial arts in the Dao Scripture!
His Dao Sword could be said to be a threat to an expert of Qian Yaoyao's level.
And he had heard from Destiny Knowing that the Dao Scripture martial arts in the later stages were more powerful!
After hearing Ye Xuan's words, Qian Yaoyao was silent for a moment, then said, "You really want to see it?"
Ye Xuan nodded. "Can you help me?"
Qian Yaoyao's status in the Dao Tomb was not low. He knew that if this woman was willing to help, then there was a chance.
Chi Yaoyao suddenly grabbed Ye Xuan's shoulder. In the next moment, she and Ye Xuan disappeared from the main hall.
When they reappeared, they were already in front of Luo Hou.
Luo Hou looked at the two of them. "What's the matter?"
Qian Yaoyao smiled. "He wants to see our Dao Scripture!"
Luo Hou immediately shook his head.
At this time, Ye Xuan took out a storage ring and handed it to Luo Hou. Luo Hou glanced at the ring and saw two supreme-grade spirit veins inside.
Luo Hou was silent.
He was a little tempted, but he was hesitant.
Chi Yaoyao suddenly smiled. "What? Are you afraid that he'll attain the Dao?"
Luo Hou immediately put the storage ring away and said, "We can only look!"
Ye Xuan nodded. "Alright!"
Luo Hou opened his palm, and an ancient scroll appeared in his hand.
The Dao Scripture!
Ye Xuan took the scroll and opened it. Two words entered his eyes: Attain the Dao.
The sixth scroll: Attain the Dao!
Ye Xuan opened the Dao Scripture and looked at the first line. "The highest virtue is like water. Water benefits all things but does not compete …"
Luo Hou and Qian Yaoyao were both looking at Ye Xuan.
Luo Hou was very curious about why Ye Xuan wanted to look at the Dao Scripture.
Could it be that he wanted to attain the Dao?
That was absolutely impossible!
If Ye Xuan attained the Dao just by looking at the Dao Scripture, then that would be too abnormal!
If it wasn't for the sake of attaining the Dao, then what was it for?
He was very curious because Ye Xuan had spent two supreme-grade spirit veins for it!
Actually, Qian Yaoyao was very curious as well.
Spending two supreme-grade spirit veins just to take a look at the Dao Scripture was definitely worth it for others, but it was definitely not worth it for Ye Xuan.
Because Ye Xuan's accomplishments weren't really related to the Dao Scripture. Moreover, there wasn't much meaning for Ye Xuan to look at the Dao Scripture right now!
Right at this moment, Ye Xuan suddenly put the Dao Scripture away and returned it to Luo Hou.
Luo Hou gazed at Ye Xuan. "Did you gain anything?"
Ye Xuan smiled bitterly. "Senior, I don't understand it at all. I regret my decision!
Just return the spirit veins to me! "
Luo Hou's expression froze. Is that even something a human can say?
Chi Yaoyao shook her head repeatedly as well. He's truly shameless!
Luo Hou put the Dao Scripture away and left.
He had nothing to say to a shameless person!
Ye Xuan was a little helpless. He looked at Qian Yaoyao. "I really regret it!"
Chi Yaoyao gave Ye Xuan a deep look. "No matter what you got, congratulations!"
With that, she turned and left.
Ye Xuan was silent where he was.
This woman was extraordinarily shrewd!
Ye Xuan turned and left.
As he turned, the corners of his mouth curled up slightly.
...
Divine Palace.
At this moment, Bai Dizi, True Martial Divine Lord, and White Robe were all present.
The atmosphere in the hall was heavy and somewhat depressing.
This time, not only did they fail to kill Ye Xuan, but Ye Xuan also stole four supreme-grade spirit veins!
Four supreme-grade spirit veins. Although it wasn't a serious loss, it wasn't a small one!
Moreover, Ye Xuan stole the biggest one!
At this moment, True Martial suddenly said, "Is he really from the Whirling World?"
Whirling World!
Hearing this, White Robe frowned slightly. He looked at Bai Dizi. Bai Dizi said in a deep voice, "It's possible!"
True Martial said, "How so?"
Bai Dizi said softly, "We can't find out the force behind him, including the woman in plain dress and the origin of his bloodline.
If he really is from the Whirling World, then everything makes sense!
But … "
At this point, a cold light flashed in his eyes. "He is definitely not from the Whirling World!"
True Martial asked, "Why do you think so?"
Bai Dizi said, "If he really is from the Whirling World and it is as strong as he said, then the Fifth Dimension Tendo wouldn't have fallen!
Moreover, he could have asked the Whirling World to help him restore the Fifth Dimension!
Not only that, he could have asked the Whirling World's powerhouses to destroy me and Daoting, but he didn't do so?
Because of what?
Because of training?
Nonsense!
He said he was the Young Sect Master of the Whirling Sect. Obviously, he wanted to trick Luo Hou and make Luo Hou stand on his side!
Obviously, he succeeded in duping them! "
At this time, True Martial suddenly said, "If he is not from the Whirling World, then where is he from?"
Bai Dizi shook his head. "I can't find anything!"
As for the origin of Ye Xuan's bloodline, he still couldn't find anything.
Who is this Ye Xuan's bloodline?
At this time, White Robe suddenly said, "The two of you are always overcautious and never dare to be decisive.
Let me tell you, if this person reaches the Imperial Dao, he will become extremely difficult to kill.
At that time, the price I will have to pay for Daoting will be at least ten times greater than now! "
After saying this, he got up and left.
The hall suddenly fell into silence.
...
Ye Xuan returned to the Fifth Dimension. After returning to the Fifth Dimension, he immediately took out the two top-grade mineral veins!
With these two top-grade mineral veins, there would be more and more Dao Validation powerhouses in the Fifth Dimension.
In addition, he also distributed the fortune divine crystals he obtained from the Divine Palace to An Lanxiu and the others.
This was because An Lanxiu, Aro, and the others would be the easiest to reach Dao Validation!
Once they reached Dao Validation, with their battle strength, they could even kill Imperial Dao powerhouses!
Currently, there were more and more Self Release powerhouses in the Fifth Dimension, but Dao Validation powerhouses were still too few. However, with the fortune divine crystals and top-grade mineral veins, Ye Xuan believed that in the near future, there would be more and more powerhouses in the Fifth Dimension.
What was worth mentioning was that there were many spirits in the Fifth Dimension!
These spirits were all brought over by Ye Xuan and Guan Yin from various worlds!
If the Fifth Dimension wanted to completely recover, it needed these spirits. The existence of these spirits would make the Spiritual Qi in the Fifth Dimension more and more!
In order to invite these spirits to the Fifth Dimension, Ye Xuan put in a lot of effort. Not only did he let Xiao Ling'er personally swindle them, as long as these spirits came to the Fifth Dimension, he would give them purple qi. Although his purple qi was not as pure as the little white guy's, it was still a great help to these spirits.
In addition, after these spirits came to the Fifth Dimension, their status was also very high.
In the entire Fifth Dimension, no one dared to harm these spirits. It could be said that these spirits could do whatever they wanted in the Fifth Dimension.
Fortunately, these spirits were naturally kind and would not act recklessly.
In short, with the purple qi and Xiao Ling'er's swindle, there would be spirits coming to the Fifth Dimension almost every day …
...
In the room, Ye Xuan sat cross-legged on the ground, his eyes slowly closed.
Dao scripture martial arts!
The Dao scripture in the Dao Tomb also contained a Dao scripture martial arts, and he and Ye Zhiming had already obtained that Dao scripture martial arts!
Dao scripture body refinement!
The Dao scripture martial arts in the Dao scripture in the Dao Tomb was a body refinement technique!
To Ye Xuan, this was really timely help!
This was because what he wanted to improve the most was his physical body. His current physical body could fight against the Dao Proving Realm, but it would be a little difficult to fight against the Dao Defending Realm!
He did not dare to take the damage of the Dao Defending Realm head on!
To put it simply, his current physical body was already somewhat insufficient!
To him, this Daoist Canon was like coal in a snowy day!
As if thinking of something, Ye Xuan asked, "Zhiming, how strong is this Dao scripture body refinement?"
He could not understand the Dao scripture, but Ye Zhiming could!
After a moment of silence, Ye Zhiming said, "If you successfully cultivate it, your physical body will become a Dao body … This is a body refinement technique with no limit, you can continue to grow …"
Ye Xuan was stunned, then asked, "What do you mean?"
Ye Zhiming said, "It means that once your physical body becomes a Dao body, you can continue to grow, you can reach the Dao Defending Realm, you can achieve Dao, and even beyond … This Dao body is the first body refinement technique in the Dao scripture."
As she spoke, she paused, then said, "There is no other!"
.....
Peak









Chapter 1383
The Dao Physique!
After that, Ye Zhiming continued to explain the Dao Physique to Ye Xuan.
What was the Dao Physique?
It was the Grand Dao Physique!
The Dao Scripture was the origin of all martial civilizations. It could be said that the universe could be divided into two types of martial civilizations. One was the Dao Scripture Martial Dao Civilization, and the other wasn't.
As for the Dao Scripture's Body Tempering Technique, it was number one in the 3,000 Great Daos, without a doubt!
Once he attained the Dao Physique, then his body could attain the Dao, control the Dao, attain the Dao ….
At that time, his body would even be stronger than his Sword Dao!
Ye Xuan started to cultivate the Dao Physique under Ye Zhiming's guidance!
...
Heaven Abyss.
Luo Hou, Bitter King, Chi Yaoyao, and Zhan Man were all present within the hall of the Dao Tomb City. Besides them, there was another person, Zhan Man!
He was one of the four kings!
Three of the four kings of the Dao Tomb were already here!
Luo Hou gazed at Kun Yaoyao, "Kun King, what do you think the Dao Tomb will do next?"
Kun Yaoyao fell silent for a moment before she said, "They won't give up!
Think about it. What would we do if we were in their shoes?
It's very simple, we would stop at nothing to eliminate Ye Xuan!
So, I think they'll act as soon as the Dao Ancestor emerges from his closed door cultivation! "
The Dao Ancestor!
Everyone's expressions became slightly solemn when they heard this.
After all, he was one of the supreme experts in the world!
In the entire Dao Tomb, only the Overlord could contend against this person. However, the Overlord was still in closed-door cultivation!
It could be said that the Dao Tomb would be in an even more difficult situation once the Dao Ancestor emerged from his closed door cultivation!
Meanwhile, Bitter King suddenly said, "What about the person standing behind Ye Xuan?"
All of them gazed at Bitter King, and he spoke solemnly, "There's someone standing behind Ye Xuan, but they've only acted at the critical moment. Don't all of you think that this is a little unusual?"
Luo Hou said, "Just be frank!"
Bitter King spoke softly, "Have all of you noticed that the person behind him seems to be training Ye Xuan!?"
Training Ye Xuan!?
Luo Hou was silent.
Bitter King continued, "This person is definitely not simple. His life is like cheating!
This kind of person's background is definitely not simple, especially his bloodline. Even the Goddess' Devouring Bloodline is far inferior to the power of his bloodline. Neither the Daoting World nor the Dao Tomb can find the origin of his bloodline!
This means that even if the force behind him is not as powerful as the Saha World, it is definitely not simple! "
As he spoke, he looked towards Huan Yaoyao. "Yao Monarch, what do you think?"
Qing Yaoyao smiled and said, "Ah Ku, you're right. It doesn't matter if the person behind him is the Whirling World's Whirling Sect or not. What's important is that the force behind him is powerful. That's enough!"
As she spoke, she glanced at the crowd. "Everyone, can we reconcile with the Daoting?"
Everyone fell silent.
Could the Land of the Dao Tomb and the Daoting be reconciled?
Obviously not!
Chi Yaoyao continued, "There's no way we can reconcile with the Daoting!
Even if we want to develop peacefully, the Daoting won't allow it!
Bai Dizi and his people have always wanted to restore the order of the past, and we are the biggest obstacle in their way.
If this continues, the Land of the Dao Tomb will not be able to defeat them!
Therefore, in my opinion, the Land of the Dao Tomb and the Daoting will have to fight sooner or later. Since there will be a fight sooner or later, why don't we ally with Ye Xuan? "
Ah Ku said solemnly, "If we join forces with Ye Xuan to destroy the Daoting, then Ye Xuan …"
Huan Yaoyao looked towards Ah Ku. "Are you trying to say that Ye Xuan will replace the Daoting as our greatest enemy?"
Ah Ku nodded.
Huan Yaoyao smiled and said, "Why would you think that?
Ah Ku, do you know?
If Ye Xuan is willing to let go of his hatred and surrender to the Daoting, the Daoting will definitely accept him! "
Ah Ku was silent.
Chi Yaoyao said again, "Who is our greatest threat now?
It's the Daoting, not Ye Xuan!
There is no conflict of interest between us and Ye Xuan, nor is there any enmity.
So, why should we choose to be enemies with him?
We can ally with him and destroy the Daoting together!
Also, have any of you thought about how strong the force behind Ye Xuan is?
Let's not talk about others, let's talk about this Fifth Dimension Tendo.
She hasn't revealed her strength, but have any of you thought that there could be such a powerful person in this world? "
Everyone was silent.
Mu Niannian!
This woman's strength far exceeded everyone's expectations!
She destroyed a Dao Ancestor's body with only 30% of her strength. How terrifying was her strength?
Huan Yaoyao continued, "Also, the power of Ye Xuan's bloodline must be beyond everyone's expectations!
Why don't you all think about the source of this bloodline power?
And those two swords on him, just how powerful are the masters of those two swords? "
Everyone was silent.
Huan Yaoyao smiled, "So, it doesn't matter if he's the Young Sect Master of the Whirling Sect. What's important is that the force behind him is strong enough!
Just as Ah Ku said, although this force doesn't show itself often, haven't you all noticed?
Whenever Ye Xuan is in danger of death, there will always be someone to help him! "
Luo Hou looked at Huan Yaoyao, "Is the force behind him really training him?"
Huan Yaoyao chuckled, "Who knows?
Maybe they're letting him go, or maybe they can't care about him for now … In any case, it's fine as long as there's someone behind him!
Also, don't forget about Ye Xuan himself!
If he reaches the Dao Controlling Realm, none of us here will be able to kill him. "
Beside her, Zhan Man frowned, "Is it that exaggerated?"
"Yes!"
It wasn't Zhan Man who spoke, but Luo Hou.
Zhan Man gazed at Luo Hou, and Luo Hou spoke softly, "Once he attains the Dao Controlling Realm, then it won't be impossible for any one of us here to kill him, but it will be extremely difficult!
His Sword Dao and bloodline power can't be underestimated. "
Meanwhile, Chi Yaoyao continued, "Actually, the more monstrous he is, the better it is for us!
As for whether he'll become a threat to us in the future, do you think he's more reliable or Daoting? "
All of them fell silent.
Compared to Daoting, they were more willing to choose Ye Xuan.
Besides being shameless, Ye Xuan's character wasn't bad at all.
At the very least, they'd never heard of Ye Xuan doing anything immoral or going back on his word.
Huan Yaoyao stood up, "Let's discuss how we should deal with the Dao Ancestor who's about to come out of his closed door cultivation!"
Dao Ancestor!
The expressions of everyone here gradually became solemn.
....
In the Fifth Dimension.
Ye Xuan had been in closed door cultivation all this time!
Cultivating the Dao Physique!
The Dao Scripture contained the detailed cultivation method of the Dao Physique. Coupled with Ye Zhiming's explanation, Ye Xuan's cultivation went smoothly!
It could be said that the more Ye Xuan cultivated, the more excited he became!
Because he discovered the strength of this Dao Physique!
Dao Physique!
The Dao Scripture Body Tempering Technique was truly terrifying. It was at least several times more terrifying than the Dao Fist Technique!
Now he was even more looking forward to the Dao Scripture martial arts!
...
In a certain courtyard, a petite girl sat cross-legged on the ground. Around her, a powerful sword intent was emanating!
This person was Xiao Qi!
Xiao Qi had been in closed door cultivation all this time.
After an unknown period of time, Xiao Qi suddenly opened her eyes. In the next moment, the sound of a sword suddenly soared into the sky from the courtyard. At the same time, a powerful aura suddenly shook around Xiao Qi. In an instant, the courtyard she was in turned into dust!
Breakthrough!
Dao Validation!
At this moment, Guan Yin suddenly appeared in the field. Looking at Xiao Qi in the distance, Guan Yin's eyes were filled with excitement.
Xiao Qi had broken through!
Xiao Qi, An Lanxiu, and the others were the focus of cultivation. It could be said that the fortune crystals that Ye Xuan brought back were given to the few with the best talent. There was no other way. The current Fifth Dimension did not have the ability to cultivate everyone to Dao Validation. They could only choose a few especially outstanding people!
Xiao Qi opened her palm, and a sword appeared in her hand. She looked up at the horizon, and there was a trace of a strange color in her eyes.
Guan Yin walked in front of Xiao Qi. "Xiao Qi, are you okay?"
Xiao Qi slowly closed her eyes. After a long silence, she chuckled. "I am still me!"
Guan Yin was puzzled by what he heard!
Xiao Qi suddenly opened her eyes and looked at Guan Yin. "Where is he?"
Guan Yin asked, "Ye Xuan?"
Xiao Qi nodded.
Guan Yin said, "He has been in closed door cultivation ever since he came back!"
Xiao Qi nodded slightly. "I need to go somewhere. If he is in trouble, contact me!"
After saying that, she turned around and left with her sword.
Guan Yin hurriedly asked, "Where are you going?"
Xiao Qi stopped and said softly, "Third dimension!"
After saying that, she turned into a sword light and disappeared into the horizon.
Third dimension?
Guan Yin furrowed his brows.
A moment later, Guan Yin turned around and left.
No matter what, for the Fifth Dimension, Xiao Qi's breakthrough was a good thing!
Xiao Qi had already broken through, so An Lanxiu and the others were definitely not far away!
These people were not any less talented than Xiao Qi. Of course, Xiao Qi was a little special.
Guan Yin arrived in front of Ye Xuan's room. After Ye Xuan returned, he had been in closed door cultivation for several days. During these days, Ye Xuan did not contact the outside world. Therefore, she did not know what Ye Xuan was doing.
As if thinking of something, Guan Yin sighed.
It could be said that if there was no Ye Xuan, there would be no Fifth Dimension!
The current Fifth Dimension was not any worse than other places. The experts of the Fifth Dimension were not willing to leave. Not only that, some experts from the Dao World and the Sixth Dimension had taken the initiative to come to the Fifth Dimension!
Here, there were Dao scriptures and cultivation resources!
Who was not willing to come?
Moreover, the current Fifth Dimension was very united, unprecedentedly united!
She knew that all of this was because of Ye Xuan. If something happened to Ye Xuan, then the entire Fifth Dimension would instantly change!
The human heart was something that could not be understood!
She and Ye Xuan could no longer change the thoughts of this generation. However, they could change the next generation and let them truly love this universe!
This was Ye Xuan's true goal!
He wanted everyone to recognize the Fifth Dimension and treat it as their home!
After a moment, Guan Yin turned around and left.
....
Somewhere in the starry sky, Mu Niannian was quietly lying in the starry sky. The surroundings were silent.
Around him, more and more strange energy gathered towards Mu Niannian's body …
....
PS: More and more monthly votes are gathering towards Green Phoenix …
Apex









Chapter 1384
Half a month later, Ye Xuan finally walked out of the room.
Outside the room, Ye Xuan looked up at the sky. He closed his eyes and spread his arms. His body became illusory. At this moment, his body seemed to be one with heaven and earth.
Dao Body!
After half a month, under Ye Zhiming's guidance, he finally succeeded in cultivating this Dao Body!
The reason why it was so fast was that his physical body had a strong foundation!
Before his physical body reached Dao Body, his physical body was already top-notch!
Now that his physical body had become a Daoist Body, even the Gourd Deity could not melt him!
It could be said that among the Dao Defense Realm, only White Robe and Zhen Wu could pose a threat to his physical body.
However, if they wanted to kill him, it would not be as easy as before!
Now, he could completely rely on his invincible physical body to fight against Zhen Wu and White Robe!
In short, he was more tanned and harder to die!
In addition, this Dao Scripture could also be improved. His physical body could reach Dao Defense Realm, Dao Attainment Realm …
Within the scope of Dao Scripture martial arts, there was no upper limit for Dao Scripture Body Tempering!
This was a Dao Scripture Body Tempering that could continue to grow!
At this moment, Guan Yin appeared beside Ye Xuan. She looked at Ye Xuan and asked, "You broke through?"
Ye Xuan nodded.
Guan Yin smiled sweetly, "Congratulations!"
The improvement of Ye Xuan's strength was beneficial to the entire Fifth Dimension!
Ye Xuan looked at Guan Yin, "How is the Fifth Dimension now?"
Guan Yin's lips curled up, "We have more than three thousand spirits. These spirits are now living in our Fifth Dimension for a long time."
Ye Xuan nodded, "You must give them preferential treatment!"
The help these three thousand spirits could provide to the Fifth Dimension was immeasurable.
Guan Yin nodded, "Very preferential treatment. Also, Xiao Ling'er has become the boss of these spirits!"
Ye Xuan blinked. "I became the boss?"
Ever since the recruitment of the Spirits of Heaven and Earth began, Ye Xuan had given Xiao Ling'er full authority to entertain these spirits. This was because it was easier for Xiao Ling'er to gain the trust of these spirits.
Normally, Heaven and Earth Spirits would not believe in humans!
Little did he expect that Xiao Ling'er would become the boss!
Guan Yin laughed and said: "Yes, she is already the boss of all the spirits. Moreover, she also created a sect called the Spirit Sect. Inside are all the spirits of Heaven and Earth and she is the sect master!"
Ye Xuan hurriedly said, "Come, let's go take a look at the Spirit Sect!"
Guan Yin smiled. "Alright!"
Very quickly, the two of them arrived at the Spirit Sect!
The Spirit Sect was built in the depths of a large mountain. As soon as the two of them entered the mountain, Ye Xuan sensed an incomparably pure spiritual energy!
The Spiritual Qi here was too rich!
It was in no way inferior to the Dao Tomb!
Ye Xuan was a little surprised.
At this time, Guan Yin suddenly said: "Because there are many Spirits of Heaven and Earth here, I placed six top-grade Dragon Veins here. In addition to the Spirits of Heaven and Earth themselves, the Spiritual Qi here is at least ten times richer than in other places!"
She paused for a moment, then continued: "There is no other way. When these spirits come to our Fifth Dimension, we have to give them the best conditions.
Moreover, it is very worth it. After these spirits come, they will help us restore the imbalance of the Spiritual Qi in certain places. "
Ye Xuan laughed. "These Spirits of Heaven and Earth are generally very kind. If we treat them sincerely, they will also follow us sincerely!"
Guan Yin nodded. She had come into contact with these Spirits of Heaven and Earth before. They were indeed kind and easy to get along with.
Not long after, the two of them arrived at the Spirit Sect. It had to be said that the Spirit Sect was built quite well. There were more than ten halls, and they were all very large. At first glance, it looked very imposing!
At this time, a ball of white light suddenly appeared in front of Ye Xuan and Guan Yin. In the white light, there was a pair of eyes. When she saw Ye Xuan, her eyes immediately became alert.
Vigilance immediately appeared in her eyes, but when she saw Guan Yin, the vigilance in her eyes turned into joy.
The ball of white light floated in front of Guan Yin and said in a crisp voice: "Sister Guan Yin!"
Guan Yin smiled slightly. "It's Xiaoxing!"
The white light hurriedly nodded. "It's me!"
Guan Yin laughed. "Where is your Sect Master?"
Xiaoxing turned her head to take a look, then said: "Sect Master is in a meeting!"
Meeting!
Hearing this, Ye Xuan's expression became a little strange!
This Xiao Ling 'er is in a meeting?
Guan Yin blinked. "Can you take us to have a look?"
Xiaoxing nodded. "Yes!"
As she spoke, she seemed to have thought of something and suddenly looked at Ye Xuan. "He …"
Guan Yin laughed. "He is your Sect Master's elder brother!"
Elder brother!
Xiaoxing blinked. "Elder brother?"
Ye Xuan nodded and said with a smile, "Yes!"
Xiaoxing glanced at Ye Xuan, her eyes full of curiosity. "Sect Master said that you are very powerful. Are you really that powerful?"
Ye Xuan laughed and then spread out his palm. Dozens of wisps of purple gas floated toward Xiaoxing. When she saw the purple gas, Xiaoxing suddenly became excited. She looked at Ye Xuan and said with a trembling voice: "Is it for me?"
Ye Xuan nodded and said with a smile: "Yes!"
Xiaoxing hurriedly said: "Oh, thank you, thank you!"
Very excited, very excited!
The purple gas was really useful to them. If the purple gas was a little purer, it would be enough to change the fate of these spirits!
After a while, Xiaoxing brought Ye Xuan and Guan Yin to the main hall of the Spirit Palace. At this time, there were more than 3,000 spirits gathered on the bluestone square below the main hall!
When he saw more than 3,000 spirits, Ye Xuan was a little shocked!
When these spirits gathered together, it was really too shocking!
He had never seen so many spirits!
At this moment, the spiritual energy on the bluestone square was so rich that even the 33 levels of Daoting could not compare to it!
In the past, these spirits were equivalent to rogue cultivators, and they lived in fear. Because of their own reasons, many humans had always wanted to obtain them. Therefore, most of the spirits of heaven and earth hid in the mountains and forests.
Now, Ye Xuan gathered them together!
Not only did he protect them, but he also gave them the best resources and status!
Here, humans were very respectful when they saw them. No one dared to be disrespectful to them.
Moreover, everyone's respect for them came from the bottom of their hearts because they had indeed helped the Fifth Dimension a lot!
They didn't do anything, they were just helping!
In the distance, Xiao Ling'er was wearing a white dress and holding a staff in her hand. She looked at the spirits below with a calm expression, very much like a big sister!
Below, all the spirits were looking at Xiao Ling'er. They were also very convinced of Xiao Ling'er.
This was because Xiao Ling'er was the highest-ranked among them!
In addition, Xiao Ling'er's status in the Fifth Dimension was unparalleled. Who didn't know that Ye Xuan treated her like a younger sister?
Most importantly, Xiao Ling'er had a good relationship with the little white fellow!
Who was that little guy?
The Spirit Ancestor!
The Spirit Ancestor of Heaven and Earth!
In the distance, Xiao Ling'er suddenly pressed her hand down lightly, and the surroundings instantly fell silent!
Very imposing!
Xiao Ling 'er glanced at the spirits here and said, "All of you have to get even more companions!
Here, there is food to eat, a place to live, and there are people to protect everyone. Anyone who finds a companion, I will give them a hundred strands of violet energy!
Plus thirty Fortune Divine Crystals! "
With that, she waved her right hand, and a large pile of Fortune Divine Crystals appeared in front of her.
There were more than a thousand Fortune Divine Crystals!
She got it from Ye Xuan.
She'd asked for it!
Ye Xuan had given her 10,000 Fortune Divine Crystals, and he hadn't asked her why she wanted them. In any case, he'd given them to her if she wanted them!
However, Ye Xuan hadn't expected that Xiao Ling'er would use them for this!
The eyes of many spirits here instantly lit up when they saw the Fortune Divine Crystals!
Fortune Divine Crystals!
They were very useful to them as well. Because they contained extremely pure energy within them, and it would be extremely beneficial to them if they absorbed it.
Little Ling 'er continued, "Call a little friend over, thirty creation divine crystals. If you call two over, seventy. If you call three over, one hundred and fifty. If you call more than five over, directly give three hundred creation divine crystals and three hundred wisps of purple aura!
As for the companions all of you call over, they will get Fortune Divine Crystals and violet energy as well. "
All the spirits below instantly became excited when they heard this!
300 Fortune Divine Crystals and 300 strands of violet energy!
This was a good thing!
Many of them were dumbfounded!
They were actually very poor when they were independent cultivators, so they'd never even seen Fortune Divine Crystals and violet energy before this!
Meanwhile, Xiao Ling'er distributed the Fortune Divine Crystals and violet energy to some of the spirits. All of them were from the companions she'd called over earlier!
Some of the spirits here were extremely envious when they saw those spirits obtain the Fortune Divine Crystals and violet energy!
Meanwhile, Xiao Ling'er continued, "Everyone has a chance!
So long as you call your companions over, you'll have it.
Now, go call them over!
Don't worry, I'll send people to protect all of you. "
It didn't take long for the spirits here to shoot into the sky.
They were going to look for companions!
Even if humans did find companions, those spirits would be extremely vigilant because they didn't trust humans at all!
However, it wouldn't be a problem if the spirits went to look for other spirits!
The relationship between spirits wasn't as complicated as it was for humans. So, making the spirits look for other spirits could attract even more spirits over!
After the spirits dispersed, Guan Yin who stood by Ye Xuan's side shook his head and smiled, "What a formidable little fellow!"
Ye Xuan nodded and smiled, "He really is formidable!"
As he spoke, he glanced at the direction that the spirits had left in the sky.
Guan Yin said, "Don't worry, someone will protect them from the shadows!"
Ye Xuan nodded, "Take good care of them. Since they trust us, then we have to live up to their trust!"
Guan Yin nodded, "Of course!"
Meanwhile, Xiao Ling'er ran over to Ye Xuan and Guan Yin, and Xiao Ling'er grinned, "Big Sister Guan Yin, Big Brother!"
Ye Xuan lightly rubbed Xiao Ling'er's little head and smiled, "Was it fun?"
Xiao Ling'er hurriedly said, "I wasn't playing, I was doing serious business!"
Ye Xuan laughed, "Right!
Let's do serious business! "
Xiao Ling'er blinked, "Big Brother, I still want the Fortune Divine Crystals!
You know, the development of our Spirit Sect requires a lot of money … "
Ye Xuan, "…"
At the side, Guan Yin shook her head and smiled.
Ye Xuan took out a storage ring and handed it to Xiao Ling'er, "For you!"
Xiao Ling'er giggled and hurriedly took the storage ring!
Ye Xuan said seriously, "There are many places in the Fifth Dimension that require the help of these spirits. When the time comes, you have to cooperate with Big Sister Guan Yin, understand?"
He knew that these spirits were very obedient to Xiao Ling'er.
Xiao Ling'er hurriedly nodded, "Of course!"
Ye Xuan was about to speak, but at this time, the space in front of him trembled slightly.
Ye Xuan frowned.
Guan Yin looked at Ye Xuan, "What is it?"
Ye Xuan said in a low voice, "I want to return to the Dual Realm Abyss!"
After saying this, he directly turned around and disappeared.
At the scene, Guan Yin frowned deeply. Something happened?
.....









Chapter 1385
Two Realms Abyss, Heavenly King Hall.
Chi Yaoyao was already waiting for Ye Xuan the moment he entered the hall.
Ye Xuan said solemnly, "Did something happen?"
She nodded, "It's not a bad thing, but it's not good either!"
Ye Xuan looked at her, "What do you mean?"
Qing Yaoyao said in a low voice, "A black vortex has appeared in the Two Worlds Abyss. We can sense an extremely pure spiritual aura within it. Our initial estimate is that there are at least ten supreme-grade spirit veins inside, and there might even be the legendary supreme-grade spirit veins!"
Ye Xuan frowned, "Black vortex?
How did it appear? "
She shook her head, "We explored it!
Do you know how deep this Heaven Realm Abyss is? "
Ye Xuan shook his head.
She said, "The interior of this Heaven Realm Abyss is bottomless. Even now, we can't explore it completely!"
Ye Xuan was puzzled, "Even the Dao Tomb and Daoting can't do it?"
She smiled, "Do you know the origin of Heaven Realm Abyss?"
Ye Xuan shook his head.
He actually didn't know much about Heaven Realm Abyss!
She said softly, "Actually, we don't know either!"
Ye Xuan was stunned, "You don't know either?"
Qian Yaoyao nodded, "This place has existed longer than us and the Dao Court!
We've been exploring this Heaven Realm Abyss all these years, but we still haven't fully explored it! "
Ye Xuan frowned, "So mysterious?"
She smiled, "It's not just mysterious!
There's a flow of air in the depths of this Heaven Realm Abyss. It's extremely strange, and even Dao Controlling experts can't resist it. The deeper we go, the stronger the flow!
In the past ten years, we and Daoting have explored Heaven Realm Abyss, and more than sixty Dao Controlling experts have died! "
Ye Xuan said softly, "In other words, none of you have been to the bottom of this Heaven Realm Abyss?"
She nodded, "According to my guess, the Heaven Realm Abyss we've explored may not even be a third of it!"
One-third!
Ye Xuan was visibly moved!
If less than a third of it had been excavated, then this Heaven Realm Abyss would be extraordinarily terrifying!
How many spirit veins were there in the depths of the Heaven Realm Abyss?
Just thinking about it made one's blood boil!
Meanwhile, Qing Yaoyao suddenly said, "Don't think too much about it!
The deepest place we can probe is the Dark Realm. We can't even enter the Dark Realm right now. This time, the black vortex appeared at the edge of the Dark Realm.
This time, I asked you to come here because I want you to make a trip there. Is there any problem? "
Ye Xuan blinked. "Me?"
Ting Yaoyao nodded.
Ye Xuan was a little puzzled. "You and Rahu are stronger. Why don't you go?"
Qian Yaoyao smiled and said, "If we go!
Who is going to block the Daoting for you?
Do you think the Daoting will just stand and watch when such a black vortex suddenly appears?
They would definitely intervene!
As for us, we have to stop White Robe and the others!
No matter how I think about it, you're the most suitable! "
Ye Xuan grinned. "Are there any benefits?"
Qian Yaoyao walked in front of Ye Xuan and looked at Ye Xuan. "Are you afraid you won't be able to reap any benefits if you go there?"
Ye Xuan said seriously, "Actually, I'm just asking!
I'm an ally of the Dao Tomb. I, Ye Xuan, am duty-bound to do things for my allies! "
The corners of Qian Yaoyao's mouth curled up. "I like your shamelessness!"
Ye Xuan: "…"
Qian Yaoyao returned to her seat. She picked up her teacup and took a small sip. After a short while, she said, "This is a fortuitous encounter. A fortuitous encounter for my Dao Tomb, and a fortuitous encounter for you, Ye Xuan!
But I have to tell you this.
The Daoting will definitely intervene!
It's just that I don't know how they will intervene!
All we can do is block White Robe and the others for you. You will have to face the remaining danger yourself!
Is there a problem? "
Ye Xuan shook his head. "No problem!"
Qian Yaoyao nodded. "Then go!"
Ye Xuan hesitated for a moment. "Miss Yaoyao, is the Dark World dangerous?"
Qian Yaoyao looked at Ye Xuan. "It's very dangerous for others, but I don't think it's that dangerous for you!"
Ye Xuan was puzzled. "Why?"
The corners of Qian Yaoyao's mouth curled up. "Haven't you heard of this saying?
A shameless person is invincible. I think you're invincible. What's a mere Dark World to you? "
Ye Xuan's face darkened. Was that even human?
Chi Yaoyao suddenly said seriously, "Be careful of the Daoting!
Be careful of that black vortex as well. The sudden appearance of that black vortex isn't normal. You have to be careful! "
Ye Xuan said in a low voice, "Miss Yaoyao, have you gone in?"
Qian Yaoyao nodded. "I have. However, I was only able to reach the edge of the black vortex. I can't take it any further!"
Ye Xuan was puzzled. "Then what makes all of you think that I can take it?"
Qian Yaoyao gazed at Ye Xuan. "Do you know what it is that I can't take it?"
Ye Xuan was quite curious. "What is it?"
Qian Yaoyao said softly, "Sword energy!
Peerlessly powerful sword energy! "
Sword energy!
Ye Xuan was stunned, and then he said, "There's sword energy?"
Qian Yaoyao nodded. "Extremely powerful sword energy!
The reason we're letting you go is naturally not because we want you to give your life away!
Since you can absorb sword energy, perhaps you can enter that vortex and investigate it! "
Ye Xuan came to an understanding when he heard this.
If it wasn't for this reason, the Dao Tomb probably wouldn't have told him about the black vortex at all!
There are at least a dozen top-grade spirit veins in there!
There are even transcendent-grade spirit veins!
The Dao Tomb has come to find me because it has no other choice!
When he thought up to this point, Ye Xuan smiled and said, "I'll go!"
Qian Yaoyao nodded lightly. "Be careful!"
Ye Xuan stood up and left.
Meanwhile, Qian Yaoyao suddenly said, "Have you broken through?"
Ye Xuan turned around to look at Qian Yaoyao with a puzzled expression. "No!"
Qian Yaoyao gazed at Ye Xuan. "You haven't?"
Ye Xuan nodded. "I'm still at the Dao Corroboration Realm!"
Qian Yaoyao smiled. "I thought you'd broken through!"
Ye Xuan smiled. "Why does Miss Yaoyao say that?"
Qian Yaoyao took a sip of tea and said, "Do you know why a person's feet are whiter than their hands?"
Ye Xuan was slightly puzzled. "Why?"
Qian Yaoyao smiled. "Because your feet are always hidden!
But if you're wearing sandals, then how would you hide them? "
Ye Xuan fell silent for a moment before he said softly, "Thank you!"
With that, he turned around and left.
The moment he turned around, his expression was incomparably solemn.
He knew that Qian Yaoyao had discovered his physical breakthrough.
This time, he had been careless!
Although he had concealed his physical presence, he hadn't used the Prison Pagoda to conceal it!
It was obvious that his current strength wasn't enough to hide from experts of Qian Yaoyao's level. He had to use the Prison Pagoda!
Outside the hall, Ye Xuan lightly patted his face and said softly, "I have to be more careful!"
With that, he turned into a streak of sword light and disappeared into the distance.
Inside the hall, Qian Yaoyao swirled the teacup in her hand and said softly, "Physical body … is it that scroll?
Is it because of the Dao Scripture? "
With that, she slowly closed her eyes.
....
Divine Palace.
Bai Dizi, White Robe, and the True Martial Divine Lord were all here!
They already knew about the black vortex in the Dark World.
At this moment, White Robe suddenly said, "My people have found out that the black vortex isn't a plot of the Dao Tomb!
However, the vortex contains extremely powerful sword qi. Luo Hou and Qian Yaoyao don't dare to enter it! "
Bai Dizi suddenly said, "Ye Xuan will go!"
White Robe looked at Ye Xuan. "Why?"
Bai Dizi said softly, "Because that shameless guy can absorb sword qi!"
With that, he frowned slightly. "What a coincidence.
This black vortex seems to have appeared for Ye Xuan … "
The True Martial Divine Lord suddenly said, "White Robe, you've been to the Dark World. What's inside?"
White Robe was silent for a moment, then said, "Turbid qi, a lot of it. It can corrode a person's lifespan and physical body."
True Martial frowned slightly. "Can't resist it?"
White Robe shook his head. "Difficult to resist!
The deeper you go, the more turbid qi there is. If you come into contact with too much of it, you will enter the Angel Decay Stage Five early. "
True Martial was silent.
The Angel Decay Stage Five. Once you entered this state, you were not far from death!
Bai Dizi suddenly said, "Can Ye Xuan resist the turbid qi?"
White Robe shook his head. "In terms of strength, he can't!
Far from it!
But this person is quite mysterious. I'm not sure if he has any other way to resist the turbid qi! "
Bai Dizi was silent.
In his heart, this Ye Xuan was omnipotent!
At this moment, the True Martial Divine Lord suddenly said, "This might be our chance!
A chance to kill Ye Xuan!
Because after he enters the Dark World, the experts of the Dao Tomb won't be able to enter.
If we kill him in there, the Dao Tomb won't be able to intervene! "
White Robe shook his head. "We can't enter the Dao Tomb either!"
The True Martial Divine Lord suddenly said softly, "Taoist robe!"
Taoist robe!
Bai Dizi frowned. "Can it resist the turbid qi?"
With that, he looked at White Robe.
After a moment of silence, White Robe said, "It can resist it for about an hour!
But the Taoist robe will be destroyed!
Moreover, Ye Xuan will go to that small vortex, but he might not enter the Dark World. If he doesn't enter the Dark World and stays at the edge of the Dark World, the Tomb of Dao will immediately attack us! "
The True Martial Divine Lord said solemnly, "Bet that he will enter the Dark World!"
Bet!
Both Bai Dizi and White Robe were silent.
The True Martial Divine Lord looked at White Robe. "If you attack, Ye Xuan alone, how confident are you that you can kill him?"
White Robe said, "Eighty percent!
That's if he hasn't reached Dao Imperial! "
The True Martial Divine Lord slowly closed his eyes. "Eighty percent!
That's enough!
It's worth the bet! "
With that, he looked at Bai Dizi. Bai Dizi stood up. "I'll go get the Taoist robe!"
With that, he turned and disappeared.
In the hall, the True Martial Divine Lord said softly, "Unfortunately, this person isn't Daoting. Otherwise, he would be able to help us destroy the Dao Tomb!"
If Ye Xuan was Daoting and Daoting, he would definitely have a chance to reach the level of a Dao Ancestor in the future!
Moreover, if another expert of this level were to appear, then destroying the Dao Tomb would be a piece of cake!
Unfortunately, Ye Xuan wasn't Daoting!
Not only that, but they had to get rid of Ye Xuan!
At all costs!
.....









Chapter 1386
Dark World!
When Ye Xuan arrived in the Dark World, his expression turned grave!
The Dark World was pitch-black, and within that pitch-black space, there were some air currents that made him feel threatened!
Turbid air!
Even Dao Manipulation experts would find it hard to resist these air currents!
Ye Xuan looked to his right and saw a pitch-black vortex not far away!
The vortex was huge, and he could feel pure spiritual energy and sword qi in its depths!
Sword qi!
Ye Xuan was curious, just how strong was this sword qi?
Even experts like Qian Yaoyao and Luo Hou found it hard to resist!
Could it be left behind by the three swords?
Ye Xuan walked towards the black vortex.
Ye Zhiming suddenly said, "Be careful!"
Ye Xuan nodded.
He naturally didn't dare to be careless in a place like Heaven Abyss.
Soon, Ye Xuan approached the black vortex. As if thinking of something, he turned to look, but there was no one in the distance.
But he knew someone was in the dark!
Some were from the Dao Court, and some were from the Dao Tomb!
Ye Xuan was silent where he stood.
Ye Zhiming suddenly asked, "What is it?"
Ye Xuan chuckled, "What do you think Daoting will do to kill me?"
Ye Zhiming was silent.
Ye Xuan looked at the black vortex, and after a long silence, he quickly walked into it.
...
Somewhere in the dark, Luo Hou whispered, "Can he even absorb the sword qi in there?"
Bitter King and Qian Yaoyao were beside Luo Hou!
Qian Yaoyao smiled, "We'll know soon enough!"
As she spoke, she turned her head and looked somewhere. "What do you think the Dao Court will do?"
Bitter King said solemnly, "He won't give up!"
Qian Yaoyao slowly closed her eyes, no one knew what she was thinking.
Luo Hou suddenly said, "Why is there sword qi in there?"
Chi Yaoyao said, "Because someone went in?"
"Who?"
Bitter King asked.
Qian Yaoyao shook her head. "I don't know!"
As she spoke, she glanced at the Dark World in the distance and said softly, "Ever since I found out about Mu Niannian, I've realized that we've become slightly weak!"
Before she met Mu Niannian, she had always felt that they were the most powerful people in this world!
However, after meeting Mu Niannian, she suddenly realized that they were very weak!
This was the way of the world. When you thought you had reached the ceiling, little did you know that there was an even higher existence.
...
On the other side, Bai Dizi and True Martial Divine Lord were watching in secret.
They had investigated this new black vortex for a long time, but to no avail.
They didn't fight over it, because it was meaningless. There was a powerful Sword Qi inside. If they couldn't enter the Dao Tomb, they couldn't enter either!
However, Ye Xuan could enter!
Could Ye Xuan absorb the Sword Qi inside?
They were curious as well!
The Sword Qi inside was no ordinary Sword Qi. Even experts like Qian Yaoyao and Luo Hou couldn't resist it. How terrifying was it?
Could Ye Xuan absorb such a powerful Sword Qi?
...
After Ye Xuan entered the vortex, a wave of pure Spirit Qi hit him in the face!
Ye Xuan quickened his pace and soon arrived at a starry sky.
There was another world inside this vortex!
The starry sky was deep and boundless!
At this moment, he suddenly turned around.
Because he sensed a strand of Sword Qi in the distant depths!
An unfamiliar Sword Qi!
He was more familiar with the Sword Qi of the Three Swords, but the Sword Qi before him didn't belong to any of them.
After a moment of silence, Ye Xuan walked toward the source of the Sword Qi.
The further he went, the more serious Ye Xuan's expression became. Not only did he feel a powerful Sword Qi, but also a powerful Sword Force!
It was countless times stronger than the True Martial Divine Lord's Sword Force!
At this moment, Ye Xuan was a little shocked. Apart from the Three Swords and Sister Nian, there was actually such a powerful Swordsman in this world?
Who was it?
Ye Xuan's curiosity grew.
At this moment, he suddenly stopped. A corpse floated dozens of feet in front of him.
Ye Xuan sized up the corpse. There was a sword mark on the corpse's throat.
A single slash!
Ye Xuan walked up to the corpse and took a look at it. The body was still there, but the soul was gone. It must have been annihilated!
Ye Xuan frowned slightly. He lifted his head and looked into the distance. What on earth was this place?
Ye Xuan's curiosity grew, and he became even more cautious!
Although he had cultivated a Dao Body, that didn't mean he was invincible!
He couldn't be arrogant at any time!
Ye Xuan continued walking forward. After walking for a short while, he suddenly stopped. At this moment, a beam of sword energy cut through the air and slashed towards him.
The Sword Qi was like a bolt of lightning. By the time Ye Xuan sensed it, the Sword Qi was already in front of him.
Ye Xuan's expression changed!
He didn't expect the Sword Qi to be so fast!
At this moment, he didn't even have a chance to fight back. He could only let the Sword Qi cut him.
At this moment, Ye Xuan only hoped that his Invincible Sword Body would be useful!
Chi!
As a tearing sound came, Ye Xuan retreated almost ten thousand feet away. As soon as he stopped, the space around him cracked, and the cracks spread tens of thousands of miles away in an instant!
And there was a Sword Qi stuck in Ye Xuan's chest!
Ye Xuan's body stiffened in the starry sky. His expression was extremely solemn.
Because his body couldn't absorb the Sword Qi!
However, the Sword Qi couldn't hurt him either!
Even though the Sword Qi had entered his body, it didn't hurt him. However, he couldn't absorb the Sword Qi either!
It was very strange!
Even Ye Xuan was confused.
What's going on?
Meanwhile, Ye Zhiming suddenly said, "The Sword Qi can't hurt you, but your physique can't absorb it either. So, there's only one explanation. Your Invincible Sword Body is very strong, but you're not strong enough to absorb the Sword Qi!
The Sword Qi's owner's attainments in the Sword Dao might be similar to Mu Niannian's, only inferior to Three Swords. "
Only inferior to Three Swords!
Ye Xuan frowned slightly. He looked into the distance. There's such a powerful Swordsman in this world!
After a moment of silence, Ye Xuan slowly pulled out the Sword Qi. One could tell a person just by looking at the Sword Qi. Ye Xuan's expression gradually became solemn as he looked at the Sword Qi in his hand.
The Sword Qi's owner's attainments in the Sword Dao were probably only inferior to Three Swords.
As for Sister Nian, he hadn't seen her at her peak, so he didn't know who was stronger between the Sword Qi's owner and Sister Nian!
At this moment, Ye Zhiming suddenly said, "The Sword Qi isn't resisting?"
Hearing this, Ye Xuan was stunned!
Only now did he realize that the Sword Qi in his hand didn't resist?
What's going on?
Ye Xuan looked at the Sword Qi in his hand. The Sword Qi was trembling slightly, but it didn't resist him.
Ye Zhiming said in a low voice, "Don't tell me the Sword Qi's owner is related to you again!"
She was speechless towards Ye Xuan.
How many people does this guy have backing?
Not to mention her, even he himself probably doesn't know!
Wherever he goes, he has backing!
Ye Xuan said in a low voice, "I've never seen the Sword Qi's aura before, so I don't think I know the Sword Qi's owner!"
Ye Zhiming said in a low voice, "Just because you don't know him doesn't mean he doesn't know you!"
Ye Xuan was speechless.
Ye Zhiming continued, "No matter what, since the Sword Qi isn't resisting you, it means that the Sword Qi's owner might know you. Let's go ahead and take a look!"
Ye Xuan nodded slightly and put the Sword Qi away.
Although the Sword Qi had left its owner, with the Sword Dao's attainments, the Sword Qi would last for at least ten thousand years!
Fifteen minutes later, Ye Xuan suddenly stopped on his sword. There was a top-grade ore vein not far away from him!
A top-grade ore vein!
Ye Xuan was slightly excited. He and the others had entered the ore vein, but when they entered, Ye Xuan was stunned!
This top-grade ore vein was filled to the brim with fortune divine crystals!
There were at least 300,000 of them!
300,000 Divine Fortune Crystals!
What did that mean?
Ye Xuan was so excited that he almost couldn't control himself!
The ore vein here had not been developed by anyone, so it contained a large number of Divine Fortune Crystals!
Most importantly, these Divine Fortune Crystals were different from the ones he had seen outside. They were completely different!
These Divine Fortune Crystals were the size of a fist and were dark purple in color. The energy contained within them was several times purer than the Divine Fortune Crystals outside!
At this moment, Ye Zhiming suddenly said softly, "These Divine Fortune Crystals have not been taken away by anyone. They can grow continuously in this ore vein … Congratulations, you're rich!"
Ye Xuan was so happy that he couldn't close his mouth!
How many experts could be nurtured in the Fifth Dimension with more than three hundred thousand pure Divine Crystals of Fortune?
He could nurture a large number of Dao Validation and Dao Defense Realm experts!
Most importantly, there was more than just this top-grade ore vein in this black hole!
Thinking of this, Ye Xuan couldn't help but laugh!
Ye Xuan hurriedly put away the Divine Fortune Crystals. Not only did he put away the Divine Fortune Crystals, but he also put away the entire ore vein!
At this moment, he also understood one thing, and that was that the longer these Divine Fortune Crystals stayed in this ore vein, the better.
After putting away the Divine Fortune Crystals and the top-grade ore vein, Ye Xuan continued forward. At this moment, another Sword Qi slashed at him from afar. However, he didn't panic at all!
As he expected, the Sword Qi stopped five feet in front of him!
Ye Xuan put away the Sword Qi!
He continued forward!
Along the way, Ye Xuan walked with the wind, feeling very proud of himself!
Along the way, Ye Xuan suddenly smiled. "Zhiming, do you have any thoughts?"
Ye Zhiming was silent for a moment before saying, "Cheater!"
Ye Xuan blinked. "What do you mean?"
Ye Zhiming said calmly, "I saw this phrase in an ancient book. It's said that it came from the Milky Way Realm. It means that if you don't abide by the rules, your life will be like cheaters, just like you are now!"
Ye Xuan frowned slightly. "Why does it sound like a bad phrase to me?"
Ye Zhiming said, "I don't know either. In any case, many of the words there are a bit strange!
I looked at that ancient book and was also confused because I couldn't explain many of the words.
For example, this cheater, what is cheater?
What is cheater?
Why is it combined to describe people who don't abide by the rules?
I can't understand it! "
Ye Xuan, "…"
.....
PS: I don't ask for votes, I don't ask for rewards, just write more and write a good book!









Chapter 1387
Cheater?
Ye Xuan shook his head. What a strange word.
Ye Zhiming suddenly said, "Don't dwell on this problem!
It's meaningless! "
Ye Xuan nodded and sped up. Along the way, he encountered more sword qi, and he noticed that these sword qi were scattered in space and would attack anyone they saw.
Obviously, a great battle had happened in this part of space!
After flying on the sword for about an hour, Ye Xuan saw another ore vein!
There were over two hundred thousand fortune divine crystals in that ore vein!
Without any hesitation, Ye Xuan put away the ore vein!
Now, he had two top-grade ore veins and over four hundred thousand fortune divine crystals!
This was simply a sudden windfall!
Even though the number of fortune divine crystals was increasing, Ye Xuan felt uneasy.
There was clearly something wrong with this place. Besides sword qi and ore veins, he also saw corpses along the way!
Judging from the corpses, they were all super experts when they were alive!
After a while, Ye Xuan suddenly stopped. In the starry sky not far away from him, there was a giant starship floating in the sky. The entire starship was like a ghost floating in the starry sky, extremely creepy and creepy!
Ye Xuan frowned slightly. What the hell is that?
Ye Zhiming suddenly said, "Be careful!"
Ye Xuan nodded and walked towards the starship. When he got close to it, he felt a powerful aura again!
Ye Xuan stopped in his tracks, and he became even more vigilant!
Just as he was about to slip away, the starship shook violently, and then footsteps came from inside the starship.
The corners of Ye Xuan's mouth twitched.
Someone's here!
Ye Xuan looked at the starship in front of him. Under his gaze, an old man walked out from the starship. The old man wore a loose grey robe, and he held a walking stick in his hand. His aura was faint, and it was extremely strange!
Ye Xuan looked at the old man, but he didn't say a word.
At this moment, the old man was also looking at Ye Xuan.
After a short moment, the old man suddenly said in a hoarse voice, "Why aren't you afraid of the sword qi?"
Ye Xuan waved the sword in his hand. "I'm also a Swordsman!"
The elder stared at Ye Xuan. "Your attainments in the Sword Dao are far inferior to the owner of this sword energy!"
Ye Xuan said, "All Swordsman in the world are one family. We don't fight each other!"
The old man frowned. "What nonsense are you talking about?"
Ye Xuan was speechless.
The old man continued, "Those sword qi won't hurt you!
What is your relationship with the owner of the sword Qi? "
Ye Xuan thought for a moment, and then he said, "It's my first time here, so I don't know why that sword qi didn't harm me!"
This time, he wasn't fooling around. What a joke. If the owner of the sword qi had a grudge against this old man, then wouldn't he be courting death?
The old man looked at Ye Xuan without saying a word.
Ye Xuan sized up the surroundings and said, "Senior, where are we?"
The old man replied, "The Dark Dimension!"
Ye Xuan spoke in a low voice, "Senior, are you from the depths of the Dark Dimension?"
The old man shook his head. "I'm from the outside world!"
Ye Xuan blinked. "The outside world?"
The old man gazed at Ye Xuan and didn't speak.
Ye Xuan's heart shook. Dammit! This old man wants to kill me!
Because he sensed a strand of killing intent!
Even though the old man's killing intent was very well concealed, he'd still noticed it!
Because he'd attained his Dao through slaughter, so he was extremely sensitive to killing intent!
The old man's right hand slowly clenched tightly within his wide sleeves.
Meanwhile, Ye Xuan suddenly said, "Senior, to tell you the truth, I'm here to look for my dad!"
The old man frowned slightly. "Dad?"
Ye Xuan nodded. "Yes. Senior, have you seen him?"
The old man gazed at Ye Xuan. "No!"
Dammit! Who knows who your dad is?
Meanwhile, Ye Xuan opened his palm. Instantly, the blood in his body trembled.
Bloodline Power!
When he saw Ye Xuan's bloodline Power, the old man's expression changed!
Ye Xuan looked at the old man. "My dad's bloodline is the same as mine. Senior, have you seen someone with such a bloodline?"
The old man stared fixedly at the boiling blood in Ye Xuan's body. His expression gradually became solemn.
Needless to say, he was quite shocked at this moment.
What bloodline is this?
It's actually so strong!
Who is this young man in front of me?
Meanwhile, Ye Xuan suddenly retracted his bloodline Power. He cupped his fists at the old man and asked, "I wonder if Senior has seen him before?"
The old man was silent for a moment and shook his head. "Never!"
With that, he paused for a moment and said, "Young friend, your bloodline Power is quite special!"
At this moment, his killing intent was gone.
What was the thing that a person was most afraid of in their lifetime of cultivation?
They were afraid of forming evil karma and bad karma!
This world was too dangerous, so one had to be extremely careful in the outside world.
Especially some people that one absolutely couldn't afford to offend. Once they did, it would be like stirring a hornet's nest. If one were to beat the young, then the old would come, and if one were to beat the old, then a group of old would come ….
But this young man before him was obviously someone with backing, and it was no ordinary backing!
Once he killed him, there would be no end to future troubles!
Ye Xuan smiled, "Senior's aura is as deep as the ocean. I'm afraid you've attained the Dao, right?"
The old man nodded.
Attained the Dao!
The corners of Ye Xuan's mouth twitched. Dammit! This old man has attained the Dao. No wonder I felt so dangerous!
I've actually encountered a Dao Realm expert!
One must know that even if the Dao Court and the Dao Tomb were to be added together, there were only four cultivators at the Dao Realm!
Meanwhile, the old man spoke abruptly, "With your strength, you shouldn't have stepped foot here."
Ye Xuan spoke in a low voice, "Senior, what sort of place is the Dark Dimension?"
The old man hesitated for a moment and said, "You don't know, yet you still dared to come here …."
Ye Xuan blinked and said, "Is this place very dangerous?"
The old man gazed at Ye Xuan, "Isn't it?"
Ye Xuan glanced at the surroundings and smiled embarrassedly, "I don't think it's dangerous at all!"
The old man was speechless.
Not dangerous?
I almost killed you just now!
You're not dangerous at all!
Ye Xuan spoke with a serious expression, "My older brother said that you shouldn't be afraid of death!
Young man, don't be afraid of death. You should temper yourself! "
The old man gazed at Ye Xuan, "Your older brother?"
Ye Xuan nodded, and then he withdrew a sword from the top of the pagoda, "My older brother gave this to me!"
It was the sword of the Swordsman who wore a cloud white robe!
The old man's expression instantly turned solemn when he saw the sword of the Founding Ancestor of the Immortal Banished Island.
The stronger one was, the more one would be able to sense how formidable those 3 swords were!
The old man gazed at Ye Xuan, "This … is your older brother?"
Ye Xuan nodded, "Yes."
The old man hesitated for a moment, "Young friend, you …."
Needless to say, he was quite shocked at this moment.
Who exactly is this young man?
Ye Xuan glanced at the surroundings, and then he said, "Senior, have you been to the depths of the Dark Dimension?"
The old man shook his head, "I haven't. There's muddy energy there, and it's difficult for ordinary people to resist it!"
As he spoke, he gazed at Ye Xuan, "It's best that you don't go there as well. The muddy energy there isn't something you can resist right now!"
Ye Xuan nodded.
"I'm not going!"
The old man cupped his fists, "Young friend, I have something to attend to, so I'll be taking my leave!"
Obviously, he intended to ask Ye Xuan to get off the pagoda!
Ye Xuan spoke in a low voice, "Senior, do you know the origins of this sword energy?"
The old man shook his head, "I don't know. I only know that a great battle took place here in the past."
At this point, he seemed to have thought of something, and he gazed at Ye Xuan, "Young friend, this sword energy isn't able to harm you?"
Ye Xuan grinned, and then he took out a strand of sword energy, "I don't know why this sword energy isn't able to harm me!"
The old man fell silent as he gazed at the sword energy in Ye Xuan's hand that didn't resist it.
The sword energy actually didn't resist!
What the hell?
The old man found it hard to comprehend!
Meanwhile, Ye Xuan spoke abruptly, "Senior, may I ask why you're here?"
The old man replied, "To settle some matters!"
Ye Xuan spoke in a low voice, "Senior, please forgive me for speaking out of turn, but you're neither from the Daoting Dao Tomb, right?"
The old man nodded, "No!
However, I've heard of these two powers!
Are you from the Daoting Dao Tomb or the Daoting Dao Tomb? "
Ye Xuan smiled, "I'm from the Fifth Dimension, and I'm temporarily allied with the Daoting Dao Tomb!"
The old man frowned, "As far as I know, the Daoting Dao Ancestor is the only one with decent strength, but your father and brother should be able to kill him without any pressure!"
Ye Xuan bitterly smiled, "There's no other way, they want to train me so that I can face everything by myself!
Unless it's absolutely necessary, they won't make a move! "
The old man was silent.
It's good to have a backer, you can do whatever you want!
The old man withdrew his thoughts, and glanced at Ye Xuan, "Young friend, I still have something to do, so I'll take my leave first!"
Ye Xuan smiled, "Senior, farewell!"
As soon as he finished speaking, he left the starship.
The old man cupped his fists and was about to leave. Meanwhile, he seemed to have thought of something, and he hesitated for a moment before he said, "Young friend, there's a ruin up ahead, and it used to belong to an ancient power. I came here for that ruin. However, that ancient ruin is slightly special. Not only is there a huge amount of Muddy Qi outside, there's even powerful Sword Qi there. The Sword Qi is so strong that even I can't resist it."
When he spoke up to this point, he paused for a moment before he continued, "Young friend, are you interested in going with me to have a look?"
Ye Xuan blinked but didn't speak.
Why did this old man invite me?
As if he knew what Ye Xuan was thinking, the old man smiled, "I have no ill intentions towards you. To be honest, I've been investigating some matters in the outside world for the past few years, and I just happened to find that ruin. However, the Sword Qi there is extremely strong, and even I can't resist it!
I originally wanted to give up, but after I met you …. "
Ye Xuan understood when he heard this!
The old man smiled, "The Sword Qi isn't able to harm you, so it shouldn't be a problem if you intend to enter the ruin!"
Ye Xuan fell silent.
The old man continued, "Don't worry, I won't take any of the wealth there. I'm only going there to investigate something!"
Ye Xuan smiled, "How could that do?
I'll go with you, and we'll split the wealth equally! "
The old man grinned, "To tell you the truth, Old Man isn't an independent cultivator. So, wealth is like floating clouds to me!"
Ye Xuan thought for a moment before he smiled, "Senior, let's go!"
As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan sat on the old man's starship and continued forward.
It didn't take long for an enormous stone door to appear within Ye Xuan's field of vision.
There were two large words above the stone door — Sword Sect!
The Sword Sect!
Ye Xuan was stunned when he saw these two words.
The Sword Sect?
To Ye Xuan, this trip to the Sword Sect was like returning home!
It was extremely intimate!
....









Chapter 1388
The Sword Sect!
There was a turbid aura drifting around the stone door. Apart from that, there was also some sword aura drifting around.
The sword energy was very strong, extremely strong!
The old man had a solemn expression in his eyes when he saw the sword energy.
He'd been here once in the past, but he hadn't dared to go over!
The muddy energy wasn't too bad because he could resist it, but the sword energy was strong to the point of killing him.
If it was just pure sword energy, then he could resist it. But this place was quite strange, and he didn't want to take the risk.
Actually, he was extremely shocked when he'd just arrived here!
Whose sword energy is still so strong even after a few tens of thousands of years!?
The old man sighed in his heart. As expected, there's always someone stronger in the world!
Meanwhile, Ye Xuan walked towards the stone door. The old man hurriedly said, "Young Brother, be careful!"
Ye Xuan nodded and walked towards the stone door. Even though he was confident in his ability, he still didn't dare be careless!
When he arrived over 30m away from the stone door, the sword energy that drifted around the stone door suddenly stopped moving. In the next moment, the sword energy transformed into rays of light that slashed towards Ye Xuan!
The old man's expression instantly changed drastically when he witnessed this scene. But he was stunned in the next moment!
Because the countless rays of sword energy had stopped in front of Ye Xuan!
All the rays of sword energy had stopped in front of Ye Xuan!
The old man blinked. Are they really not going to target this fellow?
Ye Xuan heaved a sigh of relief when he saw the rays of sword energy stop!
The rays of sword energy were extremely formidable, and it would be extremely troublesome if they were really targeting him!
Because his sword was temporarily unable to absorb them!
Ye Xuan didn't think too much about it and put them away.
Meanwhile, the old man walked over to Ye Xuan's side, and then he glanced at Ye Xuan and exclaimed with admiration, "Young Brother, you're truly an extraordinary person!"
Ye Xuan smiled, "Senior, do you have a way to deal with the muddy energy?"
The old man nodded, "The muddy energy here is much inferior to the depths of the Dark Dimension. I can deal with it!"
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "Then let's go in!"
The two of them continued forward. Along the way, the old man waved his right hand and the turbid energy was blocked by a mysterious force.
Ye Xuan glanced at the old man. This old man's strength was not ordinary!
Behind the mountain gate were some ancient buildings. However, these buildings were extremely dilapidated. Some of them had even collapsed into ruins!
It was obvious that a great battle had taken place here!
At this time, the two of them arrived in front of a large hall. Half of the hall had already collapsed, leaving only the other half. It looked very desolate.
Right at this moment, the old man suddenly said, "Young Friend, watch out!"
With that said, he waved his right hand, and a black shadow in front of Ye Xuan was directly pushed back!
Ye Xuan gripped the sword tightly in his left hand. He looked at the black shadow. The shadow dissipated, revealing an illusory middle-aged man!
A soul body!
Although it was a soul body, the other party's aura was very powerful!
Inside Ye Xuan's body, the Soul Suppressing Sword was ready to strike!
The middle-aged man looked at the old man, "Reaching the Dao!"
The old man was expressionless, but his eyes flickered with killing intent, "A mere Dark Abyss spirit dares to act rashly in front of this honored one!"
With that said, he pointed forward with his fingers, and a wave of cold and gloomy energy swept out!
In the distance, the middle-aged man's expression changed drastically. He suddenly punched out.
Boom!
With a loud explosion, the middle-aged man retreated rapidly. This time, he retreated hundreds of feet away!
But the old man did not retreat a single step!
Ye Xuan glanced at the old man. This old man's strength was definitely above Luo Hu and the others.
Reaching the Dao Realm!
He was really strong!
The middle-aged man stared at the old man, "You know I come from the Dark Abyss. You are from the Ancient God Abyss!"
The old man was about to attack.
Ye Xuan suddenly smiled and said, "Senior, please wait."
The old man looked at Ye Xuan. Ye Xuan said, "Senior, you should also want to know what happened here, right?"
After a moment of silence, the old man looked at the middle-aged man, "What happened here?"
The middle-aged man did not speak, but stared at Ye Xuan, "You are from the Sword Sect!"
Ye Xuan frowned, "Just because I am a Swordsman, you think I am from the Sword Sect?"
The middle-aged man did not speak.
Ye Xuan looked at the old man, "Senior, what kind of place is this Dark Abyss?
Is it the Dark World? "
The old man shook his head, "No, the Dark Abyss is a place more terrifying than the Dark World!"
With that said, he looked at the middle-aged man, "Who killed you!"
The middle-aged man said in a low voice, "A woman!"
Woman!
The old man frowned, "How many of you died?"
The middle-aged man slowly clenched his fists, and his expression was ferocious, "More than thirty!"
Ye Xuan suddenly asked, "More than thirty Reaching the Dao Realm?"
The middle-aged man glanced at Ye Xuan, "Twelve Reaching the Dao Realm, eighteen Dao Defense Realm peak."
Hearing this, Ye Xuan fell silent.
He was shocked!
Twelve Reaching the Dao Realm!
What did this mean?
What kind of place was this Dark Abyss?
Why was it so strong?
At this moment, the old man suddenly said, "More than thirty of you were all killed by a woman?"
The middle-aged man ignored the old man, and looked at Ye Xuan, "Her sword aura did not hurt you, what's your relationship with her?"
Ye Xuan was silent.
He was sure that the owner of the sword aura was not Qing 'er, and among the women he knew, only Qing' er and Sister Nian's sword aura were this strong!
Apart from those two, he did not know any other female Swordsman!
At this moment, the middle-aged man said, "What's your relationship with her?"
Ye Xuan looked at the middle-aged man, "Take a guess!"
The old man was speechless.
The middle aged man was stunned, and then he spoke in a low voice, "She killed many of us!"
Ye Xuan's eyelids twitched. "I didn't kill her. What does it have to do with me?"
The middle-aged man looked at Ye Xuan. "What's the difference between her killing him and you killing him?"
Ye Xuan flew into a rage. "Are you kidding me?
Why is there no difference between her killing and me killing?
Go and find her if you can! "
The middle-aged man was expressionless. "Killing you is the same!"
Ye Xuan was so angry that his chest hurt!
Damn it, he was obviously picking on the weak one!
Thinking up to here, Ye Xuan opened his palm, and the Soul Suppressing Sword appeared in his hand. In the next moment, the Soul Suppressing Sword transformed into a ray of sword light and flew out!
In the distance, the middle-aged man's face drastically changed. He did not attack, but turned around and fled. His speed was extremely fast, and he disappeared into the distance in the blink of an eye.
Ye Xuan and the old man were both stunned.
Ye Xuan's face was a little ugly. Damn it, that guy ran away!
That person was at least at the Dao Attainment Realm. Although it was only a soul, if the other party chose to escape, there was nothing he could do!
Damn it, that guy wouldn't call someone to beat me up, would he?
Thinking up to here, Ye Xuan's face became even uglier!
The reason why the other party did not dare to escape before must be because of the sword qi. But now, he had taken away all the sword qi.
Thinking up to here, Ye Xuan was speechless.
At this moment, the old man glanced at the Soul Suppressing Sword in front of Ye Xuan. "Young friend, your sword has reached the Dao Attainment Realm!
What a good sword! "
Ye Xuan withdrew his thoughts and smiled. "It's just so-so!"
Saying so, he put away the Soul Suppressing Sword!
The old man said in a low voice, "Young friend, this Dark Yuan is not simple. You and them …"
Ye Xuan sighed softly. "Senior, you saw it too!
I have no enmity with them, but they insisted on pestering me. Tell me, is there any justice in this world?
Is there any law in this world? "
The old man hesitated for a moment and said, "Young friend, your identity isn't simple, so there's no need to pay too much attention to this Dark Yuan. However, you still have to be careful in the future!"
Ye Xuan nodded. "Thank you for the reminder, Senior!"
The old man nodded, and then he glanced at the surroundings. In the end, his gaze shot towards the depths of the ruined hall. There was a corpse there!
There was a sword by the corpse's side!
The old man walked over to the corpse and sized it up carefully. A short while later, he pressed his palm down lightly. "Condense!"
As soon as he finished speaking, the space in the surroundings suddenly trembled, and then an illusory soul appeared in front of the old man.
The old man looked at the illusory soul. "What happened here?"
The soul glanced at the surroundings in a daze. Suddenly, he looked at Ye Xuan, and he was stunned when he saw Ye Xuan.
Ye Xuan blinked. "Senior, you know me?"
The soul looked at Ye Xuan with slight disbelief. "You …."
At this point, he frowned. "How is this possible?"
Ye Xuan was slightly puzzled. "What do you mean?"
The old man glanced at Ye Xuan as well, and he was also bewildered!
The soul fell silent for a long time before he said, "You have the Ancestral Master's aura on you!"
Ye Xuan took out the Sword Spirit, "Is it this sword?"
When he saw the sword, the soul took a deep look at Ye Xuan. "You …."
Ye Xuan smiled, "I'm from the Sword Sect as well!"
The soul didn't speak.
Meanwhile, the old man suddenly asked, "What exactly happened here?"
The soul spoke softly, "Many years ago, our Sword Sect suffered a calamity. Some mysterious experts appeared in our Sword Sect and slaughtered our Sword Sect …."
Ye Xuan asked, "Why?"
The soul's expression was complicated. "Because of a super mineral vein!"
A super mineral vein!
Ye Xuan hurriedly asked, "A super mineral vein?"
The soul nodded. "Our Sword Sect obtained a super mineral vein in the Dark World. This mineral vein stretches for thousands of miles, and it has its own sentience … but we never thought that it would bring disaster to our Sword Sect!"
The old man said softly, "A super mineral vein … no wonder the Dark Abyss would act …."
The soul spoke again, "Back then, in order to avoid those experts, we used a formation to escape into the Dark World. But we never thought that those people would be even more terrifying than we imagined. They were not afraid of the turbid gas at all, and directly entered the Dark World to kill us …."
Ye Xuan said gravely, "But those experts from the Dark Abyss are also dead!
Who killed them? "
The soul replied gravely, "Ancestral Master!"
Ye Xuan asked, "The azure-robed man?"
The soul glanced at Ye Xuan and shook his head. "It's not Ancestral Master!"
Ye Xuan was a little curious. "It's not the azure-robed man?"
The soul nodded. "It's Ancestral Master Ting Yun!"
Ting Yun!
Ye Xuan was stunned.
He had heard Senior Sister Lu say this before, but he didn't take it to heart. Was Ting Yun that strong?
At this moment, the old man suddenly said, "Little friend, what's your relationship with this Senior Ting Yun?"
Ye Xuan blinked and said, "Senior Sister!
She's my Senior Sister! "
The old man fell silent.
Damn, your father is so freakish, your big brother is also freakish, your Senior Sister is also freakish ….
Who is this guy?
Is his whole family so terrifying?

Chapter 1389
Tingyun!
Ye Xuan was a little shocked at this moment because he really didn't expect Ting Yun's strength to be so terrifying!
Over a dozen Completed Dao Realm experts had been killed. This was simply not treating Completed Dao Realm experts as humans!
At this time, the middle-aged man's soul gradually became illusory.
Ye Xuan looked at the old man. The old man shook his head, "His soul was originally scattered. I forcefully gathered it. Now, his soul is extremely weak and is about to scatter from the world."
Ye Xuan thought for a moment, and then he opened his palm and the Soul Suppressing Sword appeared in front of the middle aged man. In the next moment, the Soul Suppressing Sword directly released a powerful soul force that enveloped the middle aged man, and the middle aged man's soul that was about to disperse suddenly condensed once more!
A trace of surprise flashed through the old man's eyes when he saw this. He glanced at the Soul Suppressing Sword but did not say anything.
In front of Ye Xuan, the middle-aged man shook his head and smiled. "It's meaningless!"
To a certain extent, his soul had already been destroyed!
Ye Xuan fell silent for a moment before he said, "I'll send you into reincarnation!"
Then, the mark of the God of Reincarnation suddenly appeared between his brows.
Seeing this scene, the old man was a little curious, "Little friend, is this the Reincarnation Great Dao?"
Ye Xuan nodded. "Senior, you also know about the Reincarnation Great Dao?"
The old man smiled and said, "Who doesn't know about the Three Thousand Great Daos?
This Samsara Grand Dao is ranked in the top ten amongst the 3,000 Grand Daos. If you make good use of it, it'll be of great use in the future! "
Ye Xuan blinked. "What great use?"
The old man hesitated for a moment before he said, "You don't know?"
Ye Xuan shook his head, "I don't know!
I obtained this Seal of the God's Will of the Reincarnation Dao by chance! "
He obtained it by chance!
The old man was speechless.
Meanwhile, Ye Xuan suddenly smiled and said, "Senior, let's talk later!"
With that, he looked at the middle-aged man. "Sir, enter the cycle of reincarnation!"
The middle-aged man took a deep look at Ye Xuan. "Take care!"
With that, he entered the Reincarnation Cave. Soon, the middle-aged man's soul completely disappeared.
Ye Xuan kept the Samsara Seal and looked at the old man. "Senior, what's the use of this Samsara God's Seal?"
In the past, he'd used it to reach the Dao Corroboration Realm. Now that he'd reached the Dao Corroboration Realm, he hadn't used the Samsara God's Seal in a very long time.
The old man said, "When you reach the Dao Formation Realm in the future, you can use the Divine Seal of Samsara!"
Ye Xuan blinked. "This God's Seal can help people achieve the Dao?"
The old man nodded. "Sure!
However, if you borrow the God's Seal to reach the Dao, it will be very difficult!
Furthermore, if you use this God's Seal to achieve Dao, you will be the Reincarnation Great Dao. Do you understand what I mean? "
Upon hearing this, Ye Xuan understood.
If he used the Reincarnation God's Seal to achieve the Dao, then he, Ye Xuan, would become the God's Seal. He, Ye Xuan, would be the Reincarnation Great Dao, one of the 3,000 Great Daos.
Ye Xuan gazed at the old man, "Is there a problem with that?"
The old man spoke in a low voice, "There's a huge problem!
Because it'll be difficult for you to break through again!
The Grand Dao of Samsara isn't a Dao that you've come up with on your own, it's the Dao of someone else. The Grand Dao of Samsara itself has reached its end. If you become it, then it means that attaining the Dao will be your end, and it'll be extremely difficult for you to continue breaking through.
However, attaining the Dao is the lifelong pursuit of many, and it all depends on one's own choice! "
Ye Xuan nodded and spoke softly, "I understand!"
The old man smiled, "Young Brother, I came here to investigate the Dark Abyss. Now that I've finished my investigation, I have to return to report on my mission!"
Ye Xuan gazed at the old man, "Senior, what's your name?"
The old man hesitated for a moment before he said, "Su Ke!"
Ye Xuan cupped his fists, "Senior Su Ke, we'll meet again!"
Su Ke cupped his fists as well, "Young Brother, we'll meet again!"
As soon as he finished speaking, he was about to leave. However, he seemed to have thought of something and said, "Young Brother, that expert from the Dark Abyss has fled. You have to be careful of the Dark Abyss because it isn't a simple place!"
Ye Xuan nodded, "Thank you for the warning, Senior!"
Su Ke continued, "Besides that, the muddy energy in the depths of the Dark World is extremely strong. Young Brother, you must not continue forward because you'll enter the depths of the Dark World if you continue forward. The muddy energy there isn't something you can resist right now!"
Ye Xuan turned around and glanced at the distance, but there was only pitch black darkness at the end of his vision.
The depths of the Dark World?
Ye Xuan fell into deep contemplation.
Su Ke didn't speak another word, and he just turned around and left.
After Su Ke left, Ye Xuan started to plunder the top-grade ores like a madman!
About two hours later, Ye Xuan had obtained six top-grade mineral veins and more than one million and three hundred thousand Divine Crystals of Fortune!
Over 1,300,000 Divine Fortune Crystals!
What sort of concept was that?
It could be said that even the entire Daoting and the Dao Tomb combined couldn't compare to his wealth!
Of course, he also plundered the experts' corpses. He buried the Sword Sect's experts' corpses properly, while the Dark Abyss' experts' corpses were also plundered. His harvest wasn't small at all. There were several tens of thousands of Divine Fortune Crystals and all kinds of treasures!
A huge windfall!
After plundering, Ye Xuan didn't choose to leave. Instead, he looked towards the depths of the Dark World.
There must be more top-grade ores in the depths of the Dark World!
Because he could already feel the dense spiritual energy there!
At this time, Ye Zhiming's voice suddenly sounded, "Don't be greedy!"
Ye Xuan nodded and turned to leave.
He was satisfied with his harvest today.
Right at this time, he stopped again.
Ye Zhiming asked, "What is it?"
Ye Xuan said solemnly, "Zhiming, I almost forgot something!"
Ye Zhiming asked, "What is it?"
Ye Xuan said softly, "I've already become a Dao Physique. Do you think my Dao Physique can resist the turbid qi?"
Ye Zhiming fell silent.
Ye Xuan suddenly smiled, "The Dao scripture is known as the number one body tempering technique, and the Dao Physique is known as the number one constitution. I'm curious, can the Dao Physique resist the turbid qi?"
Ye Zhiming said, "Why don't you give it a try?"
She was also curious!
This is a Dao scripture martial art!
Ye Xuan nodded and looked around. There were still some turbid qi drifting around the Sword Sect. His body trembled and he appeared in front of a strand of turbid qi, grabbing it with his right hand!
Ye Xuan stared at the strand of turbid qi. A moment later, he smiled!
Because nothing happened to his body at all!
The turbid qi had no effect on his Dao Physique!
Ye Xuan looked at the strand of turbid qi in his hand. As if he thought of something, he suddenly loosened his grip and allowed the turbid qi to enter his body!
Nothing happened to him after the turbid qi entered his body!
Ye Xuan slowly closed his eyes and said excitedly, "Zhiming, I have a great plan!"
Ye Zhiming asked, "What plan?"
The corner of Ye Xuan's lips curled up slightly. The next moment, he disappeared on the spot.
Not long later, Ye Xuan entered the depths of the Dark Realm.
When he arrived at the depths of the Dark Realm, Ye Xuan discovered that his surroundings were pitch-black and filled with turbid qi. The turbid qi here was extremely dense. Not to mention Dao Controlling experts, even Dao Attainment experts wouldn't dare to step into this place recklessly!
This time, Ye Xuan did not look for any top-grade mineral veins. Instead, he frantically absorbed the turbid qi. He used his body as a vessel and absorbed all the turbid qi into his body!
When it reached a certain level, Ye Xuan opened his palm and a sword quietly formed in his hand!
It was a sword condensed from turbid Qi!
Apart from that, tens of thousands of Qi swords suddenly appeared around him!
All of them were Qi swords formed from turbid qi!
Seeing this scene, Ye Xuan couldn't help but laugh.
His Dao body was immune to the turbid qi, but not everyone had a Dao body!
These ten thousand Qi swords formed from turbid qi were even more terrifying than the Soul Suppressing Sword!
Because these Qi swords would kill upon contact!
Ordinary experts wouldn't be able to withstand the turbid qi at all.
Once touched, they would immediately enter Heavenly Decay!
Ye Xuan didn't stop and continued to absorb the turbid qi. After absorbing it, he immediately condensed the turbid qi into swords!
Inside the Prison Pagoda, Ye Zhiming was silent as she watched Ye Xuan frantically condense swords.
The cause of misfortune?
She was starting to suspect that this was the cause of misfortune!
She was actually starting to sympathize with Daoting!
If this went on, Daoting would be toyed to death by Ye Xuan.
About four hours later, Ye Xuan absorbed all the turbid qi within hundreds of thousands of miles and condensed it into swords!
And now, he had a total of one hundred and twenty thousand swords!
All of them were condensed from turbid qi!
And with his current strength, forget about one hundred and twenty thousand swords, he could even control five hundred thousand swords!
Of course, the reason why he didn't do this before was because the sword qi was more refined than quantity. But it was different now. These swords were special!
It could be said that these swords formed from turbid qi didn't require much of his strength at all. These swords formed from turbid qi themselves carried a strange power!
He just needed to control these swords!
It was that simple!
Ye Xuan put away all of the swords and walked towards the depths of the Dark World.
However, he didn't walk for long when he suddenly stopped. He suddenly turned around. Not far in front of him, a powerful aura swept over.
Ye Xuan's brows furrowed slightly. Soon, a white figure appeared in front of him.
White Robe!
Seeing White Robe, Ye Xuan was expressionless. This Daoting really didn't give up!
White Robe glanced at the surroundings and frowned slightly. "Why isn't there any turbid qi here?"
Ye Xuan looked at White Robe and didn't speak.
White Robe looked at Ye Xuan. "You did it!"
Ye Xuan slowly clenched his right hand. At this moment, White Robe said again, "You can ignore the turbid qi!"
Ye Xuan didn't speak.
White Robe looked deeply at Ye Xuan. He didn't choose to attack but turned around and left.
Ye Xuan didn't choose to attack either because he wasn't confident that he could kill White Robe!
And he didn't want to expose this turbid qi now!
This would be a killer move that he would leave for Daoting!
On the spot, Ye Xuan was silent for a moment before he continued walking towards the depths of the Dark World.
He wanted to go to the deepest part to take a look!
The depths of the Dark World, which was also the depths of the Celestial Abyss, what exactly was there?
About an hour later, Ye Xuan's brows gradually furrowed because he felt an invisible pressure!
This pressure was like several mountains pressing down on him, making it difficult for him to breathe.
An hour later, Ye Xuan stopped in his tracks. He didn't dare to continue forward!
Because he felt that he couldn't breathe!
That pressure was too strong!
What exactly was in the depths of the Dark World?
Ye Xuan was silent for a moment before he turned around and left.
At this moment, a pitch-black hand suddenly landed on his shoulder!
Without a sound!
.....
..









Chapter 1390
Ye Xuan did not dare to move!
And that hand just rested on his shoulder!
Ye Xuan did not sense anyone behind him, and that was the most terrifying thing!
There was clearly someone, and the other party had a hand on his shoulder, but he could not sense the other party!
Who was it?
Ye Xuan turned around, but there was nothing in front of him!
There was nothing!
Ye Xuan fell silent.
In the next moment, Ye Xuan turned around and ran!
"Hehe …"
At this moment, a strange laughter suddenly sounded from all around him.
Ye Xuan stopped and glanced around, but he did not find anything.
After a moment of silence, Ye Xuan continued forward. At this moment, the space in front of him suddenly split open, and a face suddenly appeared in front of him!
It was the face of a little girl!
The little girl's face was as pale as a sheet, and her hair was disheveled, covering half of her face. At this moment, the little girl was staring at him with a sinister smile.
It had to be said that Ye Xuan was shocked!
Ye Xuan looked at the little girl in front of him and grinned.
Seeing Ye Xuan smile, the little girl was slightly taken aback. In the next moment, she grabbed Ye Xuan's throat, and a powerful force locked onto Ye Xuan.
The moment the little girl made a move, Ye Xuan's Soul Subduing Sword suddenly unsheathed!
Chi!
As a cutting sound rang out, the human face disappeared, and Ye Xuan retreated thousands of feet away!
As soon as Ye Xuan stopped, a little girl in white appeared in front of him.
The little girl in white looked at Ye Xuan and grinned. This smile was somewhat sinister. Immediately after, she was about to make a move, but at this moment, Ye Xuan suddenly took out a candied hawthorn.
The little girl looked at the candied hawthorn in Ye Xuan's hand and blinked.
Ye Xuan flicked his finger and the candied hawthorn landed in front of the little girl in white.
The white clothed little girl hesitated for a moment, and then she took the candied fruit and licked it lightly. In next to no time, her eyes lit up with disbelief!
Ye Xuan heaved a sigh of relief!
Actually, he was just trying it out because he realized that some of the younger ones seemed to like tanghulu!
Obviously, the little girl in front of him also liked tanghulu!
The little girl in white was indeed attracted by the candied hawthorn!
She licked with relish!
Ye Xuan sized up the little girl in white. This little girl's strength was not an ordinary kind of ferocious!
Because just now, this little girl had forcefully taken a blow from his sword and was completely fine!
Soon, the little girl finished eating the candied haws!
Ye Xuan quickly took out another stick of candied hawthorn and handed it to the little girl. The little girl in white looked at Ye Xuan. She took the candied hawthorn but did not say anything.
Ye Xuan smiled and asked, "What's your name?"
The white-clothed little girl didn't say anything.
Ye Xuan took out a stick of candied hawthorn and gave it to the white-clothed girl. The white-clothed girl took it and said, "Nagalou!"
Nagalou?
Ye Xuan frowned slightly. That name is a little strange!
The white-clothed little girl looked at Ye Xuan and didn't say anything.
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "Nagalou, what are you doing here?"
Nagalou didn't answer and just licked the candied hawthorn.
Ye Xuan hesitated for a moment and said, "Do you want to go out and play?"
Nagalou looked at Ye Xuan and said, "I can't go out!"
Ye Xuan was slightly puzzled. "Why?
I can even go out! "
Nagalou pointed to the right. Ye Xuan looked over, but there was nothing there.
Meanwhile, Nagalou suddenly walked over. The space in front of Nagalou suddenly split open a few hundred meters away, and then a huge golden word floated out.
Stop!
The golden word 'Stop' blocked Nagalou's path, and there was fear in Nagalou's eyes.
Ye Xuan looked at the word and said in a low voice, "Zhiming, do you know what this is?"
Ye Zhiming was silent for a moment, then said, "I've never seen it before!"
Ye Xuan walked over to Nagalou's side and looked at the golden word. It was obvious that someone had trapped Nagalou here.
Who could it be?
A single word had trapped the powerful Nagalou here!
Ye Xuan was silent for a moment, then he looked at Nagalou and said, "Why don't you enter my Xiao Ta?"
Nagalou pointed at Ye Xuan's abdomen. "Inside?"
Ye Xuan nodded.
Nagalou fell silent.
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "Give it a try?
What if I can get out? "
Nagalou thought about it, then nodded and entered the Prison Pagoda.
Inside the pagoda, Nagalou looked around curiously.
Outside, Ye Xuan looked at the giant golden word. He walked forward slowly. At this moment, the giant golden word suddenly erupted with a beam of golden light.
Ye Xuan's expression changed drastically, and he slashed with his sword.
Hiss!
A tearing sound resounded.
Bang!
An expanse of sword light suddenly erupted in the Dark Realm. In the next moment, Ye Xuan was instantly blasted back 30km away!
After he stopped, Ye Xuan's expression was extremely solemn!
He looked at the golden word. What the hell is this?
Suddenly, the golden word trembled violently as if it was about to attack again. Ye Xuan's expression changed drastically, and he suddenly leaped up and stabbed with his sword!
The Sword of the Way!
As he stabbed with his sword, the remaining Turbid Qi in the surroundings was instantly reduced to nothingness!
The Sword as the Way, the Way as the Sword!
This was the first time Ye Xuan had used the Sword of the Way!
At this moment, the golden word suddenly transformed into a ray of golden light and vanished.
A moment of silence.
Bang!
An expanse of golden light and sword light suddenly erupted in this expanse of space, and then a figure retreated repeatedly amidst the sword light and golden light!
It was Ye Xuan!
This time, Ye Xuan had retreated by an entire 30km!
However, the golden word had retreated by 3km as well!
Ye Xuan had just stopped moving when the space behind him exploded apart, and he even spat out a few mouthfuls of Blood Essence!
Ye Xuan wiped off the blood on the corners of his mouth, and then he gazed at the golden word. What the hell is this? It's actually so terrifying!
If his physical body wasn't sufficiently strong, then he would have probably been obliterated by that attack!
Meanwhile, Nagalou appeared by Ye Xuan's side. She gazed at Ye Xuan in silence.
Ye Xuan laughed bitterly, "I can't defeat him!"
Nagalou turned around and left.
Ye Xuan hesitated for a moment, and then he followed her.
Along the way, Nagalou didn't speak.
Ye Xuan smiled, "Nagalou, how long have you been here?"
Nagalou raised a finger.
Ye Xuan blinked, "10,000 years?"
Nagalou looked at Ye Xuan, "100,000 years!"
100,000 years!
Ye Xuan was stunned!
She had been here for 100,000 years!
What the hell?
This little girl had lived for 100,000 years?
At this time, Nagalou stopped, and Ye Xuan looked up. Not far away, there was a floating mountain. This mountain was 100,000 zhang tall, and there were some scattered floating rocks around it.
Ye Xuan followed Nagalou to the top of the mountain. When they arrived, Ye Xuan saw an old man.
The old man sat cross-legged on a boulder, his long hair draped over his shoulders, and his aura was as deep as the sea.
Ye Xuan's expression turned solemn!
There was a powerhouse here!
At this time, Nagalou walked to the old man's side, and she handed the candied hawthorn in her hand to the old man. The old man opened his eyes, glanced at the candied hawthorn in Nagalou's hand, and smiled, "You eat!"
Nagalou shook her head.
The old man smiled, took the candied hawthorn, and then looked at Ye Xuan in the distance, smiling, "Taoist Body!
How many years has it been since I last saw it! "
Taoist Body!
Hearing this, Ye Xuan's expression suddenly became extremely solemn.
Taoist Body was a part of the Taoist scripture martial arts, and in the words of Knowing Destiny, there were only two people who knew about the Taoist scripture martial arts, one was the owner of the Taoist scripture, and the other was her!
This old man in front of him actually knew about Taoist Body!
Could it be the owner of the Taoist scripture?
But it didn't seem like it!
Ye Xuan's mind was full of questions.
At this time, the old man smiled, "Young man, do you have many questions?"
Ye Xuan nodded, "How does Senior know about Taoist Body?"
The old man smiled, "Because someone has successfully cultivated it!"
Ye Xuan asked, "Who?"
The old man said softly, "It was a very, very long time ago!"
Ye Xuan glanced at the old man, "Who are you, Senior?"
The old man looked at Ye Xuan, "Young man, do you believe in fate?"
Ye Xuan was silent.
Damn, this old man is trying to fool me!
The old man smiled, "I believe in fate, and to be able to meet you today, it is enough to prove that we are fated."
Ye Xuan smiled, "With Senior's strength, you should be able to see the cause of my misfortune, right?"
The old man was silent.
Ye Xuan said, "Senior, if there is anything you want to say, you can say it directly!"
The old man said softly, "Young man, you are a straightforward person, so I will say it directly!
To be honest, I want you to do me a favor! "
Ye Xuan did not say anything.
He did not dare to casually agree to someone else's request. This old man was unfathomable, and the other party was actually trapped here. One could imagine how strong the person who trapped them was!
The old man looked at Ye Xuan, "Young man, can you help me bring my granddaughter out?"
Jia Lou!
Ye Xuan looked at Jia Lou. Jia Lou licked his tanghulu and did not say anything.
The old man said again, "Young man, over the years, there have been some people who have come here, but I did not ask them for help. I did not intend to ask you for help, because the karma between my granddaughter and me is not something an ordinary person can bear!"
Ye Xuan frowned, "You think I can bear it?"
The old man looked at Ye Xuan, "You have the cause of misfortune, but you still lived until now. Young man, do you know how terrifying that is?"
Ye Xuan was silent.
The old man said again, "Young man, I do not know your background, but I know that it is not simple!"
Ye Xuan looked at Jia Lou and said with a smile, "Senior, the person who can trap you must have strength that I cannot resist, right?"
The old man nodded, "It is not someone you can resist!
However, this is a grudge between me and him. My granddaughter is innocent, so I want to ask you for a favor and bring her out. "
Ye Xuan did not say anything.
The old man looked at Ye Xuan, "I do not have any benefits for you. On the contrary, if you save my granddaughter, it is very likely that you will be tainted with some bad karma, and this karma will bring you great trouble in the future!"
Ye Xuan said with a smile, "Then Senior, do you think I will save her?"
The old man said with a smile, "You will!"
Ye Xuan did not understand, "Why?"
The old man smiled slightly, "Because you are a good person!"
Ye Xuan was struck dumb. Then he shook his head. "Sir, I have a lot of friends behind me. Anything I say or do can bring disaster to them. So, do you understand what I mean?"
The old man was silent.
Ye Xuan said, "If I am alone, I will save her, but I have a universe behind me, so I am sorry!"
After saying that, he turned around and left.
Be a good person?
He really did not mind doing good things, but the premise was that he had the strength!
Taking care of things that were not within one's ability would not only bring disaster to oneself, but also to the entire Five-Dimensional Universe.
Doing good things, he had to act within his ability!
If he did not have the ability, then he really should not meddle in other people's business.
Moreover, he did not know the ins and outs of the matter!
Who knew whether this old man deserved it or not?
.....









Chapter 1391
The old man sighed softly when he saw Ye Xuan leave decisively.
Ye Xuan still didn't stop.
At this moment, the old man suddenly appeared before Ye Xuan. Ye Xuan held the sword tightly in his right hand and didn't speak, but he was secretly on guard.
The old man smiled, "Young friend, perhaps we can talk in a different way!"
Ye Xuan looked at the old man, "Feel free to bluff me, Senior!"
The old man laughed, "Young friend, you're interesting!"
Ye Xuan didn't speak.
The old man sized up Ye Xuan and smiled, "Young friend, I saw that your Dao Form has just reached the Dao Validation Realm, right?"
Ye Xuan nodded, "Yes!"
The old man smiled, "Do you want to reach the Dao Defense Realm?"
The Dao Defense Realm!
Ye Xuan was stunned, and then he said, "Are you serious?"
The old man nodded, "Yes!"
Ye Xuan fell silent.
The old man continued, "Young friend, there will be trouble if you save my granddaughter, but this trouble is in the future. Since it's in the future, then there are many uncertain factors.
At that time, it might seem troublesome now, but it might be a trivial matter to you.
To put it simply, whether the trouble in the future is big or small, or no trouble at all, it all depends on your strength in the future! "
[New]
Ye Xuan looked at the old man in confusion, "Who are you people!?"
The old man smiled, "The Dragon Horde, the most ancient Dragon Horde."
Dragon!
Ye Xuan couldn't help but glance at Jialou in the distance. No wonder this little girl's defense is so abnormal!
So it's a dragon!
The old man continued, "Young friend, if you're willing to help, this Old Man can not only help you reach the Dao Defense Realm, but he can also pass on everything to you from the Dragon Horde.
Of course, this old man won't bluff you. Forming good karma with the Dragon Horde is equivalent to forming bad karma with others.
However, Little Friend should also understand that since ancient times, fortune and misfortune come hand in hand. There are gains and losses. It all depends on Little Friend's choice! "
Ye Xuan looked at the old man. "Didn't you say that you wouldn't give me any benefits?"
The old man smiled and said, "It's just a test!"
Ye Xuan asked, "What's there to test?
Do you think I'm a good person? "
The old man smiled and said, "Little friend, you are neither good nor evil. You are not a pure good person, nor are you a pure evil person."
After a moment of silence, Ye Xuan asked, "What level has Senior reached?"
The old man thought for a moment and said, "Do you really want to know?"
Ye Xuan nodded.
The old man smiled and said, "Two or three realms higher than you, little friend!"
Above achieving the Dao!
Ye Xuan asked softly, "Senior, what is above achieving Dao?"
The old man smiled and said, "You will know in the future!"
Ye Xuan was speechless. "Can't I know in advance?"
The old man shook his head. "It's meaningless. Don't ask about meaningless things!"
Ye Xuan was about to speak when the old man said, "Little friend, let me discuss my specific conditions with you!
If you are willing to help, then not only will I help your Dao Body attain the Dao Defense Realm, I will even give you the wealth of the Jia Long Tribe. Moreover, the Jia Long Tribe has 12 Dragon Souls. Even though they are only souls, they are all at the peak of the Dao Defense Realm. Moreover, they are not ordinary peak Dao Defense Realm experts. Ordinary experts at the Dao Defense Realm are utterly unable to resist them! "
12 Dragon Souls!
All at the peak of the Dao Defense Realm!
Ye Xuan was slightly tempted.
At this time, the old man added, "As for wealth, all the top-grade mines in the Heavenly World Abyss belong to my Dragon Tribe. As long as little friend agrees, I will gift all the top-grade mines to little friend, as well as some of my Dragon Tribe's treasures. Everything will belong to little friend."
Ye Xuan hesitated for a moment before he said, "Senior … this …"
The old man continued, "There are over 30 top-grade spirit veins in the depths of the Dark World, and every single one of them contains at least a million Divine Fortune Crystals …"
Ye Xuan suddenly said seriously, "I'll do it!"
The old man looked at Ye Xuan, "Won't you think about it?"
Ye Xuan hurriedly shook his head, "There's no need to think about it!"
The old man smiled, "You know how strong I am. Just think about it, how terrifying is the person who can trap me?
Are you really not going to think about it? "
Ye Xuan chuckled, "I really want to think about the future!
However, my top priority now is to think about the present! "
Would the Daoting let him go?
Of course not!
As for the Dao Tomb, he would not place his hopes on it at all.
As long as there were enough benefits, the Dao Tomb would abandon him at any time!
As if thinking of something, Ye Xuan said solemnly, "Senior, there's a large golden word outside …"
The old man smiled, "I'll take care of that!"
Ye Xuan nodded, "Then there's no problem!"
The old man said, "Come with me!"
After saying that, he walked into the distance.
Ye Xuan and Jialou followed. Soon, the old man brought Ye Xuan and Jialou to a well.
Ye Xuan glanced at the well. It was not water in the well, but blood!
It was full of blood!
The blood was boiling like magma!
The old man said softly, "When my Dragon Horde was massacred, I preserved the blood of my Dragon Horde."
After saying that, he looked at Ye Xuan, "Go down!"
Ye Xuan said solemnly, "Absorb?"
The old man smiled, "No, go down and use the Dragon Blood to temper your body. My Dragon Horde's blood is extremely Yang and tyrannical. It has a miraculous effect on the tempering of the body!
This much Dragon Blood is enough to improve your Daoist Physique to the next level!
Not only that, but it will also give you the power of the Dragon Blood! "
Ye Xuan glanced at the Dragon Blood and jumped into the well without hesitation.
Boom!
In an instant, Ye Xuan's eyes widened.
Burn!
At this moment, Ye Xuan felt his body burning!
The power of the Dragon Blood!
This well contained almost all the Dragon Blood of the Jia Dragon Horde. This Dragon Blood was so powerful that ordinary Dao Defense Realm cultivators would immediately be reduced to ashes if they entered!
Only Ye Xuan's Daoist Physique could withstand the power of so much Dragon Blood. If it was an ordinary person, they would probably be burned to ashes the moment they came into contact with the Dragon Blood!
At this moment, the blood in Ye Xuan's body suddenly surged!
Boom!
In an instant, Ye Xuan began to absorb the Dragon Blood around him!
He was devouring!
The old man watched quietly from the side. He did not stop him, and his expression was calm as if he had already expected this.
Beside the old man, Jialou was still quietly licking his candied fruit, not saying a word.
Meanwhile, the old man suddenly grabbed Jialou's hand and spoke softly, "Little girl, follow him later, alright?"
Jialou shook her head.
The old man looked at Jialou and smiled, "Little girl, you're the last hope of the Dragon Horde. Grandpa didn't want you to carry this burden, but you have no choice!
Look at the Dragon Horde. 136 Dragons were skinned and their tendons skinned …. We living dragons can't forget this blood feud!
Grandpa isn't capable enough to avenge our clansmen. Only you can avenge them! "
Jialou remained silent.
The old man looked at the well and spoke softly, "You must follow him. Only by following him will you have a chance to avenge the Dragon Horde!
Besides that, little girl, it's time for you to go out and see the outside world! "
Jialou still remained silent.
The old man looked at Ye Xuan in the well. "This person has the Disaster Seed and has cultivated a Dao Body. He's not simple, especially his bloodline power. His bloodline power is even stronger than our Jia Dragon Tribe's … I have to say that it's terrifying for a human's bloodline to reach such a level!
However, because of the Disaster Seed, his troubles may be endless.
Little girl, you must be careful when you follow him. Just because he's tough doesn't mean the lives of those around him are tough! "
Jialou still remained silent.
The old man looked at Jialou with a complicated expression. "Little girl, if you can take revenge in the future, do so. If you can't, then don't. Remember, staying alive is the most important thing. You must live well!"
Jialou looked at the old man. "Let's go together!"
The old man smiled and was about to speak when the well in the distance suddenly exploded and Ye Xuan floated out. At that moment, Ye Xuan's body exuded an extremely powerful aura. His body was red as if it was condensed from fresh blood.
Dragon Blood!
He had absorbed all the Dragon Blood!
Now, his Dao Body had reached the Dao Imperial Realm!
Ye Xuan opened his eyes and clenched his fists. In an instant, the space around him split apart!
A trace of excitement flashed in Ye Xuan's eyes. After he had devoured the Dragon Blood, his Dao Body had not only reached the Dao Imperial Realm, but he had also obtained the bloodline power of the Dragon Tribe. The characteristic of the bloodline power of the Dragon Tribe was power!
Unparalleled power!
He could now easily kill a Dao Imperial Realm expert with the power of his physical body!
With the strength of his current physical body, he would not be afraid even if he faced experts at the level of Zhen Wu and White Robe.
He could go head-on against experts at the level of White Robe and Zhen Wu!
The improvement this time was far too great!
Ye Xuan withdrew his thoughts and looked at the old man in the distance. He cupped his fists and said, "Thank you!"
The old man smiled and said, "Congratulations, young friend!"
Ye Xuan spoke in a low voice, "Senior, was this Heaven Abyss once the territory of the Dragon Tribe?"
The old man nodded, "This place used to be the territory of the Dragon Tribe. Later on, a great battle occurred here, so it became an abyss!
The mineral veins in this abyss all belong to the Dragon Tribe. "
Ye Xuan spoke softly, "I see!"
Meanwhile, the old man withdrew a Spatial Ring, "This Spatial Ring contains all the treasures and mineral veins of the Dragon Tribe. It can be said that all the wealth of the Dragon Tribe is in here. Now, I'll give it to you!"
However, Ye Xuan did not take it.
The old man smiled, "Young friend, are you going back on your word?"
Ye Xuan spoke in a low voice, "Senior, aren't you afraid of entrusting it to the wrong person?"
The old man roared with laughter, "Young friend, I believe in your character!"
Ye Xuan shook his head and smiled, "To be honest, even I don't really believe in my character!"
The old man smiled, "Young friend, I'll be honest with you as well. Besides you, I have no one else to choose from!"
Ye Xuan fell silent.
The old man looked at Jia Lou who was beside him, "Young friend, this granddaughter of mine has been here for too long and is slightly introverted. However, her nature is not bad. After she leaves with you, I hope you treat her well!"
Ye Xuan glanced at Jia Lou, "Don't worry, Senior. I, Ye Xuan, will take good care of Miss Jia Lou after I've benefited from you."
The old man spoke softly, "This old man can rest assured!"
As he spoke, he spread open his hands. In an instant, his body started to crack inch by inch. At the same time, an extremely overbearing aura suddenly appeared on the mountain peak.
In next to no time, an enormous dragon that was over 100km long appeared on the mountain peak!
In front of this enormous dragon, the mountain beneath Ye Xuan's feet was like a speck of dust!
Ye Xuan was shocked!
He had never seen such an enormous dragon before!
Compared to this dragon, the so-called True Dragons in the past were like earthworms!
At this moment, the enormous dragon suddenly raised its head and roared angrily. In an instant, the entire Celestial Abyss shook violently. At this moment, whether it was the Daoting World or the Dao Tomb, everyone was shocked!
In the sky above the mountain peak, the enormous dragon raised its head and looked into the distance, laughing loudly, "Girl, remember well. Even if there is only one dragon left in my Dragon Clan, we must still live with our backs straight. We can die, we can be exterminated, but our Dragon Clan's courage and pride cannot be lost.
Even if we die, we must die standing. "
"Is that so?"
At this moment, an ancient voice suddenly sounded from afar. This voice seemed to come from ancient times, and it was illusory.
At almost the same time, somewhere in the distant starry sky, a woman in a plain dress suddenly stopped in her tracks.
The woman in the plain dress just stood there silently, not saying a word.
As the ancient voice sounded from the depths of the Celestial Abyss, a huge golden word suddenly appeared before the enormous dragon, and a faint shadow could be seen within the golden word.
The golden word transformed into a golden ray of light that shot explosively towards the enormous dragon.
In the sky, the enormous dragon suddenly raised its head and roared, and then it directly collided with the golden ray of light.
Boom!
This collision caused the entire Celestial Abyss to shake violently like a huge earthquake!
In the sky, the enormous dragon had just come into contact with the golden word, and then the enormous dragon actually started to crumble inch by inch!
When he saw this, Ye Xuan's expression instantly changed!
Such a powerful dragon actually couldn't defeat this word?
Ye Xuan was extremely shocked!
At this moment, the old man's pained voice suddenly resounded in the sky, "Take her and leave!"
Ye Xuan didn't waste any time, and he directly pulled Jialou who was beside him and ran madly towards the distance.
At this moment, the enormous dragon had already turned into ashes ….
A super expert above the Dao Attainment Realm had been instantly killed just like that!
His soul had been completely destroyed!
Ye Xuan was extremely shocked. Damn, this was too frightening!
Hurry up and run!
Ye Xuan pulled Jialou and quickened their pace!
At this moment, Ye Xuan and Jialou suddenly stopped, because the huge golden word had appeared in front of them.
Within the huge golden word, a faint shadow could be seen.
Ye Xuan looked at this shadow with an extremely solemn expression.
Beside Ye Xuan, Jialou stared at the shadow. Two streams of clear liquid had appeared on her cheeks, and her eyes were filled with undisguised killing intent.
The huge golden word suddenly trembled slightly, as if it was about to attack. At this moment, somewhere in the distant starry sky, the woman in the plain dress suddenly turned her head and glanced at it. "Attack him?
You can try! "
.....
PS: Tickets, tickets ….









Chapter 1392
As soon as she said this, the golden word in front of Ye Xuan and Jialou stopped moving.
Ye Xuan was stunned.
The woman in the plain dress continued to walk into the distance.
At this moment, a voice resounded from the starry sky behind her. "Who are you!?"
In the distance, the woman in the plain dress didn't even turn around. "Someone you can't afford to offend!"
Someone you can't afford to offend!
The starry sky suddenly became quiet!
...
Heaven Abyss, Dark World.
The golden word in front of Ye Xuan suddenly became illusory, and then it gradually disappeared completely.
Ye Xuan and Jialou were stunned.
Gone?
Ye Xuan lifted his head to take a look. He said softly, "Is that you, Qing'er?"
There was no response.
Ye Xuan was silent for a moment, and then he left with Jialou.
Jialou didn't speak along the way.
Ye Xuan glanced at Jialou and said, "Miss Jialou, why don't you come to my tower first?"
Jialou nodded and disappeared on the spot.
Ye Xuan looked around. He had to admit that he had gained a lot this time!
Very much!
The treasures he had obtained from the Naga Dragon Clan were enough to change the fate of the entire Fifth Dimension!
Truly change the fate of the Fifth Dimension!
There were a total of 36 top-grade mineral veins in the spatial ring the old man had given him. In addition to the ones he had obtained before, he now had a total of 40 top-grade mineral veins!
And he had tens of millions of Divine Fortune Crystals!
Tens of millions!
What did that mean?
It could be said that the total wealth of the Daoting and the Dao Tomb couldn't compare to Ye Xuan!
With these Divine Fortune Crystals, he could cultivate a large number of Dao Proving Realm experts, and even Dao Controlling Realm experts!
Of course, what he needed the most now was time!
The complete rise of the Fifth Dimension was only a matter of time!
Apart from that, he had also gained a lot this time. He now had over a hundred thousand energy swords, and all of them were condensed from turbid Qi. Even an ordinary Dao Defense Realm expert would find it difficult to resist the turbid Qi!
This was the gift he had prepared for the Daoting!
Of course, the biggest gain was the improvement of his Taoist Body!
With his current body, he could fight against a top expert like True Martial God!
It could be said that if it was a one-on-one battle, the only ones who could pose a fatal threat to him were experts of the Dao Realm!
In addition, he had also obtained the treasures of the Naga Dragons!
The treasures of the Dragon Clan were truly terrifying …
In short, the harvest this time was bountiful!
Of course, he didn't get too excited. Now, he had to face a problem, and that was how to explain everything that had happened in the Dark World!
However, this was not a problem for him!
After a while, Ye Xuan left the black vortex.
As soon as he appeared outside the vortex, Rahu and the others appeared in front of him.
Luo Hou glanced at Ye Xuan. "Let's talk somewhere else!"
After saying that, everyone disappeared.
...
Heavenly King Palace.
Apart from Luo Hou, Chi Yaoyao, Bitter King, and Barbarian King were also in the hall.
At this moment, everyone was looking at Ye Xuan.
Ye Xuan smiled. "Everyone must be very curious about what happened in the vortex!"
Luo Hou nodded. "Tell us!"
Ye Xuan told them about the Sword Sect, but he didn't say anything about Jialou and the old man.
In any case, it was half the truth and half a lie!
After a while, Luo Hou suddenly asked, "That's it?"
Ye Xuan nodded. "That's it!" Luo Hou looked at Ye Xuan. "You didn't know that something big happened in the Dark World?"
Ye Xuan said, "I know, but it came from the depths of the Dark World. I didn't go there, so I don't know what happened there either!"
At this moment, Bitter King suddenly said, "You really don't know, or you don't want to say?"
Ye Xuan looked at Bitter King and smiled. "Bitter King, you really think highly of me!
How could I go to the depths of the Dark World? "
Bitter King gazed at Ye Xuan and didn't speak.
Meanwhile, Luo Hou suddenly said, "Did you get anything?"
Ye Xuan nodded. "I brought six top-grade ores from the Sword Sect Ruins!"
As soon as he finished speaking, he withdrew a spatial ring and passed it to Luo Hou, "I'll take three!"
Luo Hou glanced at Ye Xuan and put the spatial ring away.
Meanwhile, Zhan Man spoke abruptly, "What right do you have to take three?"
Ye Xuan replied, "I risked my life for them!"
Zhan Man gazed at Ye Xuan, "Without us to stop the Daoting, you wouldn't have been able to enter!"
Ye Xuan ignored Zhan Man and looked at Luo Hou instead. Luo Hou remained silent.
Ye Xuan smiled. "It's fine!
They're all yours!
I don't want any of them! "
As soon as he finished speaking, he placed a spatial ring in front of Luo Hou.
Inside the spatial ring were three top-grade ores!
After putting down the spatial ring, Ye Xuan turned around and left.
Zhan Man King frowned. "Wait!"
Ye Xuan turned around to look at Zhan Man King. Zhan Man King King King stared at Ye Xuan, "I suspect there are more than six!"
Ye Xuan laughed. "Zhan Man King, are you an idiot?"
Zhan Man King King King narrowed his eyes and punched out!
In the distance, Ye Xuan slashed down with his sword.
Bang!
An explosion suddenly resounded in the hall. Ye Xuan retreated a dozen steps while Zhan Man King King King returned to his original position!
Luo Hou and Bitter King looked at Ye Xuan with a trace of shock in their eyes!
Ye Xuan's strength has become so strong?
Qing Yaoyao sipped her tea slowly and didn't speak at all.
Zhan Man King King was about to attack again when Ye Xuan suddenly said, "Zhan Man King, you can attack if you want, but it's pointless to stop now. How about this? I challenge you to a life and death duel, and I won't stop until one of us dies!
Just the two of us, and we'll have a fair fight. The one who asks for help is a dog. What do you think? "
Luo Hou frowned as well. Zhan Man King gazed at Ye Xuan and smiled, "Do you think I'm afraid of you?
You …. "
Meanwhile, Qing Yaoyao spoke abruptly, "Zhan Man, do you want to die?"
Everyone gazed at Qing Yaoyao when they heard this.
Zhan Man gazed at her with a gloomy expression, "What're you trying to say?"
Qing Yaoyao shrugged, "Then have a life and death duel!"
Zhan Man King frowned, "Divine King, do you think I can't defeat him?"
Qing Yaoyao smiled, "Zhan Man, let's not talk about whether you can defeat him or not. Let's talk about whether your life and death duel is meaningful!
Who would be the happiest if the two of you fought to the death?
Daoting! "
As she spoke, she gazed at Ye Xuan, "Don't you think so?"
Ye Xuan said with a smile, "But I still want to fight him!"
Qing Yaoyao gazed at Ye Xuan, "Are you sure?"
She was slightly displeased.
Ye Xuan looked Qing Yaoyao in the eyes, "I'm sure!"
As soon as these words were spoken, the temperature in the surroundings suddenly dropped.
Meanwhile, Zhan Man King stood up, but Luo Hou stopped him.
Zhan Man King was about to speak when Luo Hou's voice suddenly resounded in his mind, "You have to think this through. He's full of tricks and never does anything that puts him at a disadvantage. Moreover, he's ruthless. He definitely has something to rely on since he dared to challenge you, and it's very likely that even we can't stop him.
Even if we can stop him, your entire reputation will be destroyed if you lose to him! "
Zhan Man King fell silent.
At this moment, Qian Yaoyao suddenly opened her palm, and a storage ring flew into her hand in front of Luo Hou. She handed the storage ring to Ye Xuan. "You deserve this!"
Ye Xuan put the spatial ring away, turned around, and left.
After Ye Xuan left, Zhan Man King said fiercely, "He's too arrogant!
If it wasn't for our Dao Tomb, he would have already been Daoting … "
"Idiot!"
Chi Yaoyao suddenly turned around and glanced coldly at Zhan Man.
Zhan Man King's expression instantly turned ferocious, and he was just about to stand up when Luo Hou suddenly said, "Sit down!"
His voice was icy cold, and it didn't contain a trace of emotion!
Zhan Man King said in a low voice, "Luo Hou, are you really going to let him do this?"
Luo Hou looked at Qing Yaoyao, "Speak!"
Qing Yaoyao sat down with an expressionless face, "We've always taken the initiative in our cooperation with him, but I'm afraid that's no longer the case now!"
Luo Hou frowned, "What do you mean?"
Qing Yaoyao said softly, "Let me ask everyone a question, does he really need our Dao Tomb?"
Zhan Man King said coldly, "Doesn't he need it?"
Qing Yaoyao looked at Zhan Man, "Can you use your brain a little?"
Zhan Man King said angrily, "You …"
Luo Hou suddenly said, "If you interrupt again, get out!"
In the Dao Tomb, Chi Yaoyao had always been the brains of the Dao Tomb. Even when the Lord was here, he was extremely respectful to Chi Yaoyao, and would discuss all major matters with her.
Zhan Man King's expression was a little ugly, but he didn't interrupt again.
Chi Yaoyao said, "Actually, he doesn't need us!
I've investigated before, he went to Daoting after Mu Niannian's death, and he slaughtered countless Daoting experts at that time. He even proved his Dao by killing. In the end, the Dao Ancestor had no choice but to intervene, but he's still alive!
Why?
Because his younger sister stopped the Dao Ancestor!
In other words, Ye Ling!
And there's an extremely powerful soul within Ye Ling's body! "
Luo Hou and the others fell silent.
Chi Yaoyao said again, "What does that mean?
It means that that person's strength isn't inferior to the Dao Ancestor's!
Also, you seem to have forgotten that he's someone with the Calamity Seed. This Calamity Seed only exists in the legends. Of course, that's not the point. The point is that he's still alive. "
As she spoke, she glanced at the crowd, "I've done an investigation recently, and I've investigated everything about him. Do you know what I found?"
Luo Hou said solemnly, "Speak!"
Chi Yaoyao smiled, "He's not someone we can afford to offend!"
Luo Hou frowned slightly, "A little exaggerated?"
Chi Yaoyao shook her head, "It's not exaggerated at all!
We all think that Mu Niannian is his greatest backer, but in my opinion, that Miss Nian Nian isn't his greatest backer.
The source of his bloodline is that woman in a plain dress!
And we know almost nothing about these two people.
Even with our strength, we can't investigate them. If you think about this problem, you'll realize how terrifying it is!
Besides that, there's definitely someone who's helping him resist the Calamity Seed. Otherwise, with his strength, he would absolutely be unable to survive until now!
As for this Cause of Disaster, let alone resisting it, we don't even know what the hell this Cause of Disaster is! "
The Calamity Seed!
What exactly is it?
Actually, many people don't know!
They only know that it's a form of karma!
But exactly what kind of karma is it?
No one knows!
Chi Yaoyao continued, "He's immune to sword qi!
As for the Sword Sect's sword qi, all of you've experienced it, so you know how terrifying it is!
But he's immune to it! "
As she spoke, she looked at Zhan Man, "If I were him, I wouldn't absorb the sword qi. Instead, I'd gather it, and once I encounter an enemy, I'd release it. In any case, the sword qi would automatically attack others. How comfortable would that be!?"
Zhan Man's expression turned even more unsightly when he heard this.
...









Chapter 1393
Inside the hall, Luo Hou and the others had ugly expressions!
Chi Yaoyao stood up and left without another word.
In the starry sky, Ye Xuan suddenly stopped with a woman standing in front of him.
It was Qing Yaoyao!
Qing Yaoyao looked at Ye Xuan and smiled, "This isn't like you!"
Ye Xuan said, "About the hall?"
Qing Yaoyao nodded.
Ye Xuan smiled, "Miss Yaoyao, the Dao Tomb Grounds have never trusted me. No matter how many top grade ores I hand over, you still won't believe me, right?"
Qing Yaoyao fell silent.
Indeed!
No matter how much Ye Xuan handed over, the Dao Tomb Grounds would think it wasn't enough.
Qing Yaoyao looked at Ye Xuan and smiled, "Then how many top grade ores did you get?"
Ye Xuan looked at Qing Yaoyao, "Miss Yaoyao, are you asking me on behalf of the Dao Tomb Grounds or yourself?"
Qing Yaoyao blinked, "Is there a difference?"
Ye Xuan smiled, "There's a huge difference!"
How could Qing Yaoyao not understand Ye Xuan's meaning?
After a moment of silence, Qing Yaoyao said, "I won't ask anymore!"
Ye Xuan smiled, "Farewell!"
With that, he turned to leave.
At this moment, Qing Yaoyao suddenly said, "Can I still kill you now?"
Ye Xuan stopped and looked at Qing Yaoyao, "I'm afraid not!"
He couldn't!
Qing Yaoyao shook her head and smiled.
She knew that Ye Xuan must have had some fortuitous encounter in the Dark World.
Chi Yaoyao asked again, "Then can you kill me?"
Ye Xuan thought about it, "I can try!"
Qing Yaoyao looked at Ye Xuan, "You're so confident?"
Ye Xuan smiled, "I'm not very confident!"
Qing Yaoyao's lips curled, "Want to exchange a few moves?"
Ye Xuan shook his head. "Miss Yaoyao, my enemy is Daoting, not you, and not the Dao Tomb!
From the very beginning, I've never treated the Dao Tomb as an enemy. You should know this very well!
However, the Dao Tomb doesn't think so. What do you think? "
After a long period of silence, Qing Yaoyao asked, "Will we become enemies in the future?"
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "That will depend on what the Dao Tomb Ground does!"
Qian Yaoyao looked at Ye Xuan without saying anything.
Ye Xuan suddenly smiled and said, "Miss Yaoyao, have you ever thought of changing places?"
Qian Yaoyao was taken aback for a moment before she smiled and said, "You want to rope me in?"
Ye Xuan nodded. "The Fifth Dimension is a good place. Are you interested in going there?"
Qian Yaoyao smiled and said, "I'm very curious, what benefits are you going to use to win me over?"
Ye Xuan pondered for a moment before he asked, "What does Miss Yaoyao want?"
Qian Yaoyao asked back, "What do you think I want?"
Ye Xuan looked at Qian Yaoyao and said, "You want to destroy the Daoting, the so-called Great Dao, because the Great Dao is unfair.
But now, the Dao Tomb Ground's goal is not Daoting. Miss Yaoyao, forgive me for being blunt, but even if the Dao Tomb Ground destroys the Daoting, the world will still be unfair because the Dao Tomb Ground will be the next Daoting!
Miss Yaoyao, you should understand that the Dao Tomb Ground is no longer fighting for their beliefs, but for themselves. "
Qian Yaoyao was silent.
Ye Xuan said again, "Miss Yaoyao, you should have investigated the Fifth Dimension. What do you think of it now?"
Qian Yaoyao smiled and said, "Very good!"
Ye Xuan looked at Qian Yaoyao and said, "I want to destroy the Daoting and rebuild the Great Dao of Order."
Qian Yaoyao looked straight at Ye Xuan and said, "Will you not become the next Daoting?"
Ye Xuan shook his head and said, "I won't!"
Qian Yaoyao smiled and said, "Why should I?"
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "Miss Yaoyao, you understand!"
With that, he turned and left.
Qian Yaoyao was silent.
She naturally understood.
Why did Ye Xuan want to destroy the Daoting?
Revenge!
Revenge for Mu Niannian!
What was Ye Xuan's ultimate goal?
To protect the Fifth Dimension!
Ye Xuan didn't care about the Dao Scripture, power, or longevity.
Or in other words, in his heart, the Dao Scripture, power, longevity, and invincibility were not the most important.
To him, friends, family, and the Fifth Dimension were more important!
Ye Xuan always knew what he wanted to do and what he wanted to fight for. But the Dao Tomb Ground was no longer fighting for the beliefs of the past!
What did the Dao Breakers in the Dao Tomb Ground believe in?
Fairness!
Why did they resist the Daoting?
Because the Great Dao was unfair!
However, when they had great strength, would they fight for this so-called fairness for more people?
No!
Because there was no difference between them and the Daoting itself!
Everyone was fighting for themselves!
This was why no one in the Dao Tomb Ground was able to forge a new path!
In the past, the Daoting was about proving one's Dao, while the Dao Tomb Ground was about breaking one's Dao. But now, above breaking one's Dao was controlling one's Dao and achieving one's Dao. In other words, the Dao Tomb Ground and the Daoting path were the same!
With this thought, Qian Yaoyao sighed and turned to leave.
...
Daoting.
In the main hall of the Divine Palace, Bai Dizi and the others had ugly expressions on their faces.
In the Dark World, White Robe did not attack Ye Xuan because he discovered that Ye Xuan could ignore the turbid qi.
Moreover, such a huge commotion in the Dark World was definitely related to Ye Xuan!
What happened in the Dark World?
This was what they wanted to know the most!
At this moment, Bai Dizi said softly, "Things are getting worse for us!"
They really wanted to kill Ye Xuan and used all their strength, but Ye Xuan was still alive and well.
Now, Ye Xuan was growing every day, and they could only watch Ye Xuan grow.
It had to be said that this was a kind of torture for them.
And now, even if they wanted to stop and make peace, it was impossible because Ye Xuan would never stop and make peace!
It could be said that between the Daoting and Ye Xuan, only one could survive.
At this moment, Bai Dizi suddenly said, "Wait!"
White Robe and the True Martial Divine Lord looked at Bai Dizi, and Bai Dizi slowly closed his eyes. "Wait for the Dao Ancestor to come out of seclusion!"
Come out of seclusion!
Now, only when the Dao Ancestor came out could they change the situation of the Daoting.
...
In the Fifth Dimension.
After Ye Xuan returned to the Fifth Dimension, he immediately called Guan Yin!
In the hall, Ye Xuan said solemnly, "Only Xiao Qi has reached Dao Validation?"
Guan Yin nodded. "An Lanxiu, Aro, and A 'Jiu are on the verge of breaking through, but it's still not enough … There aren't enough Fortune Divine Crystals!"
Fortune Divine Crystals!
Thinking of this, Guan Yin sighed softly.
At this moment, she realized how important the Fortune Divine Crystals were.
Not only were they useful to Dao Validation experts, but they were also useful to Self Release experts like her.
This world was like this. Without money, no matter how much effort you put in, it was useless!
At this moment, Ye Xuan suddenly took out a storage ring and handed it to Guan Yin. Guan Yin glanced at the storage ring, and the next moment, her expression changed drastically. "This …"
There were five million Fortune Divine Crystals in the storage ring!
Moreover, these Fortune Divine Crystals were several times purer than before!
Guan Yin looked at Ye Xuan and said with a trembling voice, "Where did you go to rob this time?"
Ye Xuan's face darkened. "What are you saying!?
What do you mean I went to rob again!? "
Guan Yin stared at Ye Xuan. "Where did you get them!?"
Ye Xuan said with a smile, "It's a long story, so I won't say much!
You can distribute these Fortune Divine Crystals! "
Guan Yin glanced at Ye Xuan and did not ask anymore. She picked up the storage ring and left.
In the hall, Ye Xuan slowly closed his eyes.
Fortune Divine Crystals!
He now had more than thirty-eight million Fortune Divine Crystals. After giving five million to Guan Yin, he still had thirty-three million left!
These Fortune Divine Crystals were enough to last the Fifth Dimension for a hundred years!
What he needed the most now was time!
It could be said that it was not impossible for the Fifth Dimension to surpass the Daoting and the Dao Tomb!
Inside the hall, Ye Xuan took out the Dao Scriptures.
He now had five Dao Scriptures!
He already knew that there was one in the Daoting, one in the Dao Tomb, and one in the Whirling World. What about the last one?
Ye Xuan suddenly asked, "Zhiming, do you know the whereabouts of the last Dao Scripture?"
Ye Zhiming said solemnly, "No!"
Ye Xuan slowly closed his eyes!
Dao Scriptures!
The Spirit of the Great Dao!
This was what Sister Nian told him before she died. He must find the Spirit of the Great Dao!
At this moment, Guan Yin suddenly ran into the hall. She looked at Ye Xuan and said excitedly, "Good news!"
Ye Xuan was stunned and asked, "Good news?"
Guan Yin nodded and said excitedly, "Many, many spirits came!"
Spirits!
Ye Xuan and Guan Yin disappeared from the hall.
Spirit Palace.
On this day, countless spirits came to the Spirit Palace. These spirits were the Spirits of Heaven and Earth that had been ordered by Xiao Ling'er to find spirits!
Now, these spirits had returned!
Not only did they return, but they also brought many spirits with them to the Fifth Dimension!
Every Spirit brought back a Spirit, some even brought back a few …
For a moment, the entire Spirit Palace became unusually lively!
Ye Xuan glanced at the entire Spirit Palace. There were more than 10,000 spirits!
There were all kinds of spirits!
And these spirits were surrounding Xiao Ling'er, and Xiao Ling'er was giving them Divine Crystals of Fortune!
At this moment, Xiao Ling'er suddenly looked up at Ye Xuan. The next moment, she flew directly in front of Ye Xuan, and all the spirits surrounded them. All the spirits were looking at Ye Xuan and Xiao Ling'er!
Xiao Ling'er grinned. "Brother, I want money!"
Ye Xuan laughed. He took out a storage ring and handed it to Xiao Ling'er. Xiao Ling'er glanced at it, and the next moment, her eyes widened. "Wow …"
As she said that, she gave Ye Xuan a big hug!
There were 300,000 Divine Crystals of Fortune in the storage ring!
The reason why he did not give more was because he was afraid that this little girl would waste it!
Xiao Ling'er began to give the spirits Divine Crystals of Fortune. She was very generous because she had doubled the reward!
Seeing that Xiao Ling'er had doubled the reward, the spirits were overjoyed. For a moment, the entire Spirit Palace was filled with chattering laughter …
At this moment, Guan Yin's expression suddenly changed. She looked at Ye Xuan. "She's gone!"
Ye Xuan frowned slightly. "Who?"
Guan Yin said with a trembling voice, "Miss Nian Nian!"
Ye Xuan directly disappeared. The next moment, he arrived in a starry sky, but that starry sky was empty!
Mu Niannian's main body was gone!
Ye Xuan was stunned.
.....
PS: Please …









Chapter 1394
Gone!
Ye Xuan stood in the starry sky, looking as if he had lost his soul.
At this time, Guan Yin appeared beside Ye Xuan, her expression extremely ugly.
Ye Xuan asked, "What happened?"
Guan Yin shook her head, "I don't know!"
At this time, an old man suddenly appeared beside Ye Xuan and Guan Yin. The old man bowed to them, "Greetings, Alliance Leader Ye!
Miss Guan! "
Ye Xuan looked at the old man, "What happened?"
The old man shook his head, "I don't know either!
Miss Nian's body was still there, but just now, her body disappeared! "
Ye Xuan slowly closed his eyes!
Sister Nian's body was taken away?
Who?
Daoting?
Thinking of this, Ye Xuan suddenly opened his eyes. At this time, Ye Zhiming suddenly said, "It can't be Daoting!"
Ye Xuan asked, "Why?"
Ye Zhiming said solemnly, "You need to calm down!"
Ye Xuan fell silent, clenching his fists.
Ye Zhiming continued, "Daoting bringing Mu Niannian's body is meaningless. Are they going to use her body to threaten you?
That's obviously impossible!
Moreover, with your current strength, if someone stepped into the Fifth Dimension, you would definitely be able to detect it, right? "
Ye Xuan slowly clenched his right fist!
Ye Zhiming was right. With his current strength, if someone stepped into the Fifth Dimension, he would be able to detect it immediately.
But just now, he did not sense any aura!
Who was it?
Ye Xuan swept his gaze across the starry sky, his eyes as cold as ice!
At this time, Source Spirit suddenly appeared. She looked at the empty starry sky in the distance, stunned, then looked at Ye Xuan, "It's gone!"
Ye Xuan nodded.
Source Spirit asked, "Daoting?"
Ye Xuan shook his head, "Doesn't seem like it!"
Saying this, he slowly closed his eyes.
Daoting?
The Dao Tomb?
But it didn't look like it!
There was no reason for the Dao Tomb. Although there was a reason for Daoting, what was Daoting doing with Sister Nian's body?
Was he going to use it to threaten him?
That was possible!
With that thought in mind, Ye Xuan opened his eyes, and in the next moment, he vanished on the spot.
Guan Yin's expression changed when she saw this. She wanted to stop Ye Xuan, but Ye Xuan had disappeared without a trace!
...
In the Abyss of the Heaven Realm, in front of the main hall of the Divine Palace, a sword light suddenly appeared.
Almost at the same time, a spear pierced through the air from within the palace.
Boom!
In the sky above the divine palace, a sword light exploded, and a man appeared above the divine palace!
The person who had arrived was precisely Ye Xuan!
When Ye Xuan appeared, Bai Dizi, True Martial God, and White Robe appeared as well.
Bai Dizi stared fixedly at Ye Xuan, "What are you trying to do!"
Ye Xuan looked at Bai Dizi, "Did you do it?"
Bai Dizi frowned slightly, "What do you mean we did it?"
Ye Xuan said fiercely, "Sister Nian's body is no longer here!
Did you Daoting do it! "
Mu Niannian's body!
Bai Dizi was stunned, and then he said, "The Fifth Dimension Tendo's body is gone?"
Ye Xuan stared fixedly at Ye Xuan, "Did you Daoting!"
Bai Dizi was about to speak when True Martial God suddenly said, "Ye Xuan, I did not Daoting do it!"
Ye Xuan looked at True Martial God, and True Martial God said solemnly, "Daoting and you are mortal enemies, but not to this extent!
Also, Mu Niannian is the strongest.
Although the Omnipotent Expert has already fallen, we still respect her very much. We would never do such a shameless thing! "
Ye Xuan's expression became fiercer, "If it wasn't you, who else could it be?"
True Martial God looked at Ye Xuan, "Ye Xuan, why do we want Mu Niannian's body?
Are we going to use it to threaten you?
If so, we can use it to threaten you now!
Also, Daoting is not as despicable as you think. Even if we wanted to kill you, we would not use such despicable means! "
As he spoke, he glanced at Bai Dizi.
Bai Dizi immediately said angrily, "Why are you looking at me?
I have never done such a thing, and I disdain to do it! "
True Martial God nodded, "Very well!"
He, Zhen Wu, would never do something like stealing someone's corpse.
In the distance, Ye Xuan slowly closed his eyes.
Not Daoting?
Could it be the Dao Tomb?
At this moment, Qing Yaoyao suddenly appeared next to Ye Xuan and looked at Ye Xuan, "It is not the Dao Tomb, I am sure of this!"
Not the Dao Tomb!
Ye Xuan was silent, his expression becoming more and more fierce.
Who could it be?
After a moment of silence, Ye Xuan suddenly turned and left.
In the field, Qing Yaoyao frowned. Mu Niannian's body was gone!
Who would steal Mu Niannian's body?
Why would they steal it?
Qing Yaoyao turned to look at Bai Dizi and the others, "It really wasn't you?"
True Martial God said solemnly, "Heavenly Monarch, I, Daoting, am not that despicable!
Besides, I, True Martial, respect an expert like Mu Niannian from the bottom of my heart. Why would I do such a despicable thing? "
Qing Yaoyao turned to look at Bai Dizi. Bai Dizi was expressionless, "What, am I that despicable?"
Qing Yaoyao said indifferently, "True Martial God is an expert and he has his pride, but you, Bai Dizi, don't have that. What immoral things can't you do?"
Bai Dizi said coldly, "Think whatever you want!"
Chi Yaoyao said nothing else and turned to leave.
In the field, True Martial God said solemnly, "Who would steal Mu Niannian's body?"
Bai Dizi said, "Daoting is the most suspicious, followed by the Dao Tomb!"
True Martial God looked at Bai Dizi. Bai Dizi said, "Although she is dead, her body is also a Five-Dimensional Tendo, and she is so strong. Her body must be useful …"
At this point, he said angrily, "Why are you looking at me like that?
I said it!
I didn't do it! "
At this time, White Robe suddenly said, "If it wasn't us, and not the Dao Tomb, then who could it be?"
The three fell into silence.
After a long time, Bai Dizi seemed to think of something and his pupils suddenly shrank, "Could it be …"
White Robe and True Martial God looked at Bai Dizi. Bai Dizi's face was pale, and he was a little frightened.
True Martial frowned, "Could it be what?"
Bai Dizi said with a trembling voice, "It is possible!
It is completely possible! "
At this point, he looked at True Martial and White Robe, "Wait for my news!"
After saying this, he turned around and disappeared.
True Martial and White Robe were dumbfounded.
...
Heavenly King Palace.
At this time, Luo Hou and the others were there!
They already knew that Mu Niannian's body in the Five-Dimensional Universe had disappeared.
Inside the palace, Luo Hou looked at Qian Yaoyao, "Do you think this was done by Daoting?"
Qian Yaoyao shook her head, "It doesn't seem like it!
Like what True Martial said, they are not that despicable!
Especially True Martial and White Robe, no matter what, they would not do anything to Mu Niannian's body!
That kind of powerhouse is respected by everyone! "
Luo Hou nodded!
Even he respected Mu Niannian from the bottom of his heart!
Powerhouses still had their pride, especially people like True Martial and White Robe. Therefore, he did not believe that White Robe and True Martial had done anything to Mu Niannian's body.
At this time, Bitter King suddenly said, "If it is not us, and not Daoting, then who could it be?
Or does this Ye Xuan have other enemies? "
In the palace, Qian Yaoyao was silent.
No one spoke either.
The palace sank into silence.
After an unknown amount of time, Qian Yaoyao's pupils suddenly shrank, "Could it be …"
In the palace, everyone looked at Qian Yaoyao!
Chi Yaoyao did not speak. She stood up and left. After leaving the palace, she disappeared without a trace. No one knew where she went.
In the palace, the three looked at each other.
....
In the starry sky, Ye Xuan just stood there, staring at the place where Mu Niannian's body had been.
Disappeared without a trace!
It was not the Dao Tomb, nor was it Daoting!
Then who could it be?
Ye Xuan's eyes were somewhat blank.
Who took Sister Nian's body away?
Ye Ling?
She had the ability to take Sister Nian's body away without a trace, but she would not do so!
Then who else could it be?
Could it be that Dark Abyss?
But that was not possible either!
He could not think of anyone else!
Just like that, Ye Xuan stood in the starry sky for a whole day and a night!
On this day, Ye Xuan had unknowingly arrived in Shaman City. He just walked on the streets, looking as if he had lost his soul.
Shaman City was bustling. There were stalls on both sides of the streets, and the sounds of people shouting could be heard.
At that moment, an angry voice suddenly came from Ye Xuan's right. "You thief, how dare you steal …"
Ye Xuan looked in the direction of the sound. Not far away, a fat man was whipping a beggar crazily with a wooden stick.
The beggar was curled up on the ground, hugging something tightly. He did not make a sound even though he was being whipped by the fat man.
The beggar's hair was long, messy, and dirty. His face could not be seen.
The fat man stepped on the beggar and scolded, "How dare you steal from me? Ptooey …"
As he spoke, he continued whipping the beggar with the wooden stick.
At that moment, Ye Xuan suddenly appeared before the fat man. When he saw Ye Xuan, a hint of wariness appeared in the fat man's eyes, because Ye Xuan's attire told him that he was not a normal person, and he even had a sword with him.
Ye Xuan crouched down before the beggar and gently pushed aside the beggar's messy hair. When he saw the beggar's face, he was instantly stunned.
It was a little girl!
But her face was very dirty, and there were even wounds on it.
The little girl was terrified. She hugged the thing in her hands tightly and her body trembled. "Don't … hit me … It hurts …"
Ye Xuan asked softly, "What's your name?"
The little girl cast a glance at Ye Xuan and lowered her head slightly. Her lips moved, but she did not say anything!
Ye Xuan said gently, "Don't be afraid, I won't hit you!"
The little girl lifted her head slightly. She cast a glance at Ye Xuan, but soon lowered her head and said in a voice as soft as a mosquito, "Nian … Nian … My name is Nian Nian …"
Hearing this, Ye Xuan instantly felt as if he had been struck by lightning. He was petrified on the spot.
In the little girl's arms was a fish that was still jumping …
The little girl hugged the fish tightly, and she was terrified.
.....









Chapter 1395
Nian Nian!
Ye Xuan looked at the little girl in front of him as if he had lost his soul!
Sister Nian?
This thought flashed through Ye Xuan's mind!
However, the little girl in front of him looked completely different from Sister Nian!
However, he felt that this little girl looked familiar. This was also the reason why he had stopped in his tracks!
At this moment, the fat man suddenly said, "Who are you!?"
As he spoke, he constantly tapped his palm with the wooden stick as if he was threatening her.
Ye Xuan was about to speak when the little girl suddenly hugged her knees and buried her head in them. She said with a trembling voice, "Don't … hit … me … It hurts …"
A ruthless glint flashed through the fat man's eyes. He was about to grab the little girl's hair when a sword suddenly pierced through his forehead!
Hiss!
Blood splattered!
The expressions of the people on the street changed drastically as they retreated.
Ye Xuan ignored everyone. He squatted in front of the little girl and said gently, "Don't worry, no one will hit you!"
The little girl seemed to be very afraid. She curled up into a ball, but she kept hugging her fish. Even when she was being beaten up badly, she didn't let go of the fish.
Ye Xuan felt his heart ache for some reason when he saw that the little girl was still very afraid. As if he had thought of something, he pressed his palm gently against the ground. In an instant, a ball of fire appeared on the ground!
Ye Xuan gently crooked his index finger, and a fish flew into his hand from a bucket in the distance. He cleaned the fish quickly and then started to grill it!
Soon, the fragrance of fish wafted through the air.
At this moment, the little girl raised her head slightly. When she saw the roasted fish in Ye Xuan's hand, she blinked, but she quickly buried her head in her lap.
Clearly, she was still very afraid!
Ye Xuan hurriedly took out some seasonings and placed them on the roasted fish. Soon, the roasted fish became even more fragrant!
The little girl would steal a glance at the roasted fish from time to time.
Ye Xuan handed the roasted fish to Nian Nian and said gently, "Here, this is for you!"
The little girl raised her head and looked at Ye Xuan. Her throat rolled, but she did not dare to take it.
Ye Xuan smiled and said gently, "Don't be afraid. With me around, no one will dare to hit you!"
After hesitating for a while, the little girl slowly reached for the grilled fish.
Ye Xuan tried his best to make his smile amiable!
He had never been so cautious before!
The little girl held onto the grilled fish and Ye Xuan immediately let go. The little girl's throat rolled and she was about to eat when Ye Xuan hurriedly said, "Be careful, it's hot!"
As he spoke, he quickly blew on the grilled fish.
The little girl glanced at Ye Xuan and took a bite. When the fish entered her mouth, she blinked and quickly took a few more bites.
At the side, Ye Xuan squatted down and looked at the little girl in front of her.
Is that Sister Nian?
Ye Xuan didn't know.
But he hoped so!
Soon, the little girl finished the grilled fish.
Ye Xuan blinked. "Do you want more?"
The little girl nodded.
Ye Xuan hurriedly continued grilling. Soon, he handed the grilled fish to the little girl. "Here!"
The little girl glanced at Ye Xuan. There was no longer any fear in her eyes!
The little girl took the grilled fish and seemed to have thought of something. She tore off a piece of fish and handed it to Ye Xuan.
Her hands were very, very dirty!
Ye Xuan's heart ached when he saw this. He took the piece of fish and put it in his mouth. After eating it, he blinked and smiled. "I want more!"
The little girl looked at Ye Xuan.
Xuan blinked, and then she tore off another piece of fish and gave it to Ye Xuan. After Ye Xuan finished eating, he looked at the grilled fish in the little girl's hand. The little girl hesitated for a moment, then tore off another piece of fish and gave it to Ye Xuan.
However, Ye Xuan didn't take it. He pointed at the fish in the little girl's arms. At this moment, the fish was already dead!
The little girl understood what Ye Xuan meant. She hesitated for a while and then handed the fish to Ye Xuan. After Ye Xuan cleaned the fish, he started grilling it.
Soon, Ye Xuan finished grilling the fish and shared it with the little girl!
At this moment, the little girl was no longer wary of him.
After eating the fish, Ye Xuan suddenly stood up and extended his hand to the little girl. He smiled and said, "Let's go home!"
Home!
The little girl was stunned. Then, she lowered her head slightly.
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "I'll grill fish for you for the rest of your life!"
The little girl looked up at Ye Xuan. She just looked at Ye Xuan with a confused look in her eyes.
Ye Xuan looked at the little girl with a smile. His hand was still extended in the same way.
A moment later, the little girl suddenly extended her hand and placed it in Ye Xuan's.
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "Let's go!"
Just as the little girl was about to stand up, she seemed to have affected her wounds. She immediately gasped and looked at Ye Xuan with tears in her eyes. "It hurts!"
Looking at the little girl who was covered in injuries, Ye Xuan felt like a knife was being twisted in his heart. He hurriedly squatted down and took out a pill for the little girl. "Here, take it!"
The little girl didn't refuse. She opened her mouth and swallowed the pill. Very quickly, the pill transformed into a pure energy that spread throughout her body. In a short while, all the injuries on her body had basically recovered!
The little girl moved her hands. Then she lifted her head to look at Ye Xuan. The shocked look on her face was very cute!
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "It's amazing, right?"
The little girl nodded vigorously.
Ye Xuan laughed and pulled the little girl's hand. "Let's go home!"
The little girl nodded. She held onto Ye Xuan's hand tightly as if she was afraid that Ye Xuan would run away!
Ye Xuan pulled the little girl and slowly walked into the distance!
At this moment, Ye Zhiming's voice suddenly sounded in Ye Xuan's mind, "She is!"
Ye Xuan said softly in his heart, "I know!"
Ye Zhiming said solemnly, "Now I understand something!"
Ye Xuan asked, "What is it?"
Ye Zhiming said, "She was born because of the Fifth Dimension and then died because of the Fifth Dimension. If I'm not wrong, she was able to be reborn because you cured the Fifth Dimension!"
The Fifth Dimension!
The current Fifth Dimension was unprecedentedly good!
Not only were there more than 160 Dragon Veins, there were also more than 10,000 Heaven and Earth Spirits. Other than that, under Ye Xuan's management, there were no more wars in the Fifth Dimension. No super experts dared to fight in the Fifth Dimension!
Moreover, Ye Xuan also brought back some top-grade ore veins. These top-grade ore veins could also nourish the Heaven and Earth.
Under such circumstances, not only had the Fifth Dimension's Tribulation completely disappeared, the origin of the Fifth Dimension, which was the Origin Spirit, had also been restored.
At this moment, Ye Zhiming said again, "The origin of the Fifth Dimension has been restored and the Fifth Dimension's Tribulation has also disappeared. In other words, there is no need for her to suppress it … It was this universe that allowed her to be reborn.
However, what I don't understand is why she lost her memories and doesn't have any power! "
Ye Xuan looked at the little girl beside him. He was also very curious!
He could now confirm that this little girl was Sister Nian!
However, why did Sister Nian lose her memories? Not only that, she also completely lost her power!
Could it be because of her previous injuries?
At this moment, Ye Xuan suddenly stopped. Not far away from him stood an old man.
Bai
Emperor's son!
Bai Dizi just stared at the little girl beside Ye Xuan!
The little girl was somewhat afraid and hurriedly hid behind Ye Xuan.
Bai Dizi gave Ye Xuan a deep look before turning to leave.
Ye Xuan was silent.
He knew that Bai Dizi already knew that the little girl behind him was Sister Nian!
At this moment, Qing Yaoyao suddenly appeared not far away from Ye Xuan. She looked at the little girl who only had her head poked out from behind Ye Xuan in silence.
Ye Xuan looked at Qing Yaoyao, not saying anything.
After a moment, Qing Yaoyao softly said, "Have you thought about the consequences?"
Ye Xuan smiled. "What consequences?"
Qing Yaoyao looked at Ye Xuan. "They won't let her recover her memories and strength!
They will do it at all costs! "
Ye Xuan smiled. "Then what about the Dao Tomb?"
Qing Yaoyao shook her head. "I don't know!
Her appearance will make everyone wary of you! "
With that, she glanced at the little girl behind Ye Xuan. "Take care!"
With that, she sighed softly and turned to leave.
She didn't expect this Fifth Dimension Tendo to still be alive. No, it should be rebirth!
This rebirth was definitely not a good thing for Ye Xuan.
This was because Mu Niannian had not only lost her memories, but also her strength!
Would Daoting help Mu Niannian recover her memories?
Would Daoting help Mu Niannian recover her strength?
No!
Daoting would kill this little girl at all costs!
At all costs!
On the field, Ye Xuan was silent.
He naturally understood what Qing Yaoyao meant!
He originally needed time to develop, but now he didn't have any!
At this moment, the little girl suddenly tugged at Ye Xuan's hand. "They …"
Ye Xuan smiled. He looked at the little girl. "Don't worry. With me here, no one can hurt you!
No one! "
With that, he squatted down and smiled. "Come, I'll carry you home!"
The little girl blinked, then shook her head. "Dirty!"
Ye Xuan smiled. "Nian Nian isn't dirty at all!"
With that, he bent his body.
The little girl hesitated, then climbed onto Ye Xuan's back.
Ye Xuan carried the little girl and walked away slowly.
On the way, Ye Xuan suddenly asked, "Nian Nian, do you remember what happened in the past?"
The little girl shook her head. "I don't remember!"
Ye Xuan asked, "Not at all?"
The little girl was silent.
Ye Xuan asked, "Just a little?"
The little girl pressed her head against Ye Xuan's back and said softly, "I think I had a dream … That dream was very long, but I don't remember many things in the dream!
But … "
Ye Xuan hurriedly asked, "But what?"
The little girl glanced at Ye Xuan and said softly, "I think you were in that dream!"
Ye Xuan was stunned. Then, he smiled. "Really?"
The little girl nodded. "Really!"
Ye Xuan said with a smile, "Am I good or bad in your dream?"
The little girl thought about it and said, "In the dream, you were always causing trouble … I don't remember anything else!"
Ye Xuan slowly walked away with the little girl on his back. He didn't know when, but his cheeks were covered in tears …
....
PS: I also had a dream. In the dream, I was first in the monthly votes. There were so many monthly votes … There were people fighting to vote for me every day …









Chapter 1396
Ye Xuan brought the little girl back to the Sword Hall where he lived. Guan Yin was also in the hall.
Ye Xuan brought the little girl to Guan Yin. He looked at Guan Yin and said, "Take her to clean up!"
Guan Yin nodded slightly. "Alright!"
With that, she stretched out her hand to the little girl.
However, the little girl hid behind Ye Xuan.
Guan Yin looked at Ye Xuan. Ye Xuan squatted down and grabbed the little girl's hands. He smiled and said, "It's alright. Big sister is also a good person. She won't hurt you!"
The little girl glanced at Guan Yin and lowered her head slightly.
Ye Xuan gently rubbed the little girl's head and said softly, "Don't be afraid. Tell me who bullied you. I'll beat him to death!"
The little girl raised her head and looked at Ye Xuan. She said softly, "You … don't go …"
Ye Xuan smiled. "I won't go!
Go take a bath with big sister and change into a nice set of clothes, okay? "
The little girl looked at her clothes. She hesitated for a long time before nodding.
Ye Xuan looked at Guan Yin. Guan Yin held the little girl's hand and walked towards the inner hall.
Inside the hall, Ye Xuan sat cross-legged on the ground and slowly closed his eyes.
Ye Zhiming suddenly said, "What do you think Daoting will do next?"
Ye Xuan didn't say anything.
What will Daoting do?
A moment later, Ye Xuan left the Sword Hall and came to the fish stall where he first met Nian Nian.
At this moment, there was no one here.
Ye Xuan walked to the fish stall. There was a corpse in front of the fish stall. It was the corpse of the fishmonger.
After a moment of silence, Ye Xuan opened his palm and the Soul Suppressing Sword appeared in his hand. The next moment, the Soul Suppressing Sword trembled slightly and a shadow floated out!
It was the soul of the fishmonger who had whipped Nian Nian!
He had used the Soul Suppressing Sword to kill the fishmonger. Although the Soul Suppressing Sword had absorbed the fishmonger's soul, it hadn't completely digested it. Thus, his soul was still there.
Seeing Ye Xuan, the fishmonger hurriedly kowtowed and said with a trembling voice. "Spare me, spare me …"
Ye Xuan looked at the fishmonger. "It was Nian Nian's fault for stealing your fish. It was my fault for killing you."
As he spoke, he opened his palm, and then pressed it lightly towards Fishmonger. Very soon, a mysterious force enveloped Fishmonger, and gradually, Fishmonger's soul entered his body. Not long after, Fishmonger slowly opened his eyes. He looked at the sky with slight confusion, and he found it hard to believe that he was still alive.
As if he had thought of something, the fishmonger hurriedly got up. He knelt before Ye Xuan and kowtowed as if pounding garlic. "Thank you, Immortal, for not killing me. Thank you, Immortal, for not killing me …"
Ye Xuan opened his palm. A black scroll and a bottle of pills landed in front of the fishmonger. "This is a cultivation technique. If you cultivate this technique, it shouldn't be difficult for you to live for a hundred years.
Sister Nian ate one of your fish, and I gave you a fortune. We're even. "
As he spoke, he turned and left.
Behind him, the fishmonger was still kowtowing crazily. However, at this moment, he wasn't afraid, but excited and agitated.
After Ye Xuan left the city gate, he suddenly said, "Come!"
As his voice fell, a shadow appeared beside him and bowed respectfully.
Ye Xuan said softly, "Secretly observe him. If he's evil, kill him. If he's good, help him!"
The shadow bowed respectfully. "Yes!"
As he spoke, he quietly disappeared.
Ye Xuan slowly closed his eyes. "Sister Nian, we don't owe anyone anything, even if it's a fish …"
After he finished speaking, he also disappeared.
...
Heaven Realm Abyss, Heavenly Palace.
Inside the palace, Bai Dizi sat on a chair and did not speak for a long time.
He had been sitting for a full two hours. During this time, he did not say a word!
Next to him, True Martial Divine Lord and White Robe's expressions were extremely grave.
They did not expect that Mu Niannian had been reborn!
Reborn!
That woman was not Ye Xuan!
Ye Xuan's threat was in the future, but that woman's threat was now!
Now that the Fifth Dimension had recovered its vitality, there was no need for her to suppress it!
What did this mean?
It meant that once she recovered her memories, she would be in her peak state.
How terrifying would a peak Fifth Dimension Tendo be?
Could she instantly kill a Dao Ancestor?
Most likely!
As they thought of this, the three people's expressions became even uglier.
At this moment, Bai Dizi suddenly said softly, "She has lost her memories!
She has lost her strength! "
White Robe and True Martial looked at Bai Dizi. Bai Dizi slowly closed his eyes. "In other words, the current her has no strength at all!"
Hearing this, True Martial narrowed his eyes, and a cold light flashed in his eyes!
If Mu Niannian was in her peak state, even if everyone in the Daoting joined forces, they would not be her opponent. However, she had lost her memories and strength!
Right now, she was just an ordinary little girl!
A little girl who could be killed with a flick of a finger!
At this moment, White Robe suddenly said, "This matter cannot be delayed!"
Bai Dizi nodded. Their top priority now was to get rid of Mu Niannian as soon as possible. Otherwise, who knew when she would regain her memories and strength?
Perhaps it would be tomorrow!
True Martial suddenly said, "There is another problem!
The Dao Tomb! "
Bai Dizi stood up. "I will go talk to them!"
True Martial looked at Bai Dizi. "What if they can't come to an agreement?"
Bai Dizi did not even turn his head. "Then we will all perish together!
True Martial, White Robe, gather all the experts in the Daoting. Remember, all of them! "
With that, he had already disappeared into the distance.
...
Dao Tomb City.
Bai Dizi came to the Dao Tomb City alone. He had just entered when Luo Hou appeared in front of him. Kay Yaoyao, Bitter King, and Zhan Man were also there.
Bai Dizi went straight to the point. "Mu Niannian's death is beneficial to both of us!"
Kay Yaoyao smiled. "It's beneficial to the Daoting, right?"
Bai Dizi looked at Kay Yaoyao. "Yaoyao, does the Dao Tomb really want to see such a powerful person appear?"
The corners of Kay Yaoyao's mouth curled up. "Why not?
Her appearance is not detrimental to us. On the contrary, if she regains her memories and strength, the first person she will kill will be the Daoting, right? "
Bai Dizi smiled. "Then let's not talk about it!
Perish together! "
With that, he turned and disappeared into the horizon.
Perish together!
The smile on Kay Yaoyao's face gradually faded.
She knew that the Daoting was not joking!
Because the Daoting had no way out!
If they did not get rid of Mu Niannian now, once Mu Niannian regained her memories and strength, the Daoting's life would be in the hands of Mu Niannian.
It could be said that they would kill Mu Niannian at all costs!
Even if they had to perish together with the Dao Tomb!
At this moment, Luo Hou suddenly said, "We cannot interfere!"
Kay Yaoyao looked at Luo Hou. Luo Hou said softly, "The Daoting is already desperate!"
Kay Yaoyao was silent.
Luo Hou looked at Kay Yaoyao. "What do you think?"
Kay Yaoyao said, "We have two choices. The first is to watch from the sidelines and let the Daoting and Ye Xuan fight to the death while we reap the benefits!"
Luo Hou said, "The second?"
Kay Yaoyao said, "The second is to help Ye Xuan fight the Daoting until Mu Niannian regains her memories and strength!"
The Bitter King suddenly said, "What are the benefits?"
Kay Yaoyao said, "The benefit is to form an alliance with the Fifth Dimension, a true alliance. In the future, we will have a powerful ally!"
The Bitter King shook his head.
Luo Hou also shook his head.
Ally?
They never believed in allies!
Moreover, at that time, Mu Niannian's Fifth Dimension would be suppressing the Dao Tomb!
Just as the White Emperor's son had said, they did not wish for someone as powerful as Mu Niannian to appear!
Kay Yaoyao was silent. She already knew everyone's choice.
For now, the first choice was the most suitable for the Dao Tomb!
Wouldn't it be better to let Ye Xuan and the Daoting fight to the death?
After all, the Dao Tomb did not need to do anything and they could reap the benefits!
If Ye Xuan lost, the Dao Tomb would not suffer any losses. If the Daoting lost, it would be a great thing for the Dao Tomb!
At this moment, Kay Yaoyao suddenly said, "I will go to the Fifth Dimension!"
She was about to leave when Luo Hou suddenly said, "Celestial Monarch!"
Ye Xuan turned to look at Luo Hou and smiled, "You can't be too ruthless. What do you think?"
Luo Hou was silent for a moment, then said, "Have a sense of propriety!"
Kay Yaoyao did not say anything else and disappeared into the horizon.
...
In the Fifth Dimension.
In the Sword Hall, Guan Yin walked out with the little girl. At this moment, the little girl looked completely different. Her hair had been tied into a braid by Guan Yin. She looked extremely cute!
The little girl's appearance was completely different from Sister Nian, but Ye Xuan knew that she was Sister Nian.
When she saw Ye Xuan, Nian Nian ran to his side and grabbed his arm. She looked up at Ye Xuan and said, "Eat fish!"
Eat fish!
Ye Xuan laughed, "Let's go, I will roast fish for you!"
After saying this, he pulled Nian Nian out of the hall.
Inside the hall, Guan Yin was silent, his expression extremely solemn.
Sister Nian's rebirth was naturally a great thing for the Fifth Dimension.
However, there was a fatal problem, and that was that Sister Nian had lost her memories and power!
At this time, would the Daoting give Sister Nian time?
Of course not!
The Daoting would definitely kill Sister Nian at all costs!
The Fifth Dimension would not be peaceful anymore.
....
Ye Xuan brought Nian Nian to a river. This was the place where he and Mu Niannian had first met. At that time, he did not know that this woman was the Tendo of the Fifth Dimension!
Qing 'er was also there at that time!
After Ye Xuan caught a few fish from the river, he looked at Nian Nian and said with a smile, "Which one do you like?"
Nian Nian pointed at the largest one with her little finger!
Ye Xuan laughed. He cleaned up the fish quickly and started a fire to roast it.
Nian Nian walked to Ye Xuan's side and sat down next to Ye Xuan, her eyes fixed on the roasted fish in front of her.
Ye Xuan suddenly said, "Nian Nian, why were you on the street?"
Nian Nian shook her head. "I don't know!"
Ye Xuan turned to look at Nian Nian. "Don't you remember why you were on the street?"
Nian Nian nodded.
Ye Xuan was silent.
Nian Nian's last memory should be on that street!
Ye Xuan turned to look at Nian Nian. Nian Nian hugged Ye Xuan's arm with both hands and said softly, "I … Can I always follow you?"
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "Of course you can!"
Nian Nian looked at Ye Xuan. "Really?"
Ye Xuan nodded. "Really!
I'll roast fish for you every day from now on! "
Nian Nian looked at Ye Xuan and the corners of her mouth curled up slightly.
Soon, the fish was roasted!
Ye Xuan lay on the ground and looked at the sky.
At this moment, he felt that life was really beautiful!
Sister Nian was still here!
At this moment, he was also very glad that he had not done something stupid back then and had properly treated the Fifth Dimension!
The current Fifth Dimension had never been better, and the creatures of the Fifth Dimension had never been more united.
If Sister Nian recovered her memories and saw the current Fifth Dimension, how happy would she be?
Thinking of this, Ye Xuan could not help but feel a little proud.
At this moment, Nian Nian suddenly said, "It's done!"
After saying that, she picked up the roasted fish, tore off a piece of fish, and handed it to Ye Xuan's mouth. "Eat!"
Ye Xuan laughed and bit the piece of fish.
Nian Nian blinked. "Is it delicious?"
Ye Xuan nodded and said seriously, "Of course it's delicious. Don't you see who roasted the fish?"
Nian Nian giggled. "Bullsh * t!"
Ye Xuan laughed.
At this moment, an old man suddenly appeared by the river.
The person who had come was Bai Dizi.
Ye Xuan glanced at Bai Dizi and continued eating the fish.
Nian Nian was a little wary. She hugged Ye Xuan's arm tightly.
Bai Dizi looked at Nian Nian. "I miscalculated!
I should have destroyed your main body back then! "
The Fifth Dimension Tendo was not a human. She was born for the Fifth Dimension and died for the Fifth Dimension. Her life was closely related to the Fifth Dimension. As long as the Fifth Dimension did not perish, she could live because of the Fifth Dimension!
Of course, the most important thing was that her strength was still there!
Her main body was also there. Although her soul had scattered between heaven and earth, it had not shattered. The Fifth Dimension had condensed her soul again!
Ye Xuan turned to look at Nian Nian and said with a smile, "Don't be afraid!
I'm here! "
Nian Nian nodded slightly and hugged Ye Xuan's arm tightly.
In the distance, Bai Dizi looked at Ye Xuan. "Ye Xuan, give her to us. Otherwise, I, Daoting, will destroy you!"
Ye Xuan looked at Bai Dizi and said with a smile, "Come on!"
....









Chapter 1397
By the river, Bai Dizi just stared at Ye Xuan.
Ye Xuan smiled. "Daoting. If you want to die together with me, I, Ye Xuan, will welcome you at any time!"
Bai Dizi chuckled. "Do you think the Dao Tomb Land will help you?
Ye Xuan, you … "
Ye Xuan suddenly looked at Bai Dizi. "Scram!"
With that, he picked up the sword beside him and slashed out.
In the distance, Bai Dizi's pupils suddenly shrank. He disappeared on the spot and reappeared tens of thousands of li away!
By the river, Ye Xuan shook his head. It wasn't that he didn't want to kill Bai Dizi, but that this person wasn't easy to kill!
This person might not be good at fighting, but he was first-rate at escaping!
As soon as he slashed out with his sword, Bai Dizi was already tens of thousands of li away!
Even the sword qi couldn't catch up!
At this moment, Nian Nian, who was beside Ye Xuan, suddenly said, "He … why does he want to kill me?"
Ye Xuan collected his thoughts. He looked at Nian Nian and smiled. "Don't be afraid. I'm here!"
Nian Nian nodded. "Alright!"
Ye Xuan pulled Nian Nian to get up and leave.
At this moment, Qing Yaoyao suddenly appeared in front of the two.
Qing Yaoyao glanced at Nian Nian and then at Ye Xuan. "Let's talk?"
Ye Xuan smiled. "Let's talk!"
The three walked along the river into the distance.
On the way, Qing Yaoyao said softly, "The Dao Tomb Land has decided not to interfere!"
Ye Xuan nodded. "I guessed it!"
Qing Yaoyao turned to look at Ye Xuan. "Is the person behind you going to appear?"
Ye Xuan smiled. "No!"
Qing Yaoyao looked at Ye Xuan. "Then what do you have to rely on?"
Ye Xuan said softly, "I don't have anything to rely on. It's just my life!"
Qian Yaoyao stared at Ye Xuan without saying a word.
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "I'm telling the truth!"
After a moment of silence, Yan Yaoyao looked at Nian Nian. Nian Nian was a little timid and hid behind Ye Xuan.
Qian Yaoyao softly said, "You must help her recover her memories and strength as soon as possible!"
Ye Xuan shook his head. "Let nature take its course!"
He also wanted Nian Nian to recover her memory and strength, but this matter could not be rushed. Moreover, he had no other way. This matter could only rely on Nian Nian himself!
Qian Yaoyao looked at Ye Xuan. "Are you really going to risk your life?"
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "Do I have any other way?"
Feng Yaoyao was silent.
Ye Xuan suddenly said, "Miss Yaoyao should have other matters to discuss today, right?"
After a long silence, Qian Yaoyao opened her palm and an ancient scroll appeared in front of Ye Xuan.
Ye Xuan was a little curious. "This is?"
Chi Yaoyao said, "Daoting's information!
The number of Daoting's experts and trump cards are basically all inside. Of course, I can't be sure if Daoting has other trump cards, but Daoting's experts are basically all inside! "
Ye Xuan put away the scroll. "Thank you!"
Qian Yaoyao shook her head. "It's just a small favor!"
Saying that, she glanced at Nian Nian. "Because of my position, I can't help you any more. Take care!"
After saying that, her figure trembled and disappeared.
In the same place, Ye Xuan was silent.
At this moment, a phantom suddenly appeared not far from Ye Xuan. The phantom gradually solidified. It was a black-robed man.
Ye Xuan flicked his finger and a token appeared in front of the black-robed man.
This black-robed man was none other than the mysterious person who had given him the ice coffin!
The mysterious person looked at Ye Xuan. "I'll help you once!"
Ye Xuan smiled. "Senior, can you beat a Dao Attainment Realm expert?"
The mysterious person shook his head. "I can't, but I can barely hold up a Dao Attainment Realm expert!"
Ye Xuan nodded. "That's enough!"
After saying that, he pulled Nian Nian away.
In the same place, the mysterious person was silent for a long time before saying softly, "Daoting … Are you really going to bully his son … How dare you!"
After saying that, he disappeared without a sound.
...
At the end of the distance, Nian Nian held Ye Xuan's hand tightly. "Is someone coming to beat us up?"
Ye Xuan smiled. "Yes!
Are you afraid? "
Nian Nian looked at Ye Xuan and asked, "Are you afraid?"
Ye Xuan blinked. "A little!"
Nian Nian hesitated for a moment before saying, "Then I'm a little afraid too!"
Ye Xuan laughed.
After a moment, Nian Nian said again, "Are they going to beat me up?"
Ye Xuan nodded. "Yes!"
Nian Nian said, "Will you protect me?"
Ye Xuan said, "Yes!"
Nian Nian said, "What if you can't beat them?"
Ye Xuan said, "What do you think I should do?"
Nian Nian said, "If you hand me over, will they stop beating you up?"
Ye Xuan said, "No, their goal is to kill you and then kill me!"
After a long time.
Nian Nian said again, "Why are you protecting me?"
Ye Xuan said, "There's no reason. I just want to protect you!"
Nian Nian said softly, "But there should be a reason for everything!"
Ye Xuan said, "Because I like you, so I'm protecting you. Is that a good reason?"
Nian Nian stopped in her tracks. She looked at Ye Xuan and asked seriously, "Do you really like me?"
Ye Xuan nodded.
Nian Nian asked again, "Why?"
Ye Xuan was speechless.
Nian Nian said, "Why do you like me?
There must be a reason! "
Ye Xuan asked, "Why do you like eating fish?"
Nian Nian said, "If you like it, then eat it. There's no reason!"
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "I like you like fish. If I like you, then I like you. There's no reason!"
Nian Nian said, "But I'm not a fish!"
After a moment of silence, Ye Xuan said, "Why don't we change the topic?"
Nian Nian said, "Alright!"
Ye Xuan heaved a sigh of relief.
Nian Nian said, "What do you like about me?"
Ye Xuan said, "I like everything!"
Nian Nian said, "Why do you like everything?
I like eating fish, but I don't like fish bones!
There must be something about me that you don't like! "
Ye Xuan fell silent.
Nian Nian said, "Why?"
Ye Xuan said, "I don't like it when you lie to me."
Nian Nian blinked. "Have I ever lied to you?"
Ye Xuan nodded. "In my dream, we went to a place. You lied to me and said that we would definitely come back together, but you didn't."
Nian Nian held Ye Xuan's hand and said with some heartache, "Don't be angry. I won't lie to you next time!"
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "It's a deal!"
Nian Nian said seriously, "Definitely!"
Soon, the two of them disappeared at the end of the river hand in hand.
..
In the sky above the Fifth Dimension.
Ying Yaoyao looked down and remained silent.
Beside her was Luo Huo.
Luo Huo said in a deep voice, "The Daoting has already gathered all the experts!
Everyone who is in seclusion, except for the Dao Ancestors, has already rushed to the Heaven Abyss! "
Ying Yaoyao was silent.
Luo Huo said, "The Daoting is going to destroy everything this time!
They will kill Mu Niannian at all costs! "
Saying so, he looked at Ying Yaoyao. "Heavenly Monarch, I know you love talent, but this Ye Xuan is a huge whirlpool. Our Dao Burial Mound cannot be dragged into this whirlpool, or we will be consigned to eternal damnation!"
Ying Yaoyao nodded. "I understand!"
Luo Huo sighed. "To be honest, I also admire this Ye Xuan. Unfortunately, he is not from our Dao Burial Mound."
Ying Yaoyao suddenly said, "Luo Huo, do you think our Dao Burial Mound should change?" Luo Huo looked at Ying Yaoyao. "What do you want to change?"
Ying Yaoyao smiled. "What are we fighting for?"
Luo Huo was silent.
Ying Yaoyao looked at Luo Huo. "We are fighting for our own interests!
Back then, we became Dao Breakers because the Great Dao was unfair. We fought for the beliefs in our hearts. But now, our Dao Burial Mound has lost its beliefs. No one is fighting for their own interests.
If we destroy the Daoting, we will be the next Daoting! "
Luo Huo said nothing.
Ying Yaoyao said softly, "Our original intentions!
We don't know when, but we have forgotten our original intentions.
Why can't anyone create a new path on the path of Dao Breakers?
Because we are no different from the Daoting in the first place! "
With that, she turned and left.
Luo Huo said in a low voice, "Where are you going?"
In the distance, Chi Yaoyao didn't even look back. "Follow my heart!"
With that, she disappeared into the distance.
Luo Huo was silent.
....
Ye Xuan didn't bring Nian Nian back to the Sword Hall. Instead, he brought her to the Fourth Dimension.
The Nether Hall!
Ye Xuan came to this place again. The hall was deserted with only a few statues.
Ye Xuan looked at the statues and said softly, "Is anyone there?"
No response!
Ye Xuan was silent for a long time. Then, he turned and left with Nian Nian.
...
Outside the hall, Ye Xuan wasn't disappointed. He didn't put his hopes on others.
It was naturally good for him to find a helper, but it didn't matter if he couldn't!
Meanwhile, a voice suddenly resounded within the hall. "Is there something you need?"
Ye Xuan turned around and looked into the hall, but there was no one there.
Ye Xuan bowed slightly. "May I know who it is?"
The voice resounded once more. "Is there something you need?"
Ye Xuan hesitated for a moment and said, "Does Senior know about Daoting?"
The voice replied, "I don't!"
Ye Xuan was speechless.
The voice spoke again. "Is there something you need?"
Ye Xuan thought for a moment and said, "Senior, can you help me with something?"
The voice fell silent for a moment before it said, "What is it!?"
Ye Xuan said, "Fight!"
The voice fell silent.
Ye Xuan waited silently for an answer!
After a long time, the voice resounded once more. "Someone has told me!
I don't want to help you! "
Ye Xuan blinked. "Who!?
Who!? "
The voice replied, "Someone you know!"
Ye Xuan was quite stunned.
Someone I know?
Could it be that mysterious expert within Ye Ling's body?
Or perhaps it's that woman with the spear?
Meanwhile, the voice spoke again. "Your path is very long, and you have to walk it yourself. The path you walk is the path that belongs to you. Do you understand what I mean?"
Ye Xuan spoke in a low voice. "Senior, Daoting wants to gang up on me!
There are many of them! "
The voice replied, "Deal with it yourself!"
Ye Xuan hesitated for a moment before he said, "Can you help me a little?"
The voice replied, "No!"
Ye Xuan laughed miserably. "Forget it!
In any case, I've been orphaned since I was young, and I've had to endure all sorts of disasters … Alas, let's not talk about it!
It's meaningless to talk about it!
In any case, I'm an orphan … I'll get used to it!
I'll get used to it! "
As he spoke, he pulled Nian Nian towards the distance.
At this moment, a voice suddenly resounded from within the hall. "Wait!"
.....
PS: Thank you for your monthly votes and tips, thank you!
Thank you for your support!
I'm going to buy a car soon. Do you have any suggestions?
A two-wheeled one …









Chapter 1398
Outside the Nether Palace, Ye Xuan stopped in his tracks.
At this moment, the voice sounded from inside the palace, "We are too far away from here, do you understand what I mean?"
Ye Xuan was silent.
At this moment, the voice sounded again.
No one knew what the voice said, but Ye Xuan suddenly looked happy. He bowed slightly to the Nether Palace, then turned around and left with Nian Nian.
...
Ye Xuan returned to the Fifth Dimension with Nian Nian, and at this moment, the Fifth Dimension was on full alert!
Ye Xuan arrived at the Sword Sect, where hundreds of Swordsman from the Sword Sect were already waiting.
All the Swordsman had reached the Self Release Realm.
Although they were only at the Self Release Realm, they had the strength to fight Dao Validation Realm!
But this was not enough!
Ye Xuan found Senior Sister Lu and took out a storage ring and handed it to her.
Senior Sister Lu looked at Ye Xuan, "What's inside?"
Ye Xuan smiled, "Look!"
Senior Sister Lu glanced at it, and the next moment, her expression changed drastically, "This …"
Inside the storage ring were some divine objects!
Those were the treasures of the Jia Long Clan!
Among them, there were countless treasures of the Dao Validation Realm!
Although there were few treasures of the Dao Validation Realm, there were still some!
After all, Ye Xuan's Soul Suppressing Sword was only at the Dao Validation Realm!
Senior Sister Lu looked at Ye Xuan, "Where did you go to rob!"
Ye Xuan smiled, "A senior gave it to me!"
After a moment of silence, Senior Sister Lu said, "With this equipment, my Sword Sect's Swordsman can kill Dao Validation Realm!
Gu Nian and the others can kill Dao Validation Realm! "
Ye Xuan nodded, "Okay!"
After saying that, he turned around and left with Nian Nian.
At this moment, Senior Sister Lu suddenly said, "Are you confident?"
Ye Xuan stopped and turned to look at Senior Sister Lu, smiling, "No!"
Senior Lu fell silent.
Ye Xuan gently rubbed Nian Nian's little head and said with a smile, "Senior Martial Sister, can you summon the Patriarch of the Sword Sect?"
Senior Sister Lu shook her head.
Ye Xuan shrugged. "Others can summon their ancestors. Senior Sister Lu, you should also summon your ancestor!"
Senior-apprentice Sister Lu glared at Ye Xuan. "Scram!"
Ye Xuan laughed and left with Nian Nian.
...
Ye Xuan brought Nian Nian to the Sword Hall. He took out the World Prison Pagoda. At this moment, a woman appeared in front of him.
Najialou!
He was the last dragon of the Jia Dragon Clan!
Jialou looked at Ye Xuan. "I want to cultivate a Dao Body!
Can I? "
Ye Xuan blinked. "Can you cultivate?"
Jialou nodded. "Grandfather said that I can cultivate, but he doesn't think he will give it to me!"
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "I'll teach!"
Jialou looked at Ye Xuan. "Really?"
Ye Xuan nodded. "But you have to help me fight!"
Jialou took out a stick of tanghulu and licked it. Then, he said, "No problem!"
Next, Ye Xuan began to teach Jialou the Dao Body!
In fact, if time allowed, he wanted to teach An Lanxiu and the others the Dao Body!
Unfortunately, time did not allow it!
Moreover, the Dao Body was not easy to cultivate. This was because An Lanxiu and the others had weak physical bodies. The reason he could cultivate it so quickly was because his physical body's foundation was very, very strong!
In the Five-Dimensional Universe, there was almost no one whose physical body had reached his level!
Of course, Jialou was one of them!
She was a member of the Dragon Clan, so her physical body was naturally strong. Once she cultivated a Dao Body and reached the Dao Defense Realm, the strength of her physical body would definitely be above his.
If Jialou could cultivate a Dao Body, she would definitely be able to fight a Dao Realization Realm expert!
Even if she could not win, she would definitely be able to fight a Dao Realization Realm expert!
In the following time, Ye Xuan taught Jialou the Dao Body every day to accompany Nian Nian!
Of course, he did not forget about Daoting!
In a certain hall, Ye Xuan sat to the side and roasted fish. Beside him was Nian Nian, and in front of him stood a black-robed old man.
The black-robed old man bowed slightly to Ye Xuan. "Young Master Ye, Daoting experts have already rushed to the Celestial Abyss. I'm afraid they will come to the Five-Dimensional Universe in the next few days. Young Master Ye, please make early preparations!"
Ye Xuan said, "How many in total?"
The black-robed old man looked at Ye Xuan. "Anyone who has reached the Dao Confirmation Realm has gone to the Celestial Abyss!
In addition, this time, Daoting will probably use some trump cards that have never been used before. Also, that Dao Ancestor is very likely to appear. Young Master Ye, you must make early preparations! "
Ye Xuan was silent.
The black-robed old man cupped his fists. "If Daoting makes any new moves, this old man will inform Young Master Ye immediately!
Goodbye! "
After saying that, he was about to leave.
At this time, Ye Xuan suddenly said, "Thank the Celestial King for me!"
The black-robed old man nodded. "This old man will definitely deliver it!"
After saying that, he disappeared.
In the hall, Ye Xuan slowly closed his eyes.
At this time, Nian Nian suddenly said softly, "Are they all here to beat me?"
Ye Xuan shook his head. "No, they're all here to beat me!"
Nian Nian looked at Ye Xuan. "You lied to me!"
Ye Xuan said with a smile, "Alright!
They're all here to beat me! "
Nian Nian blinked. "Why?
Just because I stole the fish?
But … but I'm really hungry … I won't steal fish next time! "
Ye Xuan gently rubbed Nian Nian's head and said softly, "What's a mere fish?
Our entire Fifth Dimension owes her! "
If not for Sister Nian, would the Fifth Dimension still exist?
It probably wouldn't even exist anymore!
It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that the entire Fifth Dimension owes her!
At this time, Guan Yin walked in.
Guan Yin looked at Ye Xuan. "The Fifth Dimension is ready!"
Ye Xuan said, "The battlefield cannot be in the Fifth Dimension!"
Guan Yin nodded.
If the battlefield was in the Fifth Dimension, once a fight broke out, regardless of whether the Fifth Dimension won or lost, it would still suffer heavy losses!
Guan Yin said in a deep voice, "But their goal is not only to kill Miss Nian, but also to destroy the Fifth Dimension!"
Ye Xuan was silent.
The current Daoting must have learned to be smart. Killing Sister Nian was not enough. If they wanted to get rid of future troubles, they had to destroy the entire Fifth Dimension!
As long as the entire Fifth Dimension was destroyed, there would be no possibility of Sister Nian being reborn!
At this time, Guan Yin said softly, "It would be great if Miss Nian could regain her memory!"
The current Fifth Dimension no longer needed Mu Niannian to suppress it. Once Mu Niannian regained her memory, Daoting and the Dao Tomb would be like ants to her!
Therefore, Daoting would definitely destroy the Fifth Dimension!
But would Sister Nian regain her memory?
Ye Xuan glanced at Nian Nian next to him. He was not sure, either.
Sister Nian had really forgotten everything in the past!
As for when she would regain her memory, no one knew!
Ye Xuan was silent for a moment before smiling. "It's okay, I'll take care of it this time!"
Guan Yin looked at Ye Xuan. "Can you take care of it?"
Ye Xuan smiled. "Don't we still have you?"
Guan Yin was stunned for a moment before smiling. "Let's take care of it together!"
Ye Xuan said, "Have Ah Jiu and Aro come out of seclusion?"
Guan Yin said in a low voice, "Soon!"
Ye Xuan nodded. "That's good!"
After explaining some matters to Guan Yin, Guan Yin left. Ye Xuan continued to roast fish, but his thoughts had already drifted away.
Daoting had two Dao Realm experts!
One was a Dao Ancestor, and the other had disappeared for many years. Even the Dao Tomb did not know who he was.
And now, the only ones who could kill Ye Xuan single-handedly were powerhouses at the Dao Attainment Realm.
If he used the power of his bloodline, he might be able to fight a Dao Realm expert head-on.
It should be a three-to-seven chance!
But if Daoting and two Dao Realm experts attacked together, he would not stand a chance!
Two Dao Realm experts were definitely not people he could fight against at the moment.
After all, only his physical body had reached the Dao Imperial Realm. His realm had not reached the Dao Imperial Realm. Fighting one Dao Realm expert would be difficult, let alone two!
Apart from the experts of the Dao Realm, if Zhen Wu and the white-robed experts ganged up on him, he would not have much confidence in winning. These two people were infinitely close to the Dao Realm!
This time, Daoting would definitely not give him a chance. They would definitely choose to gang up on him!
And now, there were basically no other people in the Fifth Dimension, especially Dao Imperial Realm experts. Daoting Divine Lords, however, had a total of 76!
What did this mean?
This was equivalent to a total of 76 Dao Manipulation Realm experts in the Dao Court!
Daoting Dao Realm experts below the Dao Imperial Realm had a total of 167!
One hundred and sixty-seven!
It could be said that in terms of lineup, Daoting had completely crushed the Fifth Dimension!
Moreover, this was only the Daoting's strength on the surface!
The Dao Tomb did not know whether Daoting had more trump cards.
How could they fight?
Inside the hall, Ye Xuan was quietly roasting fish.
At this moment, Nian Nian suddenly hugged Ye Xuan's arm and said softly, "Did I drag you into this?"
Ye Xuan looked at Nian Nian and said with a smile, "No!
I dragged you into this! "
Without him, Ye Xuan, Sister Nian would not have fallen back then.
Nian Nian looked up at Ye Xuan. "Those dreams I had were not dreams, right?"
Ye Xuan hesitated for a moment, then nodded.
Nian Nian had only lost her memory. In fact, she was not stupid at all.
Nian Nian looked at Ye Xuan. "I lost my memory.
Am I right? "
Ye Xuan nodded.
Nian Nian asked again, "Was I very powerful before?"
Ye Xuan laughed. "Powerful!
Very, very powerful!
It is known as the fourth sword in the world! "
Nian Nian blinked. "There are three more swords?"
Ye Xuan nodded. "Yes!"
Nian Nian lowered her head slightly.
Ye Xuan asked softly, "What's wrong?"
Nian Nian hugged Ye Xuan's arm tightly with both hands. "I can't remember anything!"
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "It's okay!
If you can't remember, don't force yourself to remember! "
Nian Nian looked at Ye Xuan. "But I want to help!"
Ye Xuan gently rubbed Nian Nian's little head. "You've already helped me a lot!
This time, let me help you once, okay? "
Nian Nian looked at Ye Xuan and didn't say a word.
At that moment, Ye Xuan suddenly looked up. He saw a familiar old man in the starry sky.
Bai Dizi!
He's here!
In the hall, Ye Xuan smiled. Then he pulled Nian Nian to her feet and walked out of the hall.
Nian Nian held Ye Xuan's hand. "Can I call you brother?"
In the distance, Ye Xuan shook his head. "No!"
Nian Nian was a little puzzled. "Why?"
Ye Xuan said, "I'm afraid that he'll hit me after he recovers his memories!"
Nian Nian blinked. "Can't you beat me?"
Ye Xuan hesitated for a moment and was about to speak when Nian Nian suddenly said, "You promised me. Don't lie to me!"
Ye Xuan was a little helpless. "I can't beat him!
He might shatter my Dao Body with one punch! "
Nian Nian giggled and held Ye Xuan's hand tightly. "Don't be afraid. I won't hit him in the future!"
Ye Xuan hurriedly said, "Keep your promise!"
Nian Nian said seriously, "Pinky swear!"
As she spoke, she extended a finger.
Ye Xuan laughed. Then he also extended a finger.
Just like that, the two fingers gently hooked together.
Outside the hall, someone said, "I'll protect you in the future!"
....









Chapter 1399
In the Five-Dimensional Universe, in the starry sky, Bai Dizi looked down at the Five-Dimensional Universe with a calm expression.
Mu Niannian!
The moment he learned that Mu Niannian had been reborn, he really panicked!
No, it was fear!
Mu Niannian!
This woman had shattered the physical body of a Dao Ancestor with only 30% of her strength!
Once this woman regained her memory, she could destroy Daoting in the blink of an eye!
Fortunately, this woman had lost her memory and strength!
At this moment, Ye Xuan suddenly appeared in front of Bai Dizi. Beside Ye Xuan was Nian Nian.
Bai Dizi glanced at Ye Xuan, then at Nian Nian.
This time, Nian Nian was not afraid!
She looked at Bai Dizi, her right hand holding Ye Xuan's hand tightly.
Bai Dizi suddenly looked at Ye Xuan. "Just one person?"
Ye Xuan smiled. "Of course not!"
Bai Dizi nodded. "I'm looking forward to it!"
As soon as he finished speaking, the starry sky behind him suddenly split open. Then, countless powerful auras surged out like a tide.
The first to come out were White Robe and Zhen Wu, and behind them stood 76 Sir Gods!
All of them were Dao Defense Realm!
And behind these 76 people, there were 167 Dao Validation Realm powerhouses!
It could be said that all the powerhouses of Daoting had come out!
This time, Daoting was fighting with its back to the wall!
Although the strength of the Five-Dimensional Universe was not as strong as Daoting, once Mu Niannian regained her memory, the situation would be reversed!
Therefore, either Mu Niannian died, or Daoting perished!
Bai Dizi looked at Ye Xuan. "Ye Xuan, you can call the person behind you out!"
Ye Xuan nodded. He turned his head and saw a black-robed man not far away. It was the black-robed man who had given him the ice coffin!
This man in black had a mysterious background. Ye Xuan did not know his name, and he did not ask because the other party did not seem to want to have too much karma with him!
This time, the other party was here to help fight!
After the fight, the other party would probably leave.
Bai Dizi glanced at the man in black and then looked at Ye Xuan. "Anything else?"
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "Not for now!"
Bai Dizi stared at Ye Xuan. He suddenly felt uneasy.
Because Ye Xuan was too calm!
Based on his understanding of Ye Xuan, for this guy to be so calm, he definitely had something to rely on!
But what did this guy have to rely on?
The Dao Tomb would no longer interfere!
Did this guy really come from the Saha World?
Bai Dizi did not believe it at all.
At this moment, Ye Xuan suddenly said, "Bai Dizi, what are you waiting for?"
Bai Dizi looked at Ye Xuan. Ye Xuan smiled and said, "Why don't you attack together?"
Bai Dizi stared at Ye Xuan. "Deliberately mystifying!"
Then, he looked at the black-robed man not far away. "Your Excellency is?"
The black-robed man said, "I'm helping him fight, that's all!"
Bai Dizi was expressionless. "Your Excellency, no matter what price he offers, I will Daoting double it!"
The black-robed man shook his head. "It has nothing to do with money!"
Bai Dizi was about to say something when the black-robed man suddenly said, "Cut the crap!"
Then, he looked at Ye Xuan. "Who should I fight?"
Ye Xuan pointed at Zhen Wu and White Robe in the distance. "Those two!"
The black-robed man said, "I can only hold them back."
Ye Xuan nodded. "That's enough!"
The black-robed man nodded. The next moment, he disappeared on the spot.
In the distance, Zhen Wu looked at White Robe. "I'll hold him back!"
As soon as he finished speaking, he suddenly drew his sword and slashed forward.
Chi!
The sound of something tearing resounded!
Boom!
The space in front of Zhen Wu suddenly trembled violently. The next moment, he was blasted back dozens of feet!
Seeing this scene, Bai Dizi's expression darkened!
This black-robed man was actually so strong?
Zhen Wu gripped his sword tightly with his right hand. A powerful sword momentum gathered in his sword.
At this moment, the black-robed man appeared in front of him again.
The black-robed man threw a punch. A simple punch!
A ruthless look flashed in Zhen Wu's eyes. He slashed with his sword.
This sword seemed to be able to shatter the starry sky!
Boom!
The area where the two of them were exploded and turned into nothingness!
White Robe didn't attack. Even though Zhen Wu was at a disadvantage, it was still very difficult for the black-robed man to kill Zhen Wu!
White Robe looked at Ye Xuan. "He doesn't seem to be able to fight two at once!"
Ye Xuan fell silent.
At this moment, a sword howl resounded in the sky. In the next moment, a little girl suddenly appeared in front of White Robe.
Xiao Qi!
Ye Xuan looked at Xiao Qi and was stunned. He said, "Xiao Qi, didn't you go to the Third Dimension?"
Xiao Qi glanced at Ye Xuan. "You're back!"
Ye Xuan blinked. "Can you win?"
Xiao Qi said, "I'll give it a try!"
As soon as she finished speaking, she turned around and slashed with her sword.
This slash caused White Robe's brows to instantly knit together.
It was a very powerful strike!
In the distance, Bai Dizi's expression instantly sank!
Where did this little girl come from?
Very quickly, Xiao Qi and White Robe started fighting. The two of them were evenly matched!
It had to be said that Ye Xuan was a little shocked. Xiao Qi was actually so strong!
At this moment, Bai Dizi suddenly looked at Ye Xuan. "Letting someone stall White Robe and Zhen Wu. Obviously, there is someone else, right?"
Ye Xuan shook his head. "There is no one else!"
Bai Dizi stared at Ye Xuan. "Then, is everything going to end?"
Ye Xuan smiled. "Bai Dizi, I'll give you a big gift!"
With that, he sent Nian Nian into the Prison Pagoda.
After Nian Nian returned to the Prison Pagoda, Ye Xuan slowly closed his eyes.
Bai Dizi stared at Ye Xuan. He slowly clenched his fists!
As for the Sir Gods behind him, they were extremely vigilant!
Against Ye Xuan, they naturally did not dare to be careless!
At this moment, there was a sudden "pfft" sound from behind Ye Xuan's buttocks.
Everyone was stunned!
The next moment, everyone's expression turned extremely ugly!
Bullsh * t!
Ye Xuan was farting!
At this moment, Ye Xuan took a deep breath. He looked at Bai Dizi and smiled. "This fart is my gift to you. Do you like it?"
Bai Dizi looked at Ye Xuan calmly. "Attack!"
The God Lords behind him dashed toward Ye Xuan as soon as he finished speaking.
These God Lords were extremely fast. In a blink of an eye, they arrived in front of Ye Xuan. At this moment, Ye Xuan's lips curled up. The next moment, hundreds of thousands of energy swords flew out of his body!
These energy swords were condensed from turbid gas!
When he saw the energy swords, Bai Dizi's expression changed. "Retreat!
Retreat quickly! "
However, it was too late!
The dozen God Lords who were charging at the front were turned into beehives by the energy swords!
Even Dao Attainment Realm experts did not dare to belittle the turbid gas. How could Dao Manipulation Realm experts withstand it?
More than a dozen Divine Lords were caught off guard and were killed immediately. As for the remaining Divine Lords, they reacted quickly and retreated rapidly. This retreat took them tens of thousands of feet away!
At this moment, hundreds of thousands of energy swords were circling around Ye Xuan.
Bai Dizi looked at Ye Xuan in disbelief. "This … this is the turbid gas of Dark World!
He is not afraid of the turbid gas! "
Ye Xuan smiled. "Are you surprised?"
With that, he suddenly disappeared. The next moment, hundreds of thousands of energy swords slashed at Bai Dizi and the rest like a storm!
The expressions of the Divine Monarchs and Dao Vindication experts changed drastically when they saw this scene!
If it was just the energy swords, they would not be afraid at all. Ye Xuan's current strength was not enough to kill a Dao Validation Realm expert with energy swords. Moreover, he was controlling so many energy swords!
However, this was no ordinary sword qi!
It was turbid gas!
Not to mention Dao Validation Realm experts, even Dao Attainment Realm experts did not dare to touch the turbid gas. Once they did, they would immediately enter the Heavenly Decay Stage Five and die!
Bai Dizi did not hesitate. "Retreat!
Everyone retreat immediately! "
After receiving the order, the Dao Attainment Realm experts and Dao Validation Realm experts retreated rapidly. It didn't take long for them to leave the Fifth Dimension.
At this moment, White Robe and Zhen Wu stopped as well. When they looked at Ye Xuan, their eyes were solemn.
Turbid gas!
The reason why the Daoting Realm and the Dao Tomb could not be fully developed was because of the turbid gas. Not to mention ordinary Daoting experts, even the two of them did not dare to belittle the turbid gas!
But they did not expect that Ye Xuan was not afraid of the turbid gas. Moreover, he had condensed the turbid gas into swords!
How did he do it?
Bai Dizi stared fixedly at Ye Xuan. "How is it possible that he is not afraid of the turbid gas!"
Ye Xuan said with a smile, "Guess!"
Bai Dizi looked at Ye Xuan for a moment, and then he smiled. "Ye Xuan, you have really given us all a pleasant surprise!
A great surprise! "
Ye Xuan suddenly pointed with his fingers, and a strand of sword qi slashed directly at Bai Dizi. The moment the sword qi flew out, Bai Dizi had already appeared tens of thousands of meters away!
Ye Xuan was silent when he saw this.
Damn it!
This old fart was not good at fighting, but his escaping skills were the fastest he had seen so far!
Bai Dizi suddenly said, "Let's go!"
With that, he turned and left.
White Robe and Zhen Wu followed him.
In the starry sky, Ye Xuan slowly closed his eyes.
He knew that this matter was not over!
The next time the Daoting came, it would not be the Dao Attainment Realm!
The Dao Attainment Realm!
Currently, the greatest threat to Ye Xuan was the Dao Attainment Realm!
In the Heaven Abyss, even though the Dao Attainment Realm old man was afraid of the turbid gas, he was not especially afraid. However, he did not dare go deep into the Heaven Abyss because it was filled with turbid gas!
But Ye Xuan was unable to fill the entire Fifth Dimension with turbid gas!
Meanwhile, Xiao Qi appeared by Ye Xuan's side. "What do you plan to do next?"
Ye Xuan looked at Xiao Qi. "Protect the Fifth Dimension for me!"
Xiao Qi nodded. "Alright!"
Ye Xuan looked at the black clothed man, and the latter hesitated for a moment before he said, "I have already helped!"
Ye Xuan tapped with his finger, and a spatial ring appeared in front of the black clothed man. Within the spatial ring were over 10,000 Fortune Divine Crystals!
Ye Xuan looked at the black clothed man. "Senior, 10,000 Fortune Divine Crystals for each time you help. Will you do it or not?"
The black clothed man was slightly hesitant.
At this time, Ye Xuan tapped with his finger again, and a spatial ring appeared in front of the black clothed man.
Inside were twenty thousand fortune divine crystals!
The black clothed man put away the two spatial rings. "I will live and die with the Fifth Dimension!
The Daoting and I are absolutely irreconcilable! "
Ye Xuan, "…"
.....
PS: I am not asking for tickets, because I know that there are no more!!









Chapter 1400
Ye Xuan shook his head and smiled when he heard the black clothed man.
The Fortune Divine Crystals were great treasures!
Even an expert like the black clothed man couldn't refuse them!
However, it made sense. The Fortune Divine Crystals were practically controlled by the Daoting and the Dao Tomb, so it was extremely difficult for outsiders to obtain them.
Ye Xuan frowned when he thought up to this point.
He had a few tens of millions of Fortune Divine Crystals!
He didn't just have a few tens of millions of Fortune Divine Crystals, he even had a few super top-grade mines!
A conservative estimate was that these mines produced at least five to six million Fortune Divine Crystals every year!
Since it was like that, why didn't he recruit more Dao Controlling Realm experts?
Even though the Daoting was powerful, there would definitely be brave people who would come to the Fifth Dimension with great rewards!
So long as the price was right, then there would definitely be people who would come to the Fifth Dimension!
Thinking up to this point, Ye Xuan immediately called Guan Yin over. He thought for a moment and then said, "Guan Yin, write a recruitment order for me. Just say that as long as any expert at the Dao Corroboration or Dao Defense Realm comes to the Fifth Dimension to help, Dao Corroboration Realm experts will be given 10,000 Fortune Divine Crystals for every time they help. Dao Corroboration Realm experts will be given 3,000 Fortune Divine Crystals for every time they help!"
Guan Yin glanced at Ye Xuan and nodded. "Alright!"
She turned around and left once she finished speaking.
Ye Xuan gazed at the black clothed man. "Senior, what's your name?"
The black clothed man hesitated for a moment and said, "Li Zuo!"
Ye Xuan nodded. "Senior Li Zuo, do you know any other formidable experts?"
Li Zuo thought for a moment and said, "I do know one or two!"
Ye Xuan was delighted. "Senior Li Zuo, can you call them over?"
Li Zuo fell silent.
Ye Xuan smiled. "I won't force them!"
Li Zuo shook his head. "I'll give it a try!"
Ye Xuan hurriedly cupped his fists. "Thank you!"
As soon as he finished speaking, he turned around and left.
Li Zuo gazed at Ye Xuan from afar, and no one knew what he was thinking.
In truth, he hadn't stayed behind for the Fortune Divine Crystal. This thing was very important to him, but it wasn't the real reason he had stayed behind!
The reason why he stayed was because he wanted to form a good relationship!
Others might not know this guy's background, but he did!
That azure-robed man from back then was so powerful that it made people despair!
It was truly hopeless!
Even at his current level, he still felt hopeless every time he thought of the green-robed man!
A moment later, Li Zuo turned around and left.
...
Somewhere in the starry sky, Luo Hou and the others were silent.
They were present when Daoting came to the Fifth Dimension.
At this moment, Luo Hou and the others wore extremely solemn expressions.
Ye Xuan was not afraid of the turbid air!
Moreover, he had even condensed the turbid air into a sword!
This was something they had never expected!
Meanwhile, Bitter King spoke abruptly, "He went to the depths of the Dark Dimension!"
Luo Hou nodded, "The commotion in the Dark World must have something to do with him!"
Zhan Man's expression was cold, "He must have obtained countless fortune divine crystals!"
Suddenly, Qing Yaoyao said, "Don't worry about the Fortune Divine Crystals!
You should be wondering why he could go to the depths of the Dark World and not fear the turbid gas! "
Zhan Man was silent.
Luo Hou looked at Qing Yaoyao, "What do you think?"
Qing Yaoyao looked down at the Fifth Dimension and said softly, "Haven't you noticed?
He can always do things that we think are impossible! "
Luo Hou and the others were silent.
Ever since they met Ye Xuan, Ye Xuan was too mysterious!
Even he, Luo Hou, did not dare to enter the Dark World with the turbid air!
And this guy had clearly entered the depths of the Dark World!
Not only did he enter, but he was also not afraid of the turbid air!
This guy had condensed the turbid air into a sword!
This guy's body could not only absorb swords, but also the turbid air?
At this moment, Qing Yaoyao suddenly said, "What do you think Daoting will do next?"
Daoting!
Luo Hou said softly, "They will definitely not give up!
If I am not wrong, the Dao Ancestor should be coming out soon! "
Qing Yaoyao shook her head, "Not enough!
A Dao Ancestor cannot destroy the current Fifth Dimension! "
Luo Hou looked at Qing Yaoyao, "Why?"
Chi Yaoyao said, "Do you think Ye Xuan is afraid of a Dao Attainment expert?"
Luo Hou and the others were silent.
At this moment, Chi Yaoyao said, "Actually, we have two choices. The first is to wait and see, then reap the benefits.
The second is to help Ye Xuan. "
Bitter King looked at Qing Yaoyao, "What about the benefits?"
Qing Yaoyao glanced at Bitter King, "Benefits?
Why do you only care about the benefits in front of you? "
With that, she turned and disappeared into the horizon.
In the field, Luo Hou was silent.
Help Ye Xuan?
It was not that he had not thought of it, but the risk was too great!
The current situation was the most stable for the Dao Burial Mound!
...
Inside the Sword Hall, Ye Xuan and Nian Nian sat side by side.
Grilled fish!
Nian Nian stared at the golden grilled fish in front of her, her saliva almost flowing out!
She spent most of her time with Ye Xuan roasting fish.
In fact, she did not know why she liked eating fish!
She just liked it!
Although Ye Xuan was roasting fish, his thoughts had already drifted outside the hall.
At this moment, Nian Nian suddenly said, "How can I recover my memories?"
Ye Xuan retracted his thoughts and looked at Nian Nian, "You want to recover your memories?"
Nian Nian nodded and said softly, "Once I recover my memories, I can help you!"
Ye Xuan was stunned, then smiled and said, "It's okay, I can still bear it!"
Nian Nian lowered her head slightly and did not speak.
Ye Xuan gently rubbed Nian Nian's little head, "Do you know?
You've done enough for this world!
You have let down the entire Five-Dimensional Universe!
You have already handed the heavy responsibility of protecting the Five-Dimensional Universe to me!
Then let me bear it! "
Nian Nian was about to speak when Ye Xuan suddenly smiled and said, "Your fish is ready!"
Nian Nian looked at the roasted fish and sniffed it with her nose. Then, she revealed an intoxicated expression. Soon, she tore off a piece of fish and placed it in front of Ye Xuan's mouth.
Ye Xuan laughed.
He was really enjoying every moment he spent with Nian Nian!
As if thinking of something, Ye Xuan glanced at Jia Lou in the pagoda. When he saw Jia Lou, he was stunned. Gradually, the corners of his mouth curled up slightly.
Jia Lou was going to succeed!
If Jia Lou cultivated a Dao Body, then she would definitely be able to block a Dao Attainment Realm expert!
And Daoting had two Dao Attainment Realm experts!
Thinking of this, the smile on Ye Xuan's face gradually disappeared.
For now, the Five-Dimensional Universe still did not have a good chance of winning!
It was not enough!
He had to reach the Dao Attainment Realm!
Thinking of this, Ye Xuan got up and left with Nian Nian.
The best way to improve was to fight!
....
Daoting.
At this time, the atmosphere in Daoting was extremely solemn.
This time, almost all of Daoting's forces had attacked. However, not only did they not gain an advantage, but Ye Xuan had also killed more than a dozen Dao Attainment Realm experts!
Turbid Qi!
Ye Xuan could actually control Turbid Qi!
It had to be said that this made many of Daoting's experts extremely afraid!
In a large hall, basically all of Daoting's experts were gathered here!
Everyone in the hall was at the Dao Attainment Realm!
Leading them were Bai Dizi, Zhen Wu, and White Robe!
At this moment, an old man suddenly said softly, "How can he absorb the Turbid Qi?
Where's the Turbid Qi? "
Absorb Turbid Qi!
In the hall, everyone looked at Bai Dizi!
In fact, there was still some resentment in everyone's hearts. Bai Dizi's intelligence skills were not good enough!
Bai Dizi was silent.
He did not know that Ye Xuan could absorb Turbid Qi.
Why was this guy not afraid of Turbid Qi?
Bai Dizi was puzzled no matter how he thought about it.
Zhen Wu suddenly said, "Bai Dizi, aren't you going to say something?"
Bai Dizi said softly, "Every time I think I understand him, he gives me a new surprise …"
As he spoke, he shook his head with a bitter feeling in his heart.
He had never underestimated Ye Xuan, but Ye Xuan would always surprise him.
Just like this time, he'd thought that the people behind Ye Xuan would show up, but they didn't!
Ye Xuan had used the Turbid Qi to drive them away!
Even Dao Attainment Realm experts didn't dare to underestimate Turbid Qi!
How could Ye Xuan not be afraid of Turbid Qi?
Meanwhile, the white robed man spoke abruptly, "Don't forget 2 things. The 1st is that Mu Niannian. Even though she's temporarily lost her memories and strength, destroying our Dao Court would be as easy as flicking her finger once she recovers her memories!"
Everyone was silent.
Once Mu Niannian regained her memories, Daoting would be finished immediately!
Because the Five-Dimensional Universe no longer needed Mu Niannian to suppress it. Once Mu Niannian regained her memories, it would mean that her strength would reach its peak, the true peak!
At that time, Daoting would be like a chicken in front of her!
At this moment, White Robe spoke again, "The second thing is Ye Xuan. Once he reaches Dao Attainment Realm, the price we have to pay to kill him will be more than 10 times higher than it is now!"
Everyone was silent.
Once Ye Xuan reached Dao Attainment Realm, it could be said that even if White Robe and Zhen Wu joined forces, they might not be able to do anything to him!
At this moment, Bai Dizi suddenly said, "Wait!"
Everyone looked at Bai Dizi, and Bai Dizi said solemnly, "At most 5 days, the Tao Ancestor will come out of seclusion!"
Tao Ancestor!
Hearing this, everyone's expression instantly relaxed!
That was the true backbone of Daoting!
Meanwhile, a sword howl suddenly resounded from outside the hall. In the next moment, everyone raised their heads and looked over. A young man was walking slowly towards the southern gate with a sword in his hand!
Ye Xuan!
The expressions of all the experts within the hall instantly changed when they saw Ye Xuan!
What's this fellow doing here?
In the next moment, all the experts within the hall had appeared at the southern gate!
In an instant, all of them surrounded Ye Xuan!
Ye Xuan glanced at the Daoting experts that had suddenly appeared around him, and he smiled, "So many of you?"
Bai Dizi gazed at Ye Xuan and said, "What? You intend to fight all of us by yourself?"
Ye Xuan opened his palm. In the next moment, countless energy swords condensed from Death Energy appeared around him. All the experts of Daoting retreated explosively when they witnessed this scene!
The expressions of Bai Dizi and the others instantly became solemn!
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "Don't run. I've come here this time to ask for a favor from all of you!"
Bai Dizi frowned slightly and said, "Ask for our help?
Are you sure? "
Ye Xuan nodded, "I've been at the Dao Control Realm for too long, and I want to break through!
I want all of you to help me! "
Bai Dizi gazed at Ye Xuan and said, "Have you gone mad?"
Ye Xuan gazed at Zhen Wu and said, "Zhen Wu, I've never fought you in the past. Now, let's fight again!"
Zhen Wu gazed at Ye Xuan and said, "You want to fight me, and then charge into the Dao Control Realm!"
Ye Xuan nodded and said, "I won't utilize foul energy!"
Zhen Wu stared fixedly at Ye Xuan and said, "Do you think I'll agree?"
Ye Xuan pointed at the white robed figures and said, "Both of you attack me together!"
Attack him together!
Everyone in the surroundings was stunned!
....
