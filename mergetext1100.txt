Chapter 1401
Together!
No one expected Ye Xuan to challenge Zhen Wu and White Robe!
One against two!
Was Ye Xuan crazy?
Although Ye Xuan was a genius, Zhen Wu and the white-robed man could be said to be the strongest people in the Dao Court who had achieved the Dao.
And now he wanted to fight one against two?
Zhen Wu looked at Ye Xuan without saying a word.
Beside him, White Robe kept silent with his eyes closed.
Ye Xuan smiled. "Why, are you refusing?"
Zhen Wu looked at Ye Xuan in silence.
At this moment, Bai Dizi's voice suddenly sounded in Zhen Wu's mind. "This person must have something to rely on!"
Zhen Wu said in a low voice, "But this is also our chance!
A chance to kill him!
Isn't that right? "
Bai Dizi was silent.
If Zhen Wu and White Robe joined forces, they would have a chance to kill Ye Xuan!
But if they couldn't kill him!
It was very likely that Ye Xuan would reach Dao Defense!
At this moment, White Robe suddenly opened his eyes. "Why think so much?
Let's just fight! "
As his voice fell, he suddenly rushed forward. The next moment, a silver light appeared half an inch between Ye Xuan's eyebrows!
The reason why it didn't pierce through was because a sword had pierced the body of that spear!
Seeing that his attack had missed, White Robe suddenly swept his spear horizontally.
Swoosh!
With a sweep, space was torn apart!
Ye Xuan blocked it with his sword.
Boom!
Under the spear, Ye Xuan instantly retreated hundreds of feet away!
But just as he stopped, a silver spear pierced through the air.
Ye Xuan straightened his sword and slashed forward.
Boom!
A wave of sword light exploded in the field!
Ye Xuan retreated hundreds of feet again!
Before he stopped, a shadow suddenly appeared in front of him. Then, a silver spear instantly reached his throat!
As fast as lightning!
Ye Xuan's expression was calm. Just as the spear was about to pierce his throat, his body suddenly leaned back, and at the same time, the sword in his hand suddenly flew out.
Chi!
The sword brought with it a sword light that looked like a crescent moon.
White Robe suddenly withdrew his spear and slammed it down.
Boom!
Ye Xuan's sword was directly hit, and the powerful force sent the sword flying. Ye Xuan himself took the opportunity to retreat a thousand feet away. The moment he stopped, he stretched out his right hand, and the sword that was sent flying by the white robe landed firmly in his palm.
In the distance, the white-robed man stood with a spear in his hand. He was dressed in white robes and had a silver spear in his hand. He looked like a god of war.
Zhen Wu did not intervene.
Whether it was him or White Robe, both of them had their own pride!
As long as Ye Xuan didn't play any dirty tricks, they wouldn't choose to gang up on Ye Xuan!
Arrogance!
They had fought countless battles in their lives, so why would they fear Ye Xuan?
At this moment, White Robe suddenly took a step forward. With each step, he struck with his spear. The space in front of Ye Xuan suddenly cracked open. Following that, a silver light flashed out!
The spear arrived before the man!
Ye Xuan did not block it. Instead, he stabbed with his sword!
This time, he chose to fight head-on!
Boom!
The sword light shattered, and Ye Xuan retreated more than ten feet. However, White Robe also retreated more than three hundred feet with his spear!
Ye Xuan actually gained the upper hand in this head-on confrontation!
Not far away, Bai Dizi frowned slightly. "How is this possible …"
At this moment, Zhen Wu suddenly said, "His strength is different from before!"
Strength!
Ye Xuan's current strength was naturally different from before!
He had absorbed the blood of the entire Naga Dragon clan!
He now possessed the strength of the Naga Dragon clan!
In terms of pure strength, perhaps only Jia Lou could compete with him!
At this moment, Bai Dizi's voice suddenly sounded in Zhen Wu's mind. "When he fights with White Robe later, if you ambush him, how confident are you of killing him?"
Hearing this, Zhen Wu frowned slightly. He looked at Bai Dizi. "What do you mean!"
Bai Dizi's face was extremely gloomy. "Zhen Wu, I know you have your pride, but you have to know that this Ye Xuan …"
Zhen Wu suddenly shook his head. "Bai Dizi, I know that in your heart, you have always wanted Ye Xuan to die. I also want him to die. However, I will not ambush him.
Now, it is a fair battle between him and White Robe. "
Bai Dizi stared at Zhen Wu. "Zhen Wu, don't be pedantic!
I beg you! "
Zhen Wu looked at Ye Xuan in the distance and said softly, "It's not pedantic. It's the bottom line!"
Bai Dizi still wanted to say something. At this moment, Ye Xuan suddenly rushed towards White Robe with his sword in hand.
Bai Dizi's face was extremely ugly.
If Zhen Wu suddenly ambushed him, he had a high chance of killing Ye Xuan!
However, Zhen Wu was too pedantic!
Bottom line?
Bai Dizi also wanted to have a bottom line. However, between the bottom line and Daoting's life and death, he chose the latter.
As if he had thought of something, he suddenly looked at a Sir God on his right. At this moment, Zhen Wu's voice suddenly rang in his head. "Bai Dizi, I, Daoting, am I a sore loser?"
Bai Dizi looked at Zhen Wu. Zhen Wu said softly, "Even if we lose, let us lose with some dignity, okay?"
Bai Dizi was silent.
Zhen Wu said again, "Let them fight. If White Robe loses, I won't say anything if you choose to gang up on him. But now, let them fight fairly. I believe that White Robe will choose the same."
Bai Dizi was still silent.
Zhen Wu looked at Bai Dizi. "Daoting is my belief. I will fight for this belief until the end. I know that Daoting is your belief too. However, we cannot throw away our bottom line for our belief!"
Bai Dizi sighed softly.
Zhen Wu did not say anything else. He looked into the distance. At this moment, Ye Xuan and White Robe's battle was very intense!
Actually, he was feeling rather emotional!
Back when Ye Xuan had just gone to Celestial Abyss, Ye Xuan was not his match. But now, Ye Xuan's strength was no weaker than his and White Robe's!
Ye Xuan's growth was really too fast!
Boom!
At this moment, an explosion suddenly sounded. Under everyone's gaze, White Robe was forced back nearly a hundred feet by Ye Xuan's sword.
White Robe had just stopped when he suddenly soared into the sky. The next moment, he held the silver spear in his hand and threw it at Ye Xuan.
The spear was like a raging dragon emerging from the sea, piercing through heaven and earth!
Below, Ye Xuan's expression was calm. Before the spear reached him, the space around him was already distorted!
The momentum of the spear was too strong!
When the spear arrived above Ye Xuan, Ye Xuan suddenly transformed into a ray of light that shot into the sky.
Bang!
A world shaking explosion suddenly resounded, and then the space in an area of over 100km cracked apart!
In midair, Ye Xuan held his sword firmly against the spear!
The energy within the spear hadn't vanished completely!
The glow on Ye Xuan's sword was growing dimmer and dimmer!
Right at this moment, White Robe suddenly appeared in the sky above the spear, and then he stomped his right foot against the tip of the spear.
Bang!
Ye Xuan descended straight down from midair while the tip of the spear was constantly pressing against the tip of Ye Xuan's sword. So, White Robe's energy was ceaselessly suppressing Ye Xuan!
Right at this moment, Ye Xuan suddenly stomped his right foot against the ground. In the next moment, the Sword Domain suddenly appeared here. At the same time, he swiftly slashed his sword forward.
Bang!
Ye Xuan stopped. In the next moment, White Robe retreated explosively by 300m!
After White Robe stopped, he gazed at Ye Xuan with eyes that were filled with battle intent!
Fight!
Ye Xuan's eyes were filled with battle intent as well!
Since he'd absorbed the dragon's blood and cultivated his body into the Dao Body, he'd rarely fought. But now, he wanted to fight to his heart's content!
Ye Xuan walked towards White Robe with his sword in hand!
His blood started to surge within him.
However, he didn't release the energy of his bloodline!
Not only did he not release the energy of his bloodline, he didn't even expose his Dao Body!
White Robe gazed at Ye Xuan from afar while he held the silver spear tightly in his right hand. The silver spear in his hand started to tremble violently, and a monstrous aura enveloped the surroundings!
The aura of the spear was overwhelming!
Right at this moment, Ye Xuan suddenly vanished on the spot. White Robe's face was expressionless as he suddenly stabbed the spear in his right hand forward.
Bang!
A ray of sword light was forced to stop by this spear strike!
The space around White Robe and Ye Xuan transformed into nothingness at this moment, whereas, White Robe and Ye Xuan separated from each other at this moment, and both of them retreated explosively by over 1km.
As Ye Xuan was flying backwards, a flying sword suddenly slashed towards White Robe!
White Robe stabbed forward in midair.
Bang!
The flying sword was blocked. However, in the next moment, Ye Xuan suddenly appeared in front of the flying sword. He grabbed the sword and slashed forward with great force.
When this strike descended, the expressions of everyone here changed drastically!
Including White Robe!
Dao Sword!
This strike wasn't an ordinary sword technique any longer, but a Dao Sword!
It was also the first time Ye Xuan had executed a Dao Sword since he'd cultivated the Dao Sword!
This strike shook the heavens and the earth!
White Robe's eyes revealed a solemn expression for the first time as he stood before Ye Xuan. He held the spear with both hands and swiftly swept it horizontally, causing a strand of domineering spear energy to sweep out. But in the next moment, this spear energy was directly slashed into pieces by Ye Xuan's strike!
Bang!
Under the gazes of everyone, White Robe instantly retreated explosively by 3km, whereas, the space in an area of 3km in front of Ye Xuan had been transformed into nothingness!
This strike had forcefully obliterated this expanse of space!
Nearby, a wisp of blood slowly seeped out from the corner of White Robe's mouth.
Moreover, countless cracks had appeared on the silver spear in his hand!
The surroundings suddenly fell silent!
White Robe was at a complete disadvantage in this collision!
In the distance, Ye Xuan walked slowly towards White Robe with his sword in hand.
Meanwhile, a trace of viciousness flashed through White Robe's eyes, and then he suddenly leaped up. At this moment, his entire body became illusory, and the silver spear in his hand suddenly trembled violently!
At a disadvantage, Ye Xuan suddenly leaped up and slashed with his sword!
Dao Sword!
With this slash, the space around Ye Xuan instantly became illusory!
Meanwhile, White Robe suddenly stabbed down with his spear.
It was a tit for tat!
Both of them had executed their strongest attacks!
Bang!
As soon as the spear and sword came into contact, the space in an area of over 100km around the southern gate was forcefully obliterated. On the other hand, Ye Xuan and White Robe retreated explosively, and they retreated for over 10km!
As soon as Ye Xuan stopped, the space in an area of 3km behind him was instantly transformed into nothingness!
Ye Xuan was first stunned, and then he hurriedly fell to the ground. He held his chest with both hands as if he was about to die!
Actually, he was completely fine because his body had forcefully withstood all the force of White Robe's attack!
However, he didn't want to expose his Dao Physique!
In the distance, White Robe was quite heavily injured as well. However, he didn't fall, and he stood there with his spear in hand.
Meanwhile, White Robe suddenly charged towards Ye Xuan with his spear in hand!
Obviously, he wanted to put an end to Ye Xuan right away!
Now that Ye Xuan was heavily injured, it was the best time to kill him!
Under everyone's gazes, Ye Xuan clutched his chest as blood flowed incessantly from his mouth, and he seemed to be on the verge of death.
White Robe was getting closer and closer to Ye Xuan …
...







Chapter 1402
Just as White Robe was several feet away from Ye Xuan, White Robe suddenly stopped!
White Robe stared at Ye Xuan, "Stop pretending!"
Ye Xuan did not react and still looked like he was about to die!
White Robe just stared at Ye Xuan, he did not choose to attack again!
After a moment, seeing that White Robe did not attack, Ye Xuan sat up. He looked at White Robe and thought it was a pity!
This guy actually did not fall for it!
White Robe looked at Ye Xuan, "If you were really that weak, you would not have come to challenge me!"
Saying that, he slowly closed his eyes, "Ye Xuan, if you want to kill me, there is only one way, and that is to kill me openly. You want to kill me?
Then you might be thinking too much! "
Ye Xuan chuckled, "Then I will kill you openly!"
As soon as he finished speaking, he suddenly leaped up with his sword in hand, and then he swiftly slashed down!
Dao Sword!
At the same time that the sword slashed down, a mysterious force suddenly enveloped White Robe!
Sword Domain!
White Robe was expressionless as he stabbed out with his spear!
Boom!
Heaven and earth trembled!
Under everyone's gaze, White Robe retreated rapidly!
Not far away, Bai Dizi and the others did not look good.
Because Ye Xuan could already suppress White Robe!
He did not rely on battle techniques, but purely on strength and that Dao Sword!
If it were anyone else, they would definitely not be able to continuously use such a powerful sword technique, but Ye Xuan could!
Because his fleshly body was really strong enough!
The battle became more and more intense, and the blood in Ye Xuan's body gradually boiled. However, he was still suppressing his bloodline power!
This bloodline power was too abnormal. Unless it was a desperate situation, he would usually not use it!
In the distance, Bai Dizi suddenly looked at Zhen Wu, "He is getting stronger as he fights!"
Zhen Wu was silent.
He also realized this problem!
Ye Xuan was getting stronger as he fought!
In other words, Ye Xuan had just broken through. Right now, Ye Xuan was using battle to stimulate his potential!
Bai Dizi said softly, "If this continues, I don't know if White Robe will lose, but I do know that this Ye Xuan will become stronger and stronger. He might even reach the Dao Manipulation Realm!"
Obviously, he still wanted Zhenwu to sneak up on Ye Xuan!
Now that Ye Xuan was being forced by the white-robed man, as long as Zhenwu chose to launch a sneak attack, there was a great chance that he could kill Ye Xuan.
In the field, only Zhen Wu had a good chance to kill Ye Xuan!
Zhen Wu fell silent.
Bai Dizi sighed softly. "Zhenwu, I know you're proud, but have you ever thought that once this person reaches the Imperial Dao, even a Dao Ancestor wouldn't be able to kill him so easily!
You have to know that he has yet to unleash his full strength. Putting everything else aside, he has yet to use the power of his bloodline. What does this mean?
It means that once he uses the power of his bloodline, White Robe will most likely lose. "
Zhen Wu slowly closed his eyes!
And the sword in his hand kept trembling!
Bai Dizi continued, "Zhenwu, if we don't get rid of Ye Xuan today, I, Daoting, will be destroyed by this person in the future!
Ye Xuan is a despicable person. There's no need for us to talk about fairness with him!
Moreover, he is challenging you and White Robe. There's nothing wrong with you making a move! "
After a long silence, Zhen Wu looked at Ye Xuan in the distance and said softly, "If I make a move, it means that I, Daoting, will lose the last bit of pride and dignity!"
Bai Dizi was about to speak when Zhen Wu suddenly said, "Bai Dizi, do you know why the Great Dao collapsed all those years ago?"
Bai Dizi looked at Zhen Wu. Zhen Wu said softly, "Because we are unscrupulous!
Our Dao Court is unscrupulous in everything we do. It is because of Ru Chu that the world has appeared.
Qingcheng, Ye Clan, Ancestral Hall.
"Ancestors, Ye Xuan has no talent, no virtue … From now on, Ye Xuan's position as Crown Prince will be replaced by Ye Lang."
The one who spoke was an old man in a black robe.
Not far behind the old man stood a youth with a faint smile on his face.
This person was Ye Lang.
On both sides were the Ye Clan's Elders.
"Why!?"
At this time, a timid voice suddenly rang out in the ancestral hall.
Everyone turned to look and saw a little girl standing at the door. She was about 12 or 13 years old, and her hands were tightly gripping the hem of her skirt. Her face had a sickly pallor, and she looked a little weak. There was even a hint of fear in her eyes.
This little girl was called Ye Ling, Ye Xuan's younger sister. When she heard that the clan wanted to remove Ye Xuan, she rushed over despite her illness.
The black-robed old man frowned, "Ye Ling, what are you doing!?"
The little girl called Ye Ling bowed to the people in the ancestral hall, and said timidly, "Great Elder, my brother Ye Xuan is a Crown Prince, why did you discard him for no reason?"
The Great Elder looked at Ye Ling coldly, "This is a matter of the clan, why are you interrupting?
Leave! "
Ye Ling was obviously afraid, not daring to look at the Great Elder, but she did not leave. Instead, she plucked up her courage and entered the ancestral hall. She bowed again to the Elders on both sides, "Dear Elders, my brother is fighting with the Li Clan over the mining rights at Nanshan. He is fighting for the clan, and we don't know if he's dead or alive. Yet, the clan is using a groundless excuse to discard his position. This is really unfair."
"Impudent!"
The Great Elder suddenly raged, "Discard him or not, it's not up to a little girl like you to decide.
Men, drag her away! "
At this moment, the new Crown Prince Ye Lang suddenly laughed, "You should be flogged thirty times as a warning to others!"
The Great Elder said coldly, "Then flog thirty times!"
Soon, two guards of the Ye Clan rushed in.
Ye Ling clenched her fists, and said angrily, "This is unfair! My brother has risked his life for the clan for so many years, even now he is fighting for the clan, but the clan is so unfair to him …"
One of the guards glanced at the new Crown Prince Ye Lang, and he knew that this was his chance to show off.
The guard sneered, "Young Master Ye Lang inherits the position of Crown Prince, it's everyone's wish, why are you shouting?" As he said this, he raised his hand and slapped Ye Ling's face.
Slap!
A crisp slap sounded, and the right side of Ye Ling's face instantly turned red and swollen, but she did not cry, and just covered her cheek tightly.
Ye Lang looked at the guard, and smiled, "What's your name?"
The guard hurriedly bowed, "I'm Zhang Mu, greeting the Crown Prince."
Ye Lang nodded, "You're not bad. After I become the Crown Prince, I need ten guards, so you can be my guard from now on."
Hearing this, Zhang Mu was overjoyed, and hurriedly bowed deeply, "I'm willing to go through fire and water for the Crown Prince, even if I have to die ten thousand times!"
Ye Lang nodded slightly, "Drag him out, this person is disturbing the ancestral hall, don't show mercy, understand?"
Zhang Mu glanced at Ye Lang, and when he saw the murderous intent in Ye Lang's eyes, he understood.
Immediately, he grabbed Ye Ling's hair and dragged her out.
At this moment, Zhang Mu seemed to have seen something, and suddenly stopped.
In the ancestral hall, everyone turned their heads to look outside.
Not far from the ancestral hall, a young man was walking towards the ancestral hall. The young man was wearing a tight-fitting robe, and the robe was tattered, and there was blood everywhere.
This person was Ye Xuan, who had rushed back from the South Mountain!
Seeing Ye Xuan, Ye Lang's mouth curled into a cold smile.
Inside the ancestral hall, the Elders frowned.
The Great Elder narrowed his eyes, and his expression was frighteningly gloomy. No one knew what he was thinking.
From afar, when Ye Xuan saw Zhang Mu dragging Ye Ling, his face turned savage, "Who gave you the guts to touch my sister?"
When Zhang Mu saw Ye Xuan, his face changed, and he quickly looked at Ye Lang. Just as he was about to speak, Ye Xuan suddenly leaped in front of him like a ferocious tiger. Before the latter could react, Ye Xuan's fist landed on his face.
Peng!
Zhang Mu felt a wave of dizziness, and he stumbled and fell.
However, Ye Ling did not stop there. He charged towards Zhang Mu again. At this time, Ye Lang suddenly roared, "Ye Xuan, he's my man, how dare you …"
Ye Xuan suddenly stepped on Zhang Mu's chest.
Pu!
Zhang Mu spat out a mouthful of blood.
Seeing this, Ye Lang's face turned ugly. Ye Xuan lifted his head and looked at him, "Your man?"
As he spoke, he stepped on Zhang Mu's face.
Zhang Mu's face turned into a bloody mess, as he screamed, "Prince, save, save me …"
Ye Xuan did not care about Zhang Mu, as he walked to Ye Ling's side. Seeing Ye Ling's appearance, Ye Xuan felt as though his heart was being sliced by a knife. He clenched his fists, and his entire body trembled.
When Ye Ling saw Ye Xuan, her tears flowed out, "Brother, it hurts, it hurts …"
Hearing this, Ye Xuan's expression turned savage. In the next instant, he charged in front of Zhang Mu, and kicked Zhang Mu's head.
Peng!
Qingcheng, Ye Clan, Ancestral Hall.
"Ancestors, Ye Xuan has no talent, no virtue … From now on, Ye Xuan's position as Prince shall be replaced by Ye Lang."
The one who spoke was an old man in black robes.
Not far behind the old man, there was a youth with a faint smile on his face.
This person was Ye Lang.
On both sides were the Ye Clan's Elders.
"Why!?"
At this time, a timid voice rang out in the ancestral hall.
Everyone turned to look and saw a little girl standing at the door. She was about 12 or 13 years old, and her hands were tightly gripping the hem of her skirt. Her face had a sickly pallor, and she looked a little weak. There was even a trace of fear in her eyes.
This girl was called Ye Ling, and she was Ye Xuan's younger sister. When she heard that the clan wanted to remove Ye Xuan, she disregarded her illness and rushed over.
The black-robed old man frowned, "Ye Ling, what are you doing!?"
The little girl called Ye Ling bowed to the people in the ancestral hall, and said timidly, "Great Elder, my brother Ye Xuan is a Prince, why did you discard him for no reason?"
The Great Elder looked at Ye Ling coldly, "This is a matter of the clan, why are you interrupting?
Leave! "
Ye Ling was clearly a little fearful. She did not dare to look the Great Elder in the eye, but she did not leave. Instead, she mustered up her courage and walked into the ancestral hall. She bowed to the elders on both sides of the hall and said, "Elders, my brother is currently fighting with the Li family for the mining rights of the mine in Nanshan. He is now fighting for the family, and it is unknown whether he is alive or dead. However, the family has used a groundless excuse to remove his position as the Crown Prince.
"Impudent!"
The Great Elder suddenly raged, "Discard him or not, it's not up to a little girl like you to decide.
Men, drag her away. "
At this time, the new Prince, Ye Lang, suddenly laughed, "You should be flogged 30 times as a warning to others!"
The Great Elder replied coldly, "Then flog her 30 times!"
Soon, two guards of the Ye Clan rushed in.
Ye Ling clenched her fists and said angrily, "This is unfair. My brother has risked his life for the clan for so many years. Even now, he is risking his life for the clan. The clan is so unfair to him …"
One of the guards glanced at the new Prince, Ye Lang. He knew that this was his chance to shine.
The guard sneered, "Young Master Ye Lang inherits the position of Prince. What are you yelling about?" As he spoke, he raised his hand and slapped Ye Ling's face.
Slap!
A crisp slap sounded, and the right side of Ye Ling's face instantly swelled up. However, she did not cry. She only held her cheek tightly.
Ye Lang looked at the guard and smiled, "What's your name?"
The guard hurriedly bowed, "Subordinate Zhang Mu greets the Prince."
Ye Lang nodded, "You're not bad. After I become the Prince, I will need 10 guards. You can be my guard from now on."
Hearing this, Zhang Mu was overjoyed. He hurriedly bowed deeply, "This subordinate is willing to go through fire and water for the Prince!"
Ye Lang nodded, "Drag him away. This person is disturbing the ancestral hall. Don't hold back. Understood?"
Zhang Mu glanced at Ye Lang. When he saw the murderous intent in Ye Lang's eyes, he understood.
He immediately grabbed Ye Ling's hair and dragged her out.
At this moment, Zhang Mu seemed to see something and suddenly stopped.
In the ancestral hall, everyone turned their heads to look outside.
Not far from the ancestral hall, a young man was walking towards the ancestral hall. The young man was wearing a tight-fitting robe. The robe was tattered and covered in blood.
The young man was Ye Xuan, who had rushed back from Nanshan!
Seeing Ye Xuan, Ye Lang's lips curled into a sinister smile.
Inside the ancestral hall, the Elders frowned.
The Great Elder narrowed his eyes, his face dark and gloomy. No one knew what he was thinking.
From afar, when Ye Xuan saw Zhang Mu dragging Ye Ling, his face turned savage. "Who gave you the guts to touch my sister?"
When Zhang Mu saw Ye Xuan, his face changed. He hurriedly looked at Ye Lang and was about to speak. At this time, Ye Xuan was like a ferocious tiger leaping in front of him. Before the latter could react, Ye Xuan's fist landed on his face.
Peng!
Zhang Mu felt a wave of dizziness, and he stumbled and fell.
However, Ye Ling did not stop there. He charged towards Zhang Mu again. At this time, Ye Lang suddenly roared, "Ye Xuan, he's my man! How dare you …"
Ye Xuan suddenly stepped on Zhang Mu's chest.
Pu!
Zhang Mu spat out a mouthful of blood.
Seeing this, Ye Lang's face turned ugly. Ye Xuan looked up at him and snarled, "Your man?"
As he spoke, he stepped on Zhang Mu's face.
Zhang Mu's face turned into a bloody mess, as he screamed, "Prince, save, save me …"
Ye Xuan did not care about Zhang Mu, as he walked to Ye Ling's side. Seeing Ye Ling's state, Ye Xuan felt as though his heart was being cut by a knife. He clenched his fists, and his entire body trembled.
When Ye Ling saw Ye Xuan, her tears flowed, "Brother, it hurts, it hurts …"
Hearing this, Ye Xuan's expression turned savage. In the next instant, he charged in front of Zhang Mu and kicked Zhang Mu's head.
Peng!







Chapter 1403
Behind Bai Dizi stood a middle-aged man.
It was the Daoting Dao Ancestor!
Bai Dizi said, "Dao Ancestor, Zhenwu …"
The Dao Ancestor said, "This is his choice. Respect it!"
Bai Dizi sighed.
With Zhenwu's departure, the Daoting's strength was greatly reduced!
The Dao Ancestor looked into the depths of the starry sky. "Did you find the plain-dressed woman?"
Bai Dizi said, "Divine Wind and the others have been found!
But both of them are dead!
It seems that the plain-dressed woman is stronger than we imagined! "
The Dao Ancestor was silent.
Bai Dizi said, "Our top priority now is to deal with Mu Niannian!
She has lost her memory and has no strength. Now is the best time to kill her! "
Mu Niannian!
The Dao Ancestor turned to look in the direction of the Five-Dimensional Universe and said, "We should have destroyed her body and the Five-Dimensional Universe!"
As for that woman, he was also afraid of her.
It was that woman who had destroyed his body with less than 30% of her strength!
30% of her strength!
He had to admit that he was a little shocked at that time.
He was at the Dao Attainment Realm. Moreover, he was at the peak of the Dao Attainment Realm.
However, that woman had easily destroyed his body with only 30% of her strength!
In fact, during this period of seclusion, he had been thinking about how strong that woman was.
There was no answer!
There was no path above the Dao Attainment Realm.
At least for him, there was no path!
After a long time, the Dao Ancestor suddenly said, "Get ready!
I will go find that person! "
With that, he turned and left.
In the field, Bai Dizi was silent for a long time, then said softly, "Zhenwu, the Daoting Realm will become better!
The order of the Great Path will also be restored! "
With that, he turned and left.
....
The Dao Ancestor came to the Dao Tomb. On a mountain peak, the Dao Ancestor came to a cave.
The Dao Ancestor looked at the cave and said, "Senior Brother, are you still in seclusion?"
The stone door of the cave suddenly opened and a middle-aged man walked out!
Lord!
The Lord of the Dao Tomb!
If there were outsiders here, they would definitely be shocked!
Because the Dao Ancestor called him Senior Brother!
In fact, very few people knew that the Lord was once a Daoting. However, he later parted ways with the Daoting!
The Lord looked at the Dao Ancestor and smiled, "Junior Brother, how have you been?"
The Dao Ancestor was expressionless. "Looks like you didn't break through again!"
The Lord laughed, "It doesn't matter!"
The Dao Ancestor smiled and said, "Do you really not care?"
The Lord raised his head and looked deep into the starry sky. He smiled and said, "Junior Brother, during my seclusion, I suddenly realized something. It's meaningless!"
The Dao Ancestor frowned slightly. "What's meaningless?"
The Lord laughed, "Daoting battles with you are meaningless!"
The Dao Ancestor looked at the Great Lord. "What do you mean?"
The Lord laughed. "How strong do you think Mu Niannian is?"
The Dao Ancestor was silent.
Mu Niannian!
Just how strong was this woman?
He didn't know!
That woman's strength could be said to have exceeded his understanding!
The Lord continued, "Even if I subvert your Daoting, what's the point?
The Three Thousand Great Daos are just ants to some people in this world. "
Then, he looked at the Dao Ancestor and smiled, "I want to go to other places to see how big the universe is. I also want to see the strong from other places!
What about you? "
The Dao Ancestor was silent.
The Lord laughed, "I know that you want to kill Ye Xuan and that woman. Moreover, you want the Dao Scriptures!
Ye Xuan now has five scrolls, your Dao Court has two, and the Dao Tomb has one. If you get all of them, you will have eight Dao Scriptures. However, the last one is in the Saha World. Can you get it?
The Dao Ancestor whispered, "What if you get it?"
The Lord was silent.
Dao Scriptures!
What did it mean to gather the Dao Scriptures?
It meant to awaken the Dao Spirit …
One had to say, it was very tempting!
The Dao Ancestor looked at the Lord, "Senior Brother, aren't you tempted?"
The Lord laughed and didn't say anything.
The Dao Ancestor said, "Senior Brother, if we gather the Dao Scriptures and awaken the Dao Spirit, we will be able to reach the next level."
The Lord was silent.
The Dao Ancestor said, "Don't you want to see the complete version of the Dao Scriptures?"
The Lord looked at the Dao Ancestor, "That Ye Xuan is not simple!"
The Dao Ancestor smiled, "His biggest support is that Mu Niannian. That person has lost her memory. If we want to kill her, it will be easy, isn't it?"
The Lord asked, "What about the person behind him?"
The Dao Ancestor was silent.
Because until now, the Daoting still didn't know who was behind Ye Xuan.
The Lord smiled and said, "Let's not talk about the others. Let's talk about the woman in the plain dress. Junior Brother, what level do you think she is?"
The Dao Ancestor said, "Senior Brother, you have actually made a decision, right?"
The Lord smiled, "What decision?"
The Dao Ancestor looked at the Lord, "You will not give up on the Dao Scriptures!"
The Lord laughed, "Junior Brother, you have no choice because you have already become enemies with Ye Xuan. However, I have a choice because I have a good relationship with Ye Xuan in the Dao Tomb!
What do you think? "
The Dao Ancestor smiled, "Senior Brother, you said that you want to leave. Where are you going?
To the Ancient God Abyss? "
The Lord said, "Can't I?"
The Dao Ancestor looked at the Lord, "Are you going there to rely on others?"
The Lord's smile slowly disappeared.
The Dao Ancestor smiled and said, "Senior Brother, at this level, you and I can be said to have reached our limits. Although we are all geniuses, the Dao Attainment Realm is our limit. Not to mention us, wasn't Master the same back then?
To us, there is only one way to change our fate and reach the next level. That is to gather all the Dao Scriptures and awaken the Dao Spirit. What do you think? "
The Lord smiled, "You want me to join forces with you!"
The Dao Ancestor looked at the Lord, "Yes!"
The Lord chuckled, "Junior Brother, do you know that greed can kill people?"
The Dao Ancestor was expressionless, "If we can't reach the next level, how long do you and I have to live?
Ten thousand years?
A thousand years? "
The Lord was silent.
The Dao Ancestor continued, "One more thing. Senior Brother, don't you want to know why Mu Niannian is so strong?
He doesn't have the complete Dao Scripture but his wealth is above the Dao Realm. I believe that you must be curious too, right? "
The Lord smiled, "I am indeed curious!"
The Dao Ancestor said, "It's easy to figure it out. Just capture this person, right?"
The Lord did not speak. He slowly walked to the side of the cliff. No one knew what he was thinking.
The Dao Ancestor continued, "Senior Brother, you are worried about the person behind him!"
The Lord smiled, "Shouldn't I be worried?"
The Dao Ancestor said, "Everything has its risks!"
The Lord said softly, "This is a little risky!"
The Dao Ancestor was about to speak when the Lord said, "As far as I know, Ye Xuan has an agreement with the Dao Tomb. After he obtains the Dao Scripture, he will share it with the Dao Tomb!"
The Dao Ancestor's face darkened, "Senior Brother, do you really believe it?"
The Lord looked at the Dao Ancestor, "Why wouldn't I believe it?
After Ye Xuan obtained the Dao Scripture, he was very generous. He shared the five Dao Scriptures with the people around him! "
The Dao Ancestor said, "It's just to buy people's hearts!"
The Lord laughed, "Buy people's hearts?
Junior Brother!
You are still the same as before. You like to look at people with prejudice!
Sometimes, is it so difficult to admit the excellence of others? "
The Dao Ancestor was expressionless.
The Lord said, "Junior Brother, I am different from you. You have no way out because if you don't kill Ye Xuan, Ye Xuan will destroy your Daoting!
As for me, I have no reason to be enemies with him!
Why should I be enemies with him?
My Dao Tomb has already formed a good relationship with him. Why should I turn this good relationship into a bad one?
Of course, I am also tempted by what you said. Gather all the Dao Scriptures, awaken the spirit of the Dao, and reach a higher level!
However, even if I am tempted, there is no need for me to be enemies with Ye Xuan.
Why?
Because after Ye Xuan gathers all the Dao Scriptures, I don't think there will be any problem with him sharing it! "
As he said this, he looked at the Dao Ancestor and smiled, "It might be difficult for you to share it. However, I don't think there will be any difficulty for Ye Xuan to share it!
This person has a pure heart and values relationships. Most importantly, he doesn't care about the Dao Scriptures.
When he gathers all eight scrolls, I will give him the one from my Dao Tomb. I believe that it won't be difficult for him to share the complete version of the Dao Scripture. What do you think? "
The Dao Ancestor smiled, "It seems that Senior Brother thinks that I, Daoting, will definitely lose this battle!"
The Lord shook his head, "That is not what I am concerned about. What I am concerned about is what choice I should make to maximize my benefits!"
As he said this, he looked at the sky and smiled, "I will not help Ye Xuan fight you. Although he is worth befriending, I do not want to be involved in this whirlpool. After all, he is a person with the Cause of Disaster. It is better to stay away from him!
Also, I will not help you fight him. You are an ingrate. It is better to help him than to help you. After all, Ye Xuan is a person who values relationships more than you. "
As he said this, he looked at the Dao Ancestor and smiled, "I will wait and see!"
The Dao Ancestor smiled, "What if I win?"
The Lord blinked, "If you win, will you be able to gather all the Dao Scriptures?
Junior Brother, don't forget that I also have the Dao Scriptures. You win!
If you want to gather all the Dao Scriptures, you have to beg me! "
The Dao Ancestor looked at the Lord and did not speak.
The Lord smiled, "For the sake of my dead Master, I will give you a piece of advice. It is not scary to make mistakes, but it is scary to make mistakes again and again!
Mu Niannian has been resurrected. Ye Xuan's hatred for the Daoting is not that great!
Admit defeat and form a good relationship with the Fifth Dimension. I believe that it should not be a big problem. After all, Mu Niannian is alive. For Ye Xuan, as long as Mu Niannian is not dead, anything can be discussed.
As for the Dao Scriptures … If it is yours, then it is yours. If it is not, then don't force it! "
The Dao Ancestor looked at the Lord and smiled, "Senior Brother, do you know why you lost to me?"
Without waiting for the Lord to answer, the Dao Ancestor said, "Because I fight. I fight for everything. Since I have set foot on this path, I must fight!
Watch carefully. This time, I will fight with Ye Xuan! "
As he said this, he turned around and disappeared into the horizon.
On the mountain peak, the Lord was silent for a moment. Then, he shook his head and smiled, "Fight your sister!"
.....







Chapter 1404
The Five-Dimensional Universe!
Ye Xuan returned to the Five-Dimensional Universe. At this moment, his heart was extremely heavy!
Lord True Martial had reached the Dao Attainment Realm!
This was one disaster after another for the Five-Dimensional Universe!
He was also extremely depressed. How did that guy reach the Dao Attainment Realm?
Could it be that his battle with White Robe inspired that guy?
Thinking of this, Ye Xuan could not help but shake his head and sigh.
This trip to the Daoting Realm was a huge loss!
Inside the hall.
Ye Xuan had just entered the Sword Hall when he saw Guan Yin!
Beside Guan Yin was a man in black. It was Li Zuo.
Ye Xuan was stunned when he saw Li Zuo, then hurriedly said, "Senior Li Zuo, you're back so soon?"
Li Zuo said solemnly, "I called two people, both at the peak of the Dao Attainment Realm. However, they will need thirty thousand Fortune Divine Crystals for each attack. Is there a problem?"
Ye Xuan smiled. "No problem!"
What he lacked the least now were Fortune Divine Crystals!
Li Zuo nodded slightly. "That's good!
They are all in the dark. If you need them, they can attack at any time!
Of course, if the Five-Dimensional Universe has no chance of winning, they will not fight to the death. They will choose to leave! "
Ye Xuan nodded. "Understood!"
After all, they were here to make money, not to fight to the death!
Of course, he only needed them to help him hold back a few of the Daoting Realm's core powerhouses!
Li Zuo nodded and did not say anything else. He quietly left!
Ye Xuan looked at Guan Yin. Guan Yin smiled. "Aro, Jiu, An Lanxiu, and Wenxiu have all come out!"
Ye Xuan was about to speak when a woman walked in!
It was Zhang Wenxiu!
Seeing Zhang Wenxiu, Guan Yin smiled and retreated.
She knew that Ye Xuan and Zhang Wenxiu had a special relationship!
Ye Xuan looked at Zhang Wenxiu and smiled. "Congratulations!"
Zhang Wenxiu had reached the Dao Validation realm!
Zhang Wenxiu walked over to Ye Xuan and sized up Ye Xuan. "Let's spar?"
Ye Xuan laughed and said, "You really want to beat me?"
Zhang Wenxiu rolled her eyes at Ye Xuan. She walked to the side and sat down. "Looks like I won't be able to defeat you!"
Ye Xuan sat beside Zhang Wenxiu. "Wenxiu, how's the Academy?"
Zhang Wenxiu smiled and said, "It's getting better and better. The current academy is several times bigger than before!
The Headmaster of the Academy only teaches every day. She is very relaxed! "
Ye Xuan turned to look at Zhang Wenxiu. "What about you?
What are your plans for the future? "
Zhang Wenxiu looked at Ye Xuan and did not say anything.
Ye Xuan blinked. "Did I say something wrong?"
Zhang Wenxiu did not say anything. She stood up and left!
Ye Xuan quickly grabbed Zhang Wenxiu's hand. Zhang Wenxiu tried to break free, but Ye Xuan's physical strength was too strong. She could not break free at all.
Ye Xuan asked softly, "What's wrong?"
Zhang Wenxiu was expressionless and did not say anything.
Ye Xuan caressed Zhang Wenxiu's hand and said softly, "I know that I have neglected you these days. I, Ye Xuan, am not a heartless person. But you also know that too many things have happened in the Fifth Dimension!"
Zhang Wenxiu did not say anything.
She knew that ever since Mu Niannian left, Ye Xuan had shouldered too much!
Now, the safety of the entire Fifth Dimension was on Ye Xuan's shoulders.
Ye Xuan said again, "If I am not wrong, Daoting might be risking his life!"
Zhang Wenxiu looked at Ye Xuan. "What are your plans?"
Ye Xuan smiled. "What plans can I have?
Of course, I will fight them to the death! "
Zhang Wenxiu was silent.
Ye Xuan held Zhang Wenxiu's hand and said softly, "I can't promise you anything because I might die tomorrow!"
Zhang Wenxiu shook her head. "I don't need you to promise me anything."
Ye Xuan smiled. "If we live, we live together. If we die, we die together!
What I owe you in this life, I will repay you in my next life! "
Zhang Wenxiu said calmly, "If you lose, will Daoting let you have a next life?"
Ye Xuan laughed. "That's true!
They will definitely annihilate my soul! "
Zhang Wenxiu looked at Ye Xuan with a complicated look in her eyes. "You have matured a lot!"
She still remembered the Ye Xuan of the past. At that time, Ye Xuan was sloppy and not serious at all!
But now, Ye Xuan was the Master of the Fifth Dimension!
As if she thought of something, Zhang Wenxiu suddenly grabbed Ye Xuan's hand. "Do you know?
I have been a little worried these days. I am not worried about Daoting, but worried about you. I am worried that you are walking too fast! "
Ye Xuan blinked. "I am walking too fast?"
Zhang Wenxiu nodded. "You are walking too fast!
So fast that I can't keep up with you! "
Ye Xuan fell silent.
Zhang Wenxiu looked at Ye Xuan. "It is not just me. They all have this worry."
Ye Xuan smiled. "I have to walk fast!"
Zhang Wenxiu nodded. "I understand!"
Ye Xuan took out a storage ring and placed it in Zhang Wenxiu's hand. "There are one million Fortune Divine Crystals and some treasures that you can use!"
Zhang Wenxiu did not refuse. She put away the storage ring and said, "If there is anything, we will all bear it together. Don't bear it alone, understand?"
Ye Xuan nodded. "Okay!"
Zhang Wenxiu looked at Ye Xuan. "Even if we die, we will die together.
Of course, it is best if we can live!
After all, you still owe me so much! "
Ye Xuan held Zhang Wenxiu's hand tightly and smiled. "I will repay what I owe you in this lifetime!"
Zhang Wenxiu suddenly threw herself into Ye Xuan's arms. She closed her eyes and shook her head. "Men smell so bad!"
Then, she turned and left.
Inside the hall, Ye Xuan was silent.
At this time, a middle-aged man suddenly appeared in the hall.
The person who had come was the High Lord!
Ye Xuan looked at the Lord. "Senior, are you the Lord of the Dao Tomb?"
The Lord smiled. "How did you guess?"
Ye Xuan said, "There is only one Dao Ancestor that can make me feel threatened. The other one is the Lord!"
The Lord laughed. "Ye Xuan, there is more than one Dao Ancestor in the Daoting realm!"
Ye Xuan smiled. "I was just guessing, but it seems like I was right!"
Looking at Ye Xuan, the Lord said, "I am here to talk about cooperation with you!"
Ye Xuan said, "Senior, please speak!"
The Lord laughed and said, "You are a straightforward person, so I won't beat around the bush!
What I mean is simple. This time, the Dao Tomb will not interfere in the matter between you and the Daoting. "
Ye Xuan said, "Senior, please continue!"
The Lord continued. "If you can gather all eight Dao Scriptures, I will give you the one in the Dao Tomb. You can summon the Dao Spirit!
But in return, I want to see the complete Dao Scripture!
Is there a problem? "
Ye Xuan smiled. "Senior, I have discussed this with Senior Rahu. We have reached an agreement!"
The Lord looked at Ye Xuan. "I just want to confirm!"
Ye Xuan said, "Senior, don't worry. If I can gather all nine Dao Scriptures, I will let you have a look!"
The Lord smiled. "Thank you!"
He turned to leave.
At this moment, Ye Xuan suddenly said, "Sir, can we talk about something else?"
The Lord turned to Ye Xuan. "You are trying to trick me!"
Ye Xuan was speechless.
The Lord smiled. "Although I know you are trying to trick me, I am willing to listen to you. Consider it as giving you face!
After all, I still have to give you face! "
Ye Xuan looked at the Lord. "Senior, I want to borrow a few people from you!"
The Lord blinked. "I said!
The Dao Tomb will not interfere! "
Ye Xuan smiled. "Senior, Sister Nian has reached the Dao Realm!"
The Lord's smile froze.
Ye Xuan said, "Sister Nian and I are very close!"
He looked at the Lord. "Senior, do you want to make a bet?"
The Lord was silent.
He knew what Ye Xuan meant!
If Ye Xuan won and Mu Niannian regained his memory, he could ask Mu Niannian for guidance!
If he could ask Mu Niannian for guidance, the complete Dao Scripture would be nothing!
Why would Mu Niannian teach him?
It was simple!
Ye Xuan!
If Ye Xuan spoke up for him, it would be simple!
Who didn't know the relationship between Ye Xuan and Mu Niannian?
A moment later, the Lord suddenly said, "I will give you six Dao Defense Peak Stage powerhouses. I have secretly trained these six people. Even Luo Hou doesn't know of their existence.
Their strength is second only to Luo Hou and the Heavenly King! "
Then, six black-robed people appeared behind him.
All six of them were Dao Defense Peak Stage powerhouses.
The Lord looked at Ye Xuan. "Now, the six of them will listen to your orders."
Ye Xuan said, "Thank you!"
The Lord suddenly laughed, "Can you tell me the truth?"
Ye Xuan said with a smile, "What do you mean?"
The Lord smiled. "For example, your true background!
And the people behind you! "
Ye Xuan shook his head. "Senior, you won't believe me even if I tell you!"
The Lord smiled. "How can I believe you if you don't tell me?"
Ye Xuan thought for a moment. "Actually, I am the Son of the Plane of the Nine-Dimensional Universe!"
The Lord blinked. "Scram!"
Then, he turned and disappeared.
Inside the palace, Ye Xuan shook his head.
His own background?
In fact, he didn't even know!
Ye Xuan gazed at the six of them, and then he pointed with his finger. Six spatial rings descended before them, and every single one of them contained 100,000 Divine Fortune Crystals!
The six of them glanced at the spatial rings. Meanwhile, one of the black-robed figures hesitated for a moment before he said, "Young Master Ye, you're too kind!"
Ye Xuan smiled. "The battle with the Daoting is of utmost importance to the Five-Dimensional Universe. I hope that all of you can help me when the time comes. If I, Ye Xuan, am able to survive, then I, Ye Xuan, will definitely reward all of you handsomely!"
The black-robed figure in the lead put the spatial rings away. "We'll do our best."
Ye Xuan nodded. "Thank you!
All of you hide yourselves for now. I'll ask all of you to lend a hand when the time comes! "
The six of them nodded, and then they vanished without a trace.
Ye Xuan walked out of the palace, and he looked up into the depths of the starry sky. No one knew what he was thinking.
Meanwhile, Nian Nian suddenly appeared by Ye Xuan's side. She took Ye Xuan's hand and said softly, "I still can't remember anything!"
She'd been trying hard to recall the past, but she couldn't!
Ye Xuan withdrew his gaze, looked at Nian Nian, and smiled. "If you can't remember, then don't think about it!
This time, I'll protect you. "
Nian Nian looked at Ye Xuan and didn't say anything.
Ye Xuan continued. "Just like how you protected me last time …"
Nian Nian looked up at Ye Xuan. "What if you can't win?"
Ye Xuan smiled. "Then I'll die with Nian Nian!
This time, if we live, then we'll live together. If we die, then we'll die together! "
...
Ancient God Abyss.
An old man stood silently at the top of a pyramid. He looked up into the depths of the starry sky, and his eyes were filled with confusion!
This person was Su Zhe!
Ever since he'd met the woman in the plain dress, he'd been deeply affected!
He'd already achieved the Dao. Originally, he'd thought that he was already standing at the peak of martial arts in this world. However, the appearance of the woman in the plain dress made him understand that he hadn't reached the peak at all. In fact, he was still a long way from the true peak!
That woman was so strong that it made people feel hopeless!
How could there be such a powerful person in this world?
At this moment, an old man suddenly appeared beside Su Zhe.
This person was Su Ke, who'd come into contact with Ye Xuan in the depths of the Dark World!
Su Zhe withdrew his gaze. "How's the investigation going?"
Su Ke said in a low voice. "It's clear. The young man I met in the Dark World is the brother of the woman in the plain dress!"
In fact, he didn't know the woman in the plain dress. When she came to the Ancient God Abyss, he wasn't there.
When he returned to the Ancient God Abyss and heard about the woman in the plain dress, he felt a lingering fear. Because he'd met Ye Xuan!
At that time, he'd almost attacked Ye Xuan … Every time he thought about it, he felt a lingering fear.
That mysterious woman had almost destroyed the Ancient God Abyss!
After the lingering fear, he rejoiced. This was because he'd formed a good relationship with Ye Xuan.
At this time, Su Zhe asked, "That young man is in the Fifth Dimension?"
Su Ke nodded. "Yes!
However, his current situation doesn't seem to be good! "
Su Zhe looked at Su Ke. "What do you mean?"
Su Ke said in a low voice. "According to what I know, that Daoting wants to attack him!"
Su Zhe was stunned. "Daoting wants to attack him?"
Su Ke nodded. "Young Master Ye has five Dao Scriptures. Moreover, he seems to have a blood feud with Daoting!
Now that Daoting Dao Ancestor has come out, he's about to attack the Fifth Dimension. "
Su Zhe said softly, "This Daoting … His strength isn't that great, but his guts are really big!"
As he said this, he looked at Su Zhe. "Don't they know how strong that senior is?"
Su Ke said in a low voice. "According to my investigation, they've investigated that senior. The two people that senior killed were from Daoting."
Su Zhe frowned. "Then why do they still dare to cause trouble for Young Master Ye?"
Su Ke smiled bitterly. "That senior only used one sword to kill them. Therefore, they don't know her true strength … They might have misunderstood her strength!"
Su Zhe was silent.
That senior only used one sword to kill, but Daoting didn't know that she only used one sword to kill Dao Realm cultivators!
Forget about Dao Realm cultivators, even if he was in front of her, he wouldn't be able to withstand one sword!
Su Ke suddenly asked, "Should we help?"
Su Zhe smiled. "Of course we should help!
That senior values this Young Master Ye so much. If we can form a good relationship with this Young Master Ye, it'll be the same as forming a good relationship with that senior! "
As he said this, he paused and then said, "That senior might be training this Young Master Ye. Therefore, we shouldn't rush to intervene. If Young Master Ye is in danger, it won't be too late for us to intervene."
Su Ke nodded. "Alright!
I'll go to the Fifth Dimension now! "
Su Zhe suddenly said, "Bring some people with you!"
Su Ke looked at Su Zhe. "How many people?"
Su Zhe thought for a moment and said, "Just in case, bring ten Dao Realm cultivators with you!
If there are any changes, inform me immediately. "

Chapter 1405
In the Fifth Dimension.
On this day, somewhere in the Fifth Dimension, the starry sky suddenly split open. Then, a middle-aged man walked out!
Dao Ancestor!
The moment the Dao Ancestor appeared in the starry sky of the Fifth Dimension, all living beings in the Fifth Dimension felt a formless power!
A Dao Realm expert!
Behind the Dao Ancestor were Bai Dizi and the others.
Almost all the Daoting experts were here!
The Dao Ancestor suddenly said, "Set up the array!"
As soon as he said that, seven Godly Lords suddenly appeared in seven different directions. The next moment, the constellations moved and a huge starlight array covered the entire starry sky!
Seven Stars Divine Array!
In the depths of the starry sky, the power of countless stars continuously gathered towards this array.
This was the most powerful array of the Daoting experts. It could borrow the power of thousands of stars!
At this moment, Ye Xuan suddenly appeared in front of the Dao Ancestor.
The Dao Ancestor looked at Ye Xuan. "Aren't you the young master of the Whirling Sect?
Now, you can call the experts of the Whirling Sect to save you!
Or, you can call the woman in the plain dress behind you! "
Ye Xuan nodded. "Okay!"
After saying that, he took out the Qiankun Gourd. "Immortal Gourd, call some people over!"
There was no response!
Ye Xuan said in a deep voice, "Immortal Gourd, don't play dead. Call some people over to help!"
At this moment, Immortal Gourd suddenly said, "Kid, I can call people over. I really can. However, if the people I call over know that you have so many Dao scriptures, hehe …"
Ye Xuan threw Immortal Gourd into the World Prison Pagoda.
As if thinking of something, Ye Xuan spread out his hands and the blood in his body started to tremble!
Bloodline power!
Seeing this scene, the Dao Ancestor's expression changed subtly!
Ye Xuan's bloodline had always been a mystery!
Who was this guy's son?
At this moment, Ye Xuan suddenly raised his head and roared, "Ancestor Summoning!"
Ancestor Summoning!
Everyone: "…"
The Daoting and the other experts' expressions were extremely strange!
This guy wanted to summon his ancestor?
The Dao Ancestor's expression gradually turned solemn. He did not dare to underestimate Ye Xuan's bloodline.
As soon as Ye Xuan's voice fell, a blood-red light suddenly shot up from his body. In an instant, the entire starry sky turned blood-red. It was extremely terrifying!
The expressions of the experts from the Dao Palace turned solemn when they witnessed this scene.
It looked a little scary!
When Ye Xuan shouted 'Ancestral Summoning', in a distant part of the starry sky, a man in green suddenly stopped. He turned his head and frowned. "What is he doing?"
Beside the azure-robed man, a spear-wielding woman asked, "What's wrong?"
The blue-clothed man had a strange expression. "He's summoning his ancestor!"
The woman: "…"
The azure-clothed man shook his head. "You even summoned your ancestor!
He wants to ascend to the heavens! "
The woman said, "Maybe he ran into some trouble!"
The green-robed man pulled the woman's hand and walked away. "Ignore him!"
The woman was about to speak when the azure-clothed man suddenly stopped. He turned his head and frowned. There was killing intent in his eyes.
The woman asked, "What's wrong?"
The azure-clothed man said, "Nianxue is in trouble!"
The woman was about to speak when the azure-clothed man said, "Wait for me. I'll be back soon!"
With that, he disappeared on the spot.
The woman: "…"
At the side, the horned little girl suddenly said, "The daughter is her biological daughter. The son must have been picked up!"
...
In the Five-Dimensional Universe, Ye Xuan looked at the starry sky without any reaction.
Ye Xuan frowned. He tried again, but there was still no response.
Ye Xuan's expression darkened!
Damn it!
Summoning his ancestor didn't work!
This was a little awkward!
At this moment, the Dao Ancestor suddenly said, "Ye Xuan, I'll give you a chance to live. Are you leaving?"
Ye Xuan looked at the Dao Ancestor. "Dao Ancestor, why are you still saying such nonsense to me at a time like this? Are you retarded?"
The Dao Ancestor was about to speak when Ye Xuan suddenly said, "Jia Lou!"
As soon as he finished speaking, a black shadow flashed out of Ye Xuan's body. In the next moment, a huge dragon that was tens of thousands of meters long appeared in the starry sky!
Jia Lou!
At this moment, Jia Lou had already cultivated a Dao Body!
When he saw Jia Lou, the Dao Ancestor's expression changed.
He looked at Ye Xuan. "Jia Lou, you …"
Ye Xuan looked at Jia Lou. "Hold him back!"
In the sky, Jia Lou dove directly towards the Dao Ancestor.
This charge caused the starry sky to tremble as if it was about to shatter. It was extremely shocking.
When they saw this scene, the expressions of the Daoting experts changed.
This pressure was not weaker than the Dao Ancestor's at all!
A trace of hostility flashed in the Dao Ancestor's eyes. He lightly stomped his right foot and shot into the sky. In the sky, he punched out.
This punch caused the entire starry sky to become illusory!
Boom!
The entire starry sky suddenly trembled violently. Then, Jia Lou was blasted back. However, her strong body had withstood all the power of the Dao Ancestor's punch!
After forcing Jia Lou back with a punch, the Dao Ancestor turned to look at Bai Dizi. "Kill!
Leave no one alive! "
With that, he turned and rushed towards Jia Lou again.
Below, Bai Dizi suddenly said, "Get out of the formation!"
As soon as he finished speaking, the Seven Star God Formation suddenly trembled violently. In the next moment, the energy of countless stars converged to form a huge blade, and the space around the huge blade instantly became illusory as soon as it appeared!
This huge blade contained endless power of the stars!
In the sky, Bai Dizi suddenly roared, "Kill!"
The seven Divine Lords pointed at Ye Xuan below as soon as they finished speaking.
Chi!
The huge blade of stars tore through the sky from the center of the formation. Wherever the blade passed, space was directly torn and shattered!
Ye Xuan had to receive this attack. If he did not, the huge blade of stars would enter the Fifth Dimension and destroy the Fifth Dimension's Origin!
However, Ye Xuan did not dodge and allowed the huge blade of stars to slash into his body.
Boom!
Under everyone's gaze, the huge blade of stars was directly absorbed by Ye Xuan!
Ye Xuan's aura skyrocketed!
Seeing this scene, all the experts on the Daoting stage were stunned.
Bai Dizi looked at Ye Xuan in disbelief and said with a trembling voice, "You … you can even absorb the power of the stars …"
With that, he roared like a madman, "Ye Xuan!
Ah ah ah ah!
Is there anything that you can't absorb? "
...
At that moment, Bai Dizi was indeed very aggrieved!
Ye Xuan could absorb Sword Qi, Turbid Qi, and Death Qi. But now, Ye Xuan could even absorb the power of the stars!
Was this guy a black hole?
He could absorb anything!
Below, Ye Xuan greedily took a deep breath, an intoxicated expression on his face.
After absorbing the power of the stars, he felt that his cultivation level had improved a lot!
It was really a great supplement!
Ye Xuan looked at Bai Dizi, cupped his fists, and said with a smile, "Thank you!"
Hearing this, Bai Dizi's face twitched. This was killing people!
Ye Xuan looked up at Jia Lou and the Dao Ancestor. Jia Lou had already been suppressed by the Dao Ancestor. Obviously, Jia Lou's strength was inferior to the Dao Ancestor's. However, with Jia Lou's powerful physical body, the Dao Ancestor could not do anything to her for a while!
Ye Xuan withdrew his gaze and looked at White Robe. "Little Seven!"
As his voice fell, a sword light suddenly broke through the air from afar!
Not far away, White Robe frowned slightly. He suddenly turned his head and stabbed out with his spear.
Bang!
White Robe was blasted over 100m back!
White Robe stared fixedly at Little Seven who had appeared in front of him. "You've become stronger again!"
He'd fought Little Seven the last time, and Little Seven wasn't so strong at that time!
Little Seven didn't waste his breath at all. He charged at White Robe with his sword in hand.
White Robe stomped his right foot on the ground, and then he vanished on the spot. In an instant, numerous sounds of slicing resounded.
After White Robe was stopped, Ye Xuan looked at Bai Dizi and the others. Bai Dizi was about to speak when Ye Xuan suddenly waved his right hand. In an instant, over 100,000 energy swords appeared around him.
The expressions of Bai Dizi and the others changed drastically when they witnessed this scene.
Ye Xuan suddenly pressed his fingers together and pointed forward. "Slash!"
As soon as he finished speaking, over 100,000 energy swords tore through the air, and it was an extremely magnificent sight!
Right at this moment, a white haired old man suddenly appeared in front of Bai Dizi and the others. The white haired old man opened his palm, and a white square mirror appeared in his hand. In the next moment, a strand of dazzling white light suddenly erupted from the mirror!
Bang!
Ye Xuan's foul energy was completely obstructed by the white light, and it was gradually dispersed!
Ye Xuan frowned when he witnessed this scene. What sort of mirror is that?
It's actually able to disperse my foul energy!
However, the white mirror in the white haired old man's hand was slowly becoming illusory as well!
Ye Xuan didn't retract his foul energy because he noticed that the white haired old man's mirror was on the verge of vanishing!
Right at this moment, the white haired old man suddenly put the mirror away, and then he transformed into an afterimage that shot explosively towards Ye Xuan!
Hiss!
His body tore through space, and the space in an area of over 3km was even split apart into spiderwebs by the white haired old man's body. It was an extremely shocking sight!
Moreover, the foul energy hadn't even approached the white haired old man when it was blasted away by a powerful force!
Ye Xuan's expression instantly became solemn when he witnessed this scene!
A Dao Attainment Realm expert!
The white haired old man was actually an expert at the Dao Attainment Realm!
Meanwhile, the white haired old man had arrived in front of Ye Xuan, and then he smashed his fist forward.
This punch was very simple, yet it contained an extremely overbearing and violent force. This violent force seemed as if it could destroy the entire Fifth Dimension, and it was extremely terrifying!
At the instant that the white haired old man struck out with his fist, some of the foul energy in the space around Ye Xuan was instantly transformed into nothingness. It wasn't just the foul energy, even the space around Ye Xuan was shattered and obliterated at this moment!
The might of this punch was sufficient to shatter the heavens and the earth!
Ye Xuan didn't dodge. He was unable to dodge this punch, so he could only take it head-on.
Ye Xuan took a step forward, drew his sword, and slashed.
Dao Sword!
His sword slashed out, and sword light shot out like a waterfall.
Rumble!
An expanse of sword light shattered, and Ye Xuan instantly retreated explosively by over 1km. As soon as he stopped, the space behind him had been transformed into nothingness!
Ye Xuan gazed at the white haired old man with a solemn expression.
This old man was much stronger than the white-robed old man and Zhen Wu!
The white haired old man glanced at Ye Xuan, then turned his head to look at Bai Dizi. Bai Dizi understood and looked down at the Fifth Dimension. "Kill!"
As soon as his voice fell, the Daoting experts behind him rushed toward the Fifth Dimension.
This time, they didn't just want to kill Ye Xuan, but also the entire Fifth Dimension.
As long as the Fifth Dimension was not destroyed, Mu Niannian wouldn't die. Therefore, they had to destroy the entire Fifth Dimension to avoid any future troubles.
At this moment, sword cries suddenly resounded from below, and the next moment, hundreds of sword lights collided from below!
Sword Sect!
More than 300 Swordsman directly rushed into the starry sky.
Although the Daoting experts had a higher realm than the Swordsman from the Sword Sect, these Swordsman didn't have the slightest bit of fear in their eyes.
Fight!
In the eyes of all the Swordsman, there was only fighting spirit!
Senior Sister Lu, who was in the lead, pointed her sword at the Daoting experts. "Fight to the last man!
Kill! "
As soon as her voice fell, she directly turned into a sword light and rushed out.
Hundreds of Swordsman attacked at the same time. In an instant, sword qi swept across the entire starry sky with terrifying momentum!
Bai Dizi was expressionless. "Courting death!"
These Swordsman's battle prowess wasn't bad, but the difference between their realms and the Daoting experts was too big!
One had to know that the weakest Daoting experts were Dao Validation experts. Moreover, the majority of Daoting experts were Dao Defense experts.
What was important was that these people had all stayed in the Celestial Abyss before, so their combat experience was quite rich.
If these Swordsman were all Dao Validation experts, perhaps there would be a fight. Unfortunately, these Swordsman were mostly Self Release experts!
At this moment, six mysterious experts suddenly rushed toward Bai Dizi and the others. They were the six people that the Lord had given to Ye Xuan. Apart from them, there were also Li Zuo and the other two. All three of them were at the peak of Dao Defense!
Nine super Dao Defense Realm experts!
Seeing these nine people, Bai Dizi's expression changed subtly. However, these nine people wouldn't be able to change the outcome of the battle!
At this moment, Ye Xuan, who was not far away, suddenly opened his palm. The next moment, twelve black shadows flew out from his palm. Then, twelve enormous Naga Dragon souls appeared in the starry sky!
As soon as the twelve Naga Dragon souls appeared, Bai Dizi's expression changed!
It wasn't just Bai Dizi, the white-haired old man who stood before Ye Xuan frowned as well!
These twelve Naga Dragon souls were over 10km tall, and they emanated extremely powerful dragon energy. Even though they were only dragon souls, their auras were extremely powerful, and they were merely inferior to the two Dao Attainment Realm experts and Jia Lou!
The white-haired old man stared fixedly at Ye Xuan, "What's your relationship with the Naga Dragons!?"
Ye Xuan looked at the white-haired old man and smiled, "Take a guess!"
The white-haired old man didn't speak.
Ye Xuan is becoming more and more mysterious!
Suddenly, the twelve Naga Dragon souls swooped down towards Daoting and the other experts!
The twelve Naga Dragon souls swooped down in unison as if they intended to crush this expanse of the starry sky. At this moment, the entire starry sky trembled as if it was on the verge of collapse. It was an extremely shocking sight.
Ye Xuan was slightly shocked as well because he hadn't expected the Naga Dragon souls to be so strong!
The twelve Naga Dragon souls were sufficient to resist a few dozen Dao Attainment Realm experts!
At the same time, An Lanxiu and the others had arrived.
An Lanxiu, Aro, A 'Jiu, Situ, Zhang Wenxiu, Lian Wanli, and the others had attained the Dao Validation Realm. Even though they were only at the Dao Validation Realm, they didn't feel any pressure when resisting Dao Attainment Realm experts!
Bai Dizi's face instantly fell when he witnessed this scene!
The overall strength of the Fifth Dimension was still inferior to Daoting, but it wasn't as weak as Daoting thought either!
The current Fifth Dimension was completely capable of fighting Daoting!
As if he'd thought of something, Bai Dizi suddenly turned to look at the white-haired old man in the distance, "Elder Mi, kill Ye Xuan first!"
The white-haired old man looked at Ye Xuan, and then he slowly clenched his right hand. At this moment, the space around him instantly became illusory.
In the distance, Ye Xuan slowly closed his eyes, and a powerful strand of killing intent gradually spread out from within him.
Meanwhile, the white-haired old man suddenly vanished on the spot. Meanwhile, Ye Xuan suddenly opened his eyes, and they were completely blood red!
Ye Xuan suddenly roared furiously, "Kill!"
As soon as he finished speaking, he slashed down with his sword.
This strike wasn't just a Dao Sword, it also contained killing intent!
An expanse of blood red light suddenly erupted in front of him. In an instant, Ye Xuan retreated explosively by over 1km, and he'd just stopped when the white-haired old man suddenly appeared in front of him. After that, the white-haired old man smashed his fist towards Ye Xuan's stomach!
This punch could destroy the heavens and the earth!
However, at this moment, Ye Xuan actually didn't dodge at all and allowed the punch to strike his chest.
Bang!
Ye Xuan's figure was blasted flying, but at the instant he flew, a sword stabbed into the white-haired old man's left shoulder.
Soul Suppressing Sword!
Bang!
A powerful soul force directly enveloped the white-haired old man, causing his expression to change drastically. His reaction was extremely fast, and his right hand abruptly pulled out the Soul Suppressing Sword. At the same time, his entire figure retreated hundreds of meters.
After stopping, the white-haired old man's body turned illusory, and his entire person was extremely abnormal. However, his soul gradually returned to normal.
After all, he was a Dao Attainment Realm expert, so it was impossible for his soul to be shattered by a single slash from the Soul Suppressing Sword!
After the white-haired old man's soul calmed down, he lifted his head to look at Ye Xuan in the distance. There was a trace of seriousness in his eyes. In that instant just now, he'd almost fallen for Ye Xuan's Dao!
If he hadn't reacted fast enough, his soul would've been severely injured!
Other than that, he'd also noticed something else, and that was Ye Xuan's physical body!
Ye Xuan had forcefully taken a punch from him, but Ye Xuan was still standing normally!
The white-haired old man unwaveringly stared at Ye Xuan. "Your physical body is unexpectedly strong to this extent!"
In the distance, Ye Xuan slowly closed his eyes. In his heart, he felt that it was a pity. That sword just now had almost seriously injured the old man's soul!
He'd still underestimated a Dao Realm expert!
Ye Xuan opened his eyes and looked around. At this moment, the experts of the Fifth Dimension and the Daoting experts were already in full swing. Because of the twelve Naga Dragon souls, the Fifth Dimension's side was not too disadvantaged!
However, the situation was not good for the Fifth Dimension, because Jia Lou couldn't beat the Dao Ancestor!
At this moment, Jia Lou was completely suppressed. If it weren't for her physical body being too strong, she would have already been killed.
At this moment, the Dao Ancestor suddenly punched Jia Lou. He didn't follow up with another attack. Instead, he looked down at Ye Xuan and said fiercely, "Ye Xuan, today, you and that Mu Niannian must die. No one can protect the two of you!"
As his voice faded, he opened his palm and roared, "Great Dao Restoration!"
As his voice faded, the starlight in the entire starry sky was annihilated!
On the other side, the white-haired old man slowly clenched his right hand, and a powerful fist force locked onto Ye Xuan. It should be said that the entire starry sky was enveloped by this fist force!
Fist Dao!
Obviously, the two of them wanted to join forces to kill Ye Xuan first!
As long as they killed Ye Xuan, the entire Fifth Dimension would instantly collapse!
How terrifying would it be if two Dao Realm experts joined forces?
At this moment, in the starry sky, the Dao Ancestor suddenly slapped down with his palm.
A palm print swept down from the starry sky!
Boom!
The entire starry sky trembled as if there was a huge earthquake!
In front of Ye Xuan, the white-haired old man suddenly took a step forward and punched out.
Boom!
A fist print that could destroy heaven and earth headed straight for Ye Xuan. Wherever the fist print passed, the starry sky was destroyed!
...







Chapter 1406
In the starry sky, Ye Xuan was like a floating page in the ocean in front of these two forces. He seemed so frail!
At this moment, Ye Xuan's expression was surprisingly calm.
Could he beat them?
He definitely couldn't!
Ye Xuan could at most fight one Dao Attainment Realm expert. He definitely couldn't fight two Dao Attainment Realm experts working together. After all, he was only at the Dao Validation Realm!
Even with a Dao Body, he couldn't beat two Dao Attainment Realm experts!
But he couldn't retreat!
Ye Xuan wasn't a pedantic person. In the past, he would have chosen to flee if he couldn't beat them.
But at this moment, he had no way out!
Because the Five-Dimensional Universe was behind him!
His family and friends were behind him!
Nian Nian was behind him!
If he retreated, everyone would die!
Since he couldn't retreat, he could only fight!
He had to fight even if he couldn't beat them!
At this point, the blood in Ye Xuan's body suddenly trembled. Gradually, powerful bloodline power surged out of his body.
Killing intent and bloodline power!
The Executing Heaven Sword in Ye Xuan's hand became a sword spirit. Ye Xuan suddenly took a step forward and slashed with his sword!
Dao Sword!
A Dao Sword that was enhanced by killing intent and bloodline power!
The power of this sword shook the starry sky!
Bang!
As soon as Ye Xuan slashed with his sword, a blood-colored sword light suddenly exploded in front of him. In an instant, Ye Xuan retreated thousands of meters.
Although he was strong, he couldn't resist the power of two Dao Attainment Realm experts!
In the sky, the Dao Ancestor was about to attack again when Jia Lou slammed into him!
A trace of viciousness flashed in the Dao Ancestor's eyes as he punched.
Bang!
Jialou was sent flying by the punch, and many parts of her body had already begun to slowly crack!
After sending Jia Lou flying, the Dao Ancestor looked down at Ye Xuan. At this moment, Ye Xuan slowly stood up. Although he hadn't fought with his life on the line, his powerful body had held on!
Although he was injured, it wasn't fatal!
The Dao Ancestor looked down at Ye Xuan, his eyes cold. "Overconfident ant!"
As soon as he finished speaking, he suddenly slapped his palm forward, and the space in front of Ye Xuan directly shattered layer by layer!
Ye Xuan suddenly leaped up and slashed forward with his sword in both hands.
Boom!
With a slash, the space in front of Ye Xuan was slashed into nothingness. At this time, the Dao Ancestor suddenly appeared in front of Ye Xuan. He pointed a finger at Ye Xuan. This finger directly touched the tip of Ye Xuan's sword.
Boom!
Ye Xuan flew out instantly, but the Dao Ancestor's entire arm also cracked at this moment!
The Dao Ancestor frowned slightly when he saw that. He looked at the sword in Ye Xuan's hand in the distance with a grim look in his eyes.
This sword was actually able to injure him!
As soon as Ye Xuan stopped, the white-haired old man suddenly appeared behind him, and the white-haired old man directly punched at Ye Xuan's head. If this punch hit, even if Ye Xuan had a Dao Body, he would probably be seriously injured.
Both the white-haired old man and the Dao Ancestor didn't hold back at all!
Their goal was to kill Ye Xuan!
Ye Xuan's reaction was extremely fast. At the instant the old man punched, he suddenly turned around and blocked with his sword.
Boom!
Ye Xuan's entire body directly retreated thousands of meters away!
And before he could stop, the Dao Ancestor appeared in front of him again!
Ye Xuan's pupils suddenly constricted, and he slashed with his sword.
Boom!
A wave of blood-red sword light suddenly exploded, and Ye Xuan was sent flying again!
As soon as he was sent flying, the Ancestral Lord suddenly approached him and threw a punch at Ye Xuan's face. Although it was just a simple punch...
Although it was just a simple punch, this punch was even more powerful than some Divine Skills!
At the level of experts like the Dao Ancestor, every punch and finger contained their own Dao, which was not something that some Divine Skills and Martial Skills could compare to.
Seeing this punch coming, Ye Xuan didn't dodge, and let the Dao Ancestor's punch hit his body. However, at this moment, his sword also slashed on the Dao Ancestor's head.
Boom!
The sword light shattered, and Ye Xuan flew out again. This time, he flew thousands of meters away!
And the Dao Ancestor forcibly withstood Ye Xuan's sword!
This was because a golden light had appeared around him, and it was this golden light that had withstood Ye Xuan's sword just now!
The Dao Ancestor looked coldly at Ye Xuan in the distance. "Do you think you're the only one who has a life-saving method?
You …. "
Right at this moment, Ye Xuan suddenly leaped up, and then he suddenly slashed his sword down towards the Dao Ancestor!
The moment he struck with his sword, the white-haired old man not far away suddenly disappeared. Immediately after, a fist mark appeared behind Ye Xuan. However, at this moment, a woman appeared behind Ye Xuan.
An Lanxiu!
An Lanxiu suddenly stabbed her spear forward.
Bang!
An Lanxiu was blasted 3km back, and as soon as she stopped moving, a wisp of blood seeped out from the corner of her mouth.
She hadn't cultivated a Dao Body, so she was utterly unable to endure the strength of an expert at the Dao Realm!
On the other hand, Ye Xuan's sword slashed towards the Dao Ancestor in the distance, but it was stopped by the Dao Ancestor as well!
Even though his Dao Sword was formidable, it was too difficult to kill a Dao Ancestor!
Meanwhile, An Lanxiu retreated to Ye Xuan's side, and she spoke in a low voice. "Are you alright?"
Even though Ye Xuan's bloodline had been activated, he hadn't gone completely berserk!
Even though his strength would increase explosively after going completely berserk, he wouldn't recognize anyone in that state!
So, he didn't dare allow himself to go completely berserk.
Ye Xuan wiped off the blood on the corner of his mouth. "I can still fight!"
An Lanxiu gazed at the white haired old man. "I'll stop him for you!"
As soon as she finished speaking, she was about to attack. However, Ye Xuan suddenly grabbed her hand.
An Lanxiu gazed at Ye Xuan, and Ye Xuan shook his head. "No!"
An Lanxiu didn't possess a Dao Body, so she was utterly unable to endure the white haired old man's strength.
Just that strike from before had already heavily injured An Lanxiu!
An Lanxiu was just about to speak when the Dao Ancestor suddenly vanished on the spot. After that, a formidable force swept towards Ye Xuan and An Lanxiu.
On the other side, the white haired old man had suddenly vanished on the spot as well.
Hiss!
The space behind Ye Xuan and An Lanxiu suddenly collapsed layer by layer.
An Lanxiu suddenly turned around. She didn't retreat but advanced instead, and she charged forward and stabbed her spear forward!
The spear was like a dragon that pierced through the heavens and the earth!
Meanwhile, a fist smashed directly onto An Lanxiu's spear ….
Bang!
The spear shook violently while An Lanxiu instantly retreated explosively. During the process of her retreat, her entire body suddenly became ethereal. In the next moment, she suddenly smashed her fist forward. As soon as her fist shot forward, countless afterimages suddenly appeared here, and all of these afterimages punched out at the same time!
The white haired old man who intended to follow up with another attack had suddenly stopped, and then he smashed his fist forward.
Bang!
The afterimages that covered the sky instantly vanished, and at this moment, a spear tore through the sky towards them.
The white haired old man frowned slightly as he punched once more, and the might of this punch was peerlessly domineering.
Bang!
The spear shattered into pieces, and An Lanxiu instantly retreated 3km away.
The white haired old man was just about to attack again when Jia Lou suddenly appeared in front of An Lanxiu. She glanced at An Lanxiu and said, "Let's attack together!"
As soon as she finished speaking, she charged directly towards the white-haired old man!
An Lanxiu stomped her right foot and transformed into a streak of white light that shot towards Bai.
The white-haired old man charged forward.
Meanwhile, Ye Xuan had already started fighting with that Dao Ancestor!
Ye Xuan was still suppressed, but without the help of the white-haired old man, the Dao Ancestor could only suppress Ye Xuan!
Because Ye Xuan's body was too strong!
Moreover, Ye Xuan had four domains. With the help of the four domains and the power of his bloodline, although he was suppressed, he could contend with the Dao Ancestor!
On the other side, the Lord had been paying attention to the battlefield in the starry sky.
Beside the Lord were Yan Yaoyao, Luo Hou and the others.
Luo Hou looked at Ye Xuan in the distance and said softly, "This person is truly a peerless genius!
To actually resist a Dao Ancestor for so long at the Dao Corroboration realm! "
Chi Yaoyao spoke abruptly, "His body is strong. If his body wasn't strong enough, he would have perished a long time ago!"
Luo Hou was quite curious, "What's his body?
Why is it so strong? "
As he spoke, he gazed at Yan Yaoyao.
Yan Yaoyao shook her head, "Don't look at me, I don't know either!"
She gazed at the Lord as she spoke, "The Lord is knowledgeable. Do you know what his body is?"
The Lord shook his head, "I've never seen such a strong body. It can even resist the strength of a Dao Attainment Realm expert!"
Meanwhile, Luo Hou spoke abruptly, "Those two women can't resist the Daoting Lord Mi."
Yan Yaoyao gazed at An Lanxiu and Jialou. Even though they were strong, they were still being suppressed by Lord Mi.
Ye Xuan wasn't suppressing them either!
If this continued, then Ye Xuan's side would lose sooner or later!
Meanwhile, Ah Ku spoke abruptly, "Have all of you noticed? Ye Xuan's aura is growing stronger and stronger!"
Everyone gazed at Ye Xuan. Even though Ye Xuan was being suppressed, his aura was growing stronger and stronger!
The Lord suddenly smiled, "Interesting. This fellow might be breaking through during the battle!"
Yan Yaoyao spoke softly, "Will the Dao Ancestor give him that chance?"
The Lord shook his head, "Once this fellow reaches the Dao Attainment Realm, it'll be impossible for the Dao Ancestor to kill him alone!
Even if he joins forces with Lord Mi, it'll be difficult to kill Ye Xuan! "
Chi Yaoyao spoke, "So they're going to use their trump card?"
The Lord nodded, "They should be!"
Ah Ku spoke abruptly, "Lord, if we help Ye Xuan now, wouldn't it be easy to destroy the Daoting Realm?"
The Lord smiled without a word.
Yan Yaoyao spoke softly, "If it's so easy to destroy the Daoting Realm, then you're underestimating the Daoting Realm!"
Ah Ku frowned, "Why? Do they have a stronger trump card?"
Yan Yaoyao looked at the Lord. The Lord smiled, "You'll be shocked!"
Ah Ku spoke in a low voice, "Then why aren't they using the Daoting Realm?"
Chi Yaoyao replied, "If I'm not wrong, they're saving it to deal with the people behind Ye Xuan Realm!"
Ah Ku glanced around and spoke softly, "Will the people behind Ye Xuan Realm appear?"
The Lord smiled, "Who knows?"
At this moment, Ye Xuan, who was not far away, suddenly forced the Tao Ancestor back with a sword strike.
Everyone looked at Ye Xuan in the distance. Ye Xuan stood there with his sword in hand, exuding a powerful aura!
He was about to break through!
Ye Xuan greedily took a deep breath, the blood in his body surging. Powerful auras gushed out of his body, causing the entire starry sky to boil!
Opposite Ye Xuan, the Dao Ancestor was expressionless, "Want to break through?
You're dreaming! "
As soon as he spoke, something appeared on the battlefield. The expressions of everyone in the Fifth Dimension changed drastically.
Chi Yaoyao and the others also changed drastically …

Chapter 1407
The reason Chi Yaoyao and the others were shocked was because two figures had appeared behind Ye Xuan.
These two figures were actually at the Dao Completion Realm!
Another two at the Dao Completion Realm!
Daoting didn't only have two at the Dao Completion Realm, but four!
When they saw this scene, many experts of the Fifth Dimension already felt despair!
If there were only two at the Dao Completion Realm, then the Fifth Dimension could still fight them. But now, there were four. How could they fight?
They couldn't fight at all!
The two Dao Completion Realm experts charged at Ye Xuan as soon as they appeared!
Obviously, they didn't want to give Ye Xuan any chance!
This was normal, because no one knew what would happen if Ye Xuan reached the Dao Resistance Realm!
The best way was to kill him before he broke through!
Nearby, when they saw the two Dao Attainment Realm experts and the Dao Ancestor charge towards Ye Xuan, the expressions of An Lanxiu and the other women instantly changed, and they charged directly towards Ye Xuan. However, it was utterly too late!
Because the speed of the Dao Ancestor and the two Dao Attainment experts was simply too fast!
The Lord and the others were also looking at Ye Xuan.
If the person behind Ye Xuan didn't appear, then Ye Xuan would basically be gone!
Right at this moment, the three Dao Ancestors who were charging at Ye Xuan seemed to have noticed something. Their expressions changed drastically, and they retreated like madmen!
Om!
An ear piercing sword howl suddenly resounded!
The Lord's eyes narrowed. "This …"
Not far away, over a dozen strands of sword qi were circling around Ye Xuan.
This wasn't Ye Xuan's sword qi!
It was the sword qi that Ye Xuan had brought out of the Dark Realm. Who was the owner of this sword qi?
It was Situ Tingyun!
Besides the green-clothed man, she was the strongest in the Sword Dao in the Sword Sect!
Even though these strands of sword qi were ownerless, they were still very powerful!
In the distance, the three Dao Ancestors had extremely solemn expressions!
It was especially so for the Dao Ancestor. His expression was unprecedentedly solemn.
He had seen such a powerful Sword Qi once before, from Mu Niannian.
And now, he saw it again!
And this Sword Qi was clearly not Mu Niannian's Sword Qi!
In other words, behind Ye Xuan, there was a powerful Swordsman who was no weaker than Mu Niannian!
On the other side, Qing Yaoyao suddenly said, "The sword qi in the dark world vortex!"
Rahu nodded. "I didn't expect him to be able to use this Sword Qi … This guy is too mysterious!"
The Lord looked at the Sword Qi and fell into deep thought.
Not far away, Ye Xuan closed his eyes. At this moment, he felt that he had reached a critical point.
The breakthrough was imminent!
At that moment, the nearby Dao Ancestor suddenly said, "This Sword Qi has no owner!"
Ownerless Sword Qi!
In other words, if the Sword Qi was destroyed, there would be nothing left!
The Dao Ancestor was about to make a move when Ye Xuan suddenly opened his eyes. "How do you know it has no owner?"
The Dao Ancestor stared at Ye Xuan. "If it has a owner, why don't you let the Sword Qi's owner come out?"
Ye Xuan smiled. "Dao Ancestor, aren't you thinking too highly of yourself?
Are you worthy of letting the Sword Qi's owner come out? "
The Dao Ancestor was expressionless. "Ye Xuan, at this point, is there any use in using words?
If you have someone, then call them out! "
Ye Xuan laughed. "Dao Ancestor, are you afraid?"
The Dao Ancestor looked at Ye Xuan and was about to speak. At that moment, a Dao Attainment expert suddenly said, "He's stalling for time!"
Stalling for time!
The Dao Ancestor narrowed his eyes. At this moment, Ye Xuan's aura was unprecedentedly powerful!
He was about to break through!
The Dao Ancestor suddenly said, "Destroy the Sword Qi first!"
With that, he charged at Ye Xuan!
The other two Dao Fulfilment experts also rushed over!
Meanwhile, the Sword Qi around Ye Xuan slashed out! Hiss!
Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!
Over a dozen Sword Qi tore through the starry sky. It was extremely terrifying!
It had to be said that the Dao Ancestor and the other two Dao Attainment experts were suppressed by the Sword Qi!
Even the Dao Ancestor and the other two Dao Attainment experts didn't dare to go head-on against the Sword Qi!
On the other side, the Lord said softly, "A single Sword Qi that hasn't been destroyed for tens of thousands of years, and it's so powerful …. It's ridiculously powerful!"
Luo Hou and the others didn't look too good!
They were supposed to be the strongest experts in this world. But after seeing the Sword Qi, they suddenly realized that they were really weak!
Not only was the Sword Qi indestructible for tens of thousands of years, but it was also so powerful!
Peak?
What they thought was the pinnacle was just a joke to some people!
It was like that to Mu Niannian, and it was the same to the Sword Qi's owner!
In the distance, after the Dao Ancestor and the other two Dao Attainment experts were stalled by the Sword Qi, Ye Xuan began to break through to the Dao Attainment Realm!
He had to reach the Dao Attainment Realm. Once he did, his overall strength would undergo a qualitative transformation!
At this moment, the Dao Ancestor and the other two Dao Attainment experts were burning with anxiety!
If Ye Xuan reached the Dao Attainment Realm, Ye Xuan wouldn't be able to fight against the three of them alone. However, once he reached the Dao Attainment Realm, he would become an unknown variable.
Who knew what would happen after he reached the Dao Attainment Realm?
Not far away, the Dao Ancestor and the other two Dao Attainment experts began to use their full strength. Although the Sword Qi suppressed the three Dao Ancestors, it was becoming more and more illusory.
After all, it was ownerless Sword Qi that could be consumed and destroyed.
On the other side, the battle between the experts of the Fifth Dimension and the experts of the Dao Court was in full swing. The experts of the Fifth Dimension were at a slight disadvantage, but because of the twelve Naga Dragon souls, the experts of the Fifth Dimension were only at a slight disadvantage.
This was because the twelve Naga Dragon souls were really too powerful!
In order to deal with the twelve Naga Dragon souls, the Daoting had mobilized a total of twenty-six Divine Sovereigns. Moreover, these twenty-six Divine Sovereigns were being suppressed by the twelve Naga Dragon souls!
In addition, Li Zuo and the other two Dao Ancestors were also extremely powerful. The three of them were forcefully holding back eleven Divine Sovereigns!
It could be said that it would be difficult to determine the victor between the two sides in a short period of time.
However, the situation was becoming more and more disadvantageous for Ye Xuan's side. This was because two of Ye Xuan's dozen Sword Qis had already disappeared!
Although the Sword Qis were powerful, they were ownerless. If they were consumed too much, they would completely disappear.
Now, the Dao Ancestors and the other two Dao Ancestors were madly consuming these Sword Qis!
On the other side, Luo Hou said softly, "He's about to break through!"
Just as he finished speaking —
Boom!
In the distance, a powerful aura suddenly erupted from Ye Xuan's body. Wherever this aura passed, the surrounding starry sky trembled.
Dao Attainment Realm!
Seeing that Ye Xuan was breaking through, Luo Hou shook his head, "This guy breaks through like eating. It's really infuriating to compare oneself with others!"
The Lord smiled, "He risked his life!"
Chi Yaoyao suddenly said, "Does the Daoting still have a trump card?"
The Lord looked at Chi Yaoyao and smiled, "You want to help!"
Chi Yaoyao said softly, "Why not?"
The Lord smiled, "If we help Ye Xuan, even if the Daoting has a trump card, we can still destroy the Daoting!
Of course, we will just have to pay a price! "
Chi Yaoyao looked at the Lord, "Does the Lord not choose to help because you have other concerns?"
The Lord looked at the faraway Ye Xuan and said softly, "He is a whirlpool. If we get too involved, it will be difficult for us to escape in the future."
Chi Yaoyao was silent.
She knew that the Lord was talking about the reason for Ye Xuan's misfortune.
The Lord was worried about this!
At this moment, the Lord suddenly smiled, "Let's wait and see!"
In the distance, after Ye Xuan broke through, he waved his right hand and the ten sword energies suddenly flew back in front of him!
Seeing this, the Dao Ancestor and the others' expressions became even uglier.
It wasn't because of Ye Xuan's breakthrough, but because Ye Xuan could control the ten sword energies!
After all, these ten sword energies weren't Ye Xuan's own sword energies!
Ye Xuan greedily took a deep breath!
Dao Defense Realm!
After reaching the Dao Defense Realm, he felt that everything was different!
His divine soul, divine sense, strength, and his own body, everything had undergone earth-shattering changes!
As if thinking of something, Ye Xuan suddenly looked at the Dao Ancestor. The next moment, he appeared in front of the Dao Ancestor and slashed down with his sword!
Dao Sword!
And four more domains!
The Dao Ancestor narrowed his eyes, took a step forward, and pointed out with a finger.
Head-On!
At this moment, Ye Xuan's sword fell.
Boom!
Under the gazes of everyone!
The Dao Ancestor was instantly pushed over 1km back, and his right index finger had been severed by Ye Xuan's attack. Besides that, his right arm had split open and blood sprayed from it!
The expressions of everyone here became solemn when they witnessed this scene!
The Lord frowned slightly as well. Isn't Ye Xuan's strength a little too exaggerated after he attained the Dao Defense Realm?
He'd injured a Dao Ancestor with a single strike of his sword!
Meanwhile, Yan Yaoyao suddenly said, "It's his body!"
The Lord gazed at Ye Xuan and spoke softly, "What formidable physical strength!
What cultivation technique does he cultivate? His body is actually so strong! "
Ye Xuan's combat strength had risen by so much mainly because of his physical body!
Dao Defense!
Now, Ye Xuan hadn't just attained the Dao Defense Realm in terms of physical body, his cultivation had as well!
It wasn't as simple as one plus one!
The Dao Ancestor stared fixedly at Ye Xuan from afar, and he was extremely shocked!
How could Ye Xuan's combat strength be so great after attaining the Dao Defense Realm?
The Dao Ancestor restrained his thoughts and glanced at the two others, "Let's attack together!"
As soon as he finished speaking, he charged forward!
The other two experts at the Dao Formation Realm attacked as well!
Three experts at the Dao Formation Realm attacked together!
Ye Xuan took a step forward and slashed with his sword.
Bang!
His attack blasted the Dao Ancestor back, but it only took a moment for two fists to smash against Ye Xuan's chest and head!
Bang!
Ye Xuan's figure was instantly blasted flying, and he flew for over 3km!
After he stopped moving, Ye Xuan felt dizzy. Meanwhile, the two Dao Formation Realm experts appeared in front of him again. Ye Xuan's expression changed slightly, and he swung his sword horizontally.
Bang!
An expanse of sword light exploded apart, and then Ye Xuan was blasted flying again. Meanwhile, the Dao Ancestor suddenly appeared in front of Ye Xuan, and he suddenly swung his fist at Ye Xuan!
Bang!
The starry sky trembled as his fist smashed forward.
Meanwhile, Ye Xuan suddenly opened his palm, and then Situ Tingyun's 10 strands of sword energy suddenly slashed forward!
The Dao Ancestor's expression changed drastically when he witnessed this scene, and he immediately retreated explosively!
The other two Dao Formation Realm experts hurriedly retreated as well!
Situ Tingyun's sword energy was capable of killing them!
Ye Xuan wiped off the blood on the corners of his mouth with a solemn expression on his face.
Even though he'd attained the Dao Defense Realm, he was still unable to fight three enemies by himself!
Should I activate the energy of my bloodline?
Ye Xuan slowly closed his eyes!
The energy of his bloodline had gone completely berserk, and it was his final trump card!
The Dao Ancestor stared fixedly at Ye Xuan from afar, and he was even more shocked by Ye Xuan's physical body!
Ye Xuan had just suffered the full forced attacks of two Dao Formation Realm experts, yet he was still alive and well!
What sort of physical body is this?
Meanwhile, one of the Dao Formation Realm experts by the Dao Ancestor's side spoke abruptly, "We can't delay any longer!
If we continue to delay, then both our forces and the Fifth Dimension will suffer heavy losses!
Moreover, I'm afraid an unexpected event might occur! "
The Dao Ancestor turned around to look. At this moment, the experts of the Fifth Dimension were locked in battle with the experts of the Daoting Realm!
If this continued, then both sides would suffer heavy losses!
After all, the Daoting Realm had another enemy, and it was the Dao Tomb!
As for the three of them, although they could defeat Ye Xuan, Ye Xuan had the Sword Qi and Ye Xuan's powerful physical body, so they wouldn't be able to kill Ye Xuan in a short period of time!
Thinking to this point, the Dao Ancestor looked at Ye Xuan. "Ye Xuan, I originally prepared a big gift for the woman behind you, but since she won't appear, then I'll give it to you!"
As he spoke, he opened his palm, and the next moment, a golden light soared into the sky from the thirty-fourth layer of the Daoting Realm. In the blink of an eye, this golden light appeared in the starry sky of the Fifth Dimension.
In an instant, the entire starry sky trembled.
Inside that golden light was a God's Seal!
Inside that God's Seal, an illusory figure gradually condensed. As this illusory figure condensed, a formless pressure enveloped the entire Fifth Dimension!
Under this pressure, everyone felt like they were suffocating!
Even Ye Xuan felt a tightness in his chest at this moment, as if there were several mountains pressing down on him.
On the other side, the Lord's expression also became incomparably solemn. "The head of the Three Thousand Great Daos …"
.....







Chapter 1408
Three Thousand Great Daos!
The Three Thousand Great Daos represented three thousand different Great Daos. Of course, there were far more than three thousand Great Daos in the world.
And among these Great Daos, there were strong and weak ones!
The first was the Great Dao of Destiny!
The foremost of the Three Thousand Great Daos!
The Dao Ancestor didn't control the Great Dao of Destiny. However, someone in the Daoting had once controlled the Great Dao, and that person was the founder of the Daoting!
Daoting's strongest trump card was not the two hidden Dao Realm powerhouses, but the God's Seal!
That was because the Daoting Ancestral Souls were inside!
This was Daoting's last resort!
Originally, he was saving it for the mysterious woman in a plain dress behind Ye Xuan.
However, the woman in a plain dress didn't show herself. For the sake of swiftly killing Ye Xuan, he could only utilize this trump card first!
In the distance, Ye Xuan stared at the silhouette within the God's Seal. Although his countenance was calm, his heart was thundering with rage. Dammit, he's summoning the ancestor again?
At this moment, everyone stopped what they were doing!
There was no need to fight!
If Ye Xuan's side didn't have a heavyweight expert, then it would be over!
It didn't take long for a woman to appear within the seal!
The woman was dressed in a long black robe. Her features were picturesque, and she held a black folding fan in her hand.
After the woman appeared, she looked around and looked at the Dao Ancestor. However, as if she had discovered something, she suddenly turned to look at Ye Xuan below.
Seeing this scene, the Dao Ancestor's expression suddenly changed. My ancestor knows this Ye Xuan?
Ye Xuan was slightly stunned. This Daoting Ancestor knew him?
In the air, the woman looked at Ye Xuan. "Dao Form!"
Dao Body!
Upon hearing this, Ye Xuan's expression instantly changed!
Damn it, this woman doesn't recognize me, but she recognizes my Taoist form!
The woman suddenly smiled and said, "Interesting, I didn't expect someone to have cultivated a Dao Body!
How interesting! "
On the other side, the Dao Ancestor bowed slightly to the woman. "Ancestor, what is this Dao Body?"
The woman glanced at the Dao Ancestor. "Did you summon me?"
The Dao Ancestor quickly nodded.
The woman turned to look at Ye Xuan. She gently tapped the folding fan in her right hand on the palm of her left hand and said with a smile, "You are also a protector!"
Ye Xuan said nothing.
The Dao Ancestor's expression changed drastically. Just as he was about to speak, the woman suddenly said, "To be able to cultivate a Dao Body and possess a Disaster Cause … Young man, you are not simple at all!"
Ye Xuan hurriedly said, "To tell you the truth, I am the young sect master of Whirling Sect!"
The woman blinked. "Whirling Sect?
Are you sure? "
Ye Xuan said seriously, "Of course!"
The woman smiled and said, "It just so happens that I am acquainted with the Whirling Sect's Sect Leader. Let me ask him!"
As she spoke, she turned her head and kissed him.
Below, Ye Xuan: "…"
After a while, the woman turned her head and looked at Ye Xuan. "The Whirling Sect's Sect Master said that there's no such person as you!"
Ye Xuan hesitated for a moment and said, "Why don't we change the topic?"
The woman was stunned, and then she cracked a smile. It was like a hundred flowers blooming, causing the starry sky to pale in comparison.
At the side, the Dao Ancestor said in a low voice, "Ancestor, this person is a great enemy of my Daoting. I …"
The woman looked at the Dao Ancestor. "Don't speak for now!"
The Dao Ancestor: "…"
The woman turned to look at Ye Xuan and said with a smile, "Not only did you cultivate a Dao Body, you were also able to live until now despite having a Disaster Cause … The most important thing is the power of your bloodline. Your bloodline is the strongest power I have ever seen!
！”
Ye Xuan hurriedly took out the Sword Spirit and the sword at the top of the pagoda. "Senior, why don't you take a look at this!"
The woman glanced at the two swords and said with a smile, "Are you threatening me?"
Ye Xuan shook his head. "Senior, not only do you Daoting want to destroy me, but you also want to destroy my Five-Dimensional Universe. Now, you have even invited you out … Tell me, who is threatening who?"
The woman turned to look at the Dao Ancestor. "You want to destroy this universe?"
The Dao Ancestor's expression was somewhat ugly.
The woman asked with a smile, "As the guardian of the Great Dao, shouldn't you be maintaining the balance and peace of the universe?"
The Dao Ancestor's expression became even uglier.
The woman looked at the Dao Ancestor and the others below and said with a smile, "It seems that you have turned the Three Thousand Great Dao into your personal tools!"
Hearing this, the expressions of all the Daoting powerhouses below became extremely ugly!
What a heart-wrenching remark!
The woman looked at Dao Ting and the others. "The Great Dao once chose all of you. It's obvious that all of you are outstanding in some way. However, from the looks of it now, all of you are still going with the flow and have forgotten your original intentions!"
The Dao Ancestor suddenly said, "Ancestor, this Ye Xuan is a great enemy of the Daoting. This person once swore to destroy the Daoting, I …"
The woman looked at the Dao Ancestor and said with a smile, "Can you tell me why he did this?"
The Dao Ancestor was speechless.
The woman said again, "Everything has a reason. Why did he want to destroy the Daoting? Can you tell me?"
The Dao Ancestor was speechless.
At this time, Ye Xuan suddenly said, "Why don't I tell you!"
The woman looked at Ye Xuan and said with a smile, "That's fine too!"
Ye Xuan nodded. He told the whole story of the grudge between him and the Daoting without adding any details.
The atmosphere in the surroundings had become slightly strange!
This woman was originally called out by the Daoting to deal with Ye Xuan. But now, this woman was listening to Ye Xuan talk about the Daoting …
Whose ancestor was this?
The Dao Ancestor's face was gloomy. No one knew what he was thinking.
On the other side, Rahu looked at the Great Lord. "Great Lord, this …"
The Great Lord said softly, "The Dao Ancestor has miscalculated!
Back then, the Great Dao Guardians of that generation were all impartial … Those people were righteous and paid attention to fairness in everything. Because of this, there were all kinds of orders in that era … "
As he said that, he looked at the Dao Ancestor. "He thought that the Daoting ancestor would help him, but that's not the case. The Daoting ancestor paid more attention to right and wrong.
And this matter is obviously the Daoting is not in the right.
So, there's going to be a good show! "
At this time, Ye Xuan stopped in the distance.
The woman turned to look at the Dao Ancestor. "Did this little friend Ye slander the Daoting?"
The Dao Ancestor did not say anything.
The woman suddenly waved her right hand.
Smack!
Under everyone's shocked gazes, the Dao Ancestor was sent flying with a slap!
He flew more than 10,000 feet, and when he came to a stop, his fleshly body became illusory!
He shattered his body with a slap!
Seeing this scene, everyone's expression changed!
Ye Xuan's expression also changed. Damn, how could this woman be so strong?
If he were to be slapped, wouldn't his Daoist Physique be destroyed?
The woman turned to look at Ye Xuan and said with a smile, "This matter is the Daoting's fault. On behalf of the Daoting, I apologize to you and the entire Fifth Dimension!"
Everyone: "…"
Ye Xuan was also dumbfounded.
The enemy's biggest boss apologized to him?
What was going on?
Ye Xuan hesitated for a while and then said.
"Why?
Shouldn't you be helping the Daoting? "
The woman shook her head. "Logically, I should be helping the Daoting!
But, the Daoting is not in the right! "
Ye Xuan looked at the woman. "You're being reasonable?"
The woman said with a smile, "Why not?
The Three Thousand Great Daos are a kind of order. As the guardian of the order, if you are unreasonable, who will obey the order? "
Ye Xuan shook his head. "In today's world, only fists matter, not reason!"
The woman looked at Ye Xuan. "Then, are you interested in rebuilding the order?"
Ye Xuan looked at the woman. "Do you want me to be the Daoting Master?"
The woman said with a smile, "Can't I?"
Ye Xuan shook his head. "Senior, my mind is in a mess right now!"
The boss of the Daoting Master actually wanted him to be the Daoting Master!
What was going on?
The woman said with a smile, "Do you have five Daoist scriptures on you?"
Ye Xuan nodded.
The woman said again, "There should be two Daoting Masters. With these two, you have seven!"
At this moment, the Lord suddenly said with a smile, "My Dao Tomb also has one. With this one, Young Master Ye has eight!"
The woman looked at the Lord. The Lord bowed slightly. "Greetings, Ancestor!"
The woman said with a smile, "You used to be a Daoting Master?"
The Lord nodded. "Yes!
However, I rebelled later on!
Because Daoting is not the Daoting I once thought of.
Of course, this has nothing to do with Ancestor. I admire what Ancestor did just now. "
The woman smiled and looked at Ye Xuan. "As long as you nod, you can have eight Daoist scriptures. So, what do you think?"
Ye Xuan looked at the woman. "Why did you choose me?"
The woman blinked and said playfully, "Do you want to hear the truth or a lie?"
Ye Xuan thought for a while and said, "Lie first!"
The woman said with a smile, "You are a rare genius. With you, we can revitalize Daoting and rebuild order …"
Ye Xuan smiled. "What about the truth?"
The woman looked at Ye Xuan. "You have many backers!"
Ye Xuan was speechless.
The woman said again, "It is not particularly difficult to revitalize Daoting. However, it is very difficult to gather all the Daoist scriptures and summon the Great Dao Spirit. To restore the 3,000 Great Dao and rebuild order, we must gather all the Daoist scriptures and summon the Great Dao Spirit.
However, ordinary people cannot do this. "
Ye Xuan was puzzled. "Why is it so difficult?"
The woman said with a smile, "There are three difficulties. First, the last Daoist scripture is in Whirling World. That place is not something you can provoke now.
Second, many people will not let you gather all the Daoist scriptures. For example, Whirling World, Dark Abyss and Ancient God Abyss … If these forces know that you have eight Daoist scriptures, they will be jealous. Once they are jealous, you will be in danger!
Third, even if you gather all eight Daoist scriptures, the Great Dao Spirit may not recognize you. It might even kill you! "
Ye Xuan was puzzled. "Why would it kill me?"
The woman shook her head. "You will know this in the future!
I can only tell you that it is very difficult to gather all the Daoist scriptures and get the Great Dao Spirit's recognition! "
Ye Xuan said in a deep voice, "Senior, do you think I can get the Great Dao Spirit's recognition?"
The woman blinked. "I don't know if she will recognize you. However, I know that she will not dare to kill you!"
Ye Xuan frowned. "Why?"
The woman said, "Because you have many backers!"
Ye Xuan was speechless.
....
PS: Don't say that I am threatening you. If you don't give me the ticket, I will castrate myself!







Chapter 1409
Many backers!
Ye Xuan was speechless. What was she talking about?
In the starry sky, the woman smiled and said, "What if I don't agree?"
Ye Xuan looked at the woman and said, "What if I don't agree?"
The woman blinked her eyes and said, "You will agree!"
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "Why?"
The woman said, "Because you have no reason to refuse!"
Ye Xuan shook his head and said, "I only want to protect the Five-Dimensional Universe!"
The woman smiled and said, "If you want to protect the universe behind you, then become the Daoting Master and you will be able to protect it better!"
Ye Xuan pointed at the Daoting experts in the distance and said, "They will not accept me!"
The woman pointed at herself and said, "I approve of you!"
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "Then can you make them approve of me?"
The woman asked, "If I approve of you, will they dare to not approve of you?"
Ye Xuan was silent.
The woman said again, "Young man, I don't have much time left!"
Ye Xuan looked at the woman and she continued, "While I am still here, I can help you. Therefore, you must make a decision!"
Ye Xuan was silent.
The woman smiled and said, "I still have about a quarter of an hour. Want to walk with me?"
Ye Xuan thought about it and said, "Okay!"
The woman and Ye Xuan walked towards the starry sky in the distance.
In the field, the Daoting experts looked at each other in dismay.
The Dao Ancestor who only had his soul left had a gloomy expression and no one knew what he was thinking.
In the distant starry sky, the woman pointed and said, "In the distant starry sky, there is a mysterious force called the Ancient God Abyss. The weakest in this force is the Dao Attainment Realm and there are experts above the Dao Attainment Realm!"
Ye Xuan said in a deep voice, "Are they outside the Dao Scripture?"
The woman shook her head and said, "They are within the Dao Scripture!"
Ye Xuan frowned and said, "Experts above the Dao Attainment Realm are also within the Dao Scripture?"
The woman nodded and said, "Yes."
Ye Xuan was silent.
He had underestimated this Dao scripture!
The woman continued: "This power has been fighting against a mysterious power all year round. This mysterious power is called Dark Abyss. This place is very terrifying because a monstrous genius once appeared in this place. This person is called Second Brother Dao. Back then, he created a Dark Scripture based on the Dao Scripture!"
Ye Xuan frowned. "Secret scripture?"
The woman nodded, "It was created according to the Dao Scripture … The people of the Dark World all cultivate the Dark Scripture. As far as I know, they have two goals. First, they want to destroy the Dao Scripture Martial Arts Civilization and make the Dark Scripture Martial Arts Civilization the only one. Second, they want to destroy the Great Dao Spirit."
As she spoke, she looked at Shen Xiang. "Do you know why the Dao Scripture is divided into nine parts?"
Ye Xuan shook his head.
The woman replied: "Because the Dao Scripture was destroyed by the people of the Dark Abyss!"
Ye Xuan was speechless.
The woman suddenly asked, "Are you willing to give up on the Dao scriptures?"
Ye Xuan was silent.
The woman smiled and said, "Looks like you are not willing to give up!
Actually, if I were you, I wouldn't give up either.
Why?
Because even if you give up, they might not let you go!
In this world, being weak is a mistake and a sin! "
Ye Xuan gave a thumbs up. "Senior's words are brilliant!"
The woman laughed and gently fanned Ye Xuan's head. "Don't play tricks!
I told you so much because I want to tell you that you will always be the Dao Scripture. One day, you will face the Dark Abyss!
If you become the Lord of the Daoting, the forces you control will become even stronger. After all, the Daoting's overall forces are still very strong, right? "
It's very strong, right? "
Ye Xuan was silent.
The woman continued: "Moreover, if you become the Lord of the Daoting, you will immediately have two Dao Scriptures!
Apart from that, I can give you a surprise! "
Ye Xuan was curious. "Surprise?"
The woman smiled and said, "It is in the 34th Heaven of the Daoting!"
Ye Xuan looked at the woman. "Senior, you really want me to become the Lord of the Daoting. Why is that?"
The woman smiled and did not say anything.
Ye Xuan said, "Senior, can you tell me the truth?"
The woman nodded and looked at Ye Xuan. "There is a bad karma between you and the Daoting. I want to turn this bad karma into good karma. Of course, I feel that you are also the hope to save the Daoting. After all, the Daoting now is not the Daoting of the past. However, I feel that even if you cannot restore order to this world, you should be able to make the Daoting better!"
Ye Xuan looked at the woman and did not say anything.
The woman smiled and said, "Otherwise, what do you think I am scheming?"
Ye Xuan shook his head. "I don't know!"
The woman continued to walk forward. "My generation has sacrificed too much for the order of this world. I don't want to see the Daoting continue to decline, and I don't want to see the Daoting perish."
Ye Xuan asked, "Senior, have you fallen?"
The woman smiled and did not say anything.
Ye Xuan asked again, "No?"
The woman smiled and said, "You care a lot about me?"
Ye Xuan was speechless.
The woman stopped and looked at Ye Xuan. "How is it? Have you thought it through?"
Ye Xuan was silent.
At this moment, the woman suddenly said, "Nian Nian!"
Ye Xuan looked at the woman. The woman smiled and said, "That Fifth Dimension Tendo is still alive, right?"
Ye Xuan said in a deep voice, "What do you mean, Senior?"
The woman looked at Ye Xuan. "Do you really think that her death was because of my Daoting?"
Ye Xuan clenched his fists. "What do you mean, Senior?"
The woman smiled and said, "She did not die because of Daoting. She died because of you!"
Ye Xuan stared at the woman. "Why do you say that?"
The woman pointed at Ye Xuan. "The Cause of Calamity!
She has helped you too much!
Not only did she help you too much, but she also forcefully interfered with your Cause of Calamity, helping you block some of the Calamity Karma that originally belonged to you … In short, you just need to understand one thing. The Cause of Calamity on you is not as simple as you think. You want to protect the entire Fifth Dimension, so your Cause of Calamity is very likely to implicate the entire Fifth Dimension! "
Ye Xuan said, "Then, Senior, aren't you afraid that I will implicate Daoting?"
The woman smiled and said, "There are no absolutes in everything!
You can cause the Fifth Dimension and Daoting to perish together, but you can also cause the Fifth Dimension and Daoting to become even more powerful! "
Ye Xuan was silent.
The woman opened her palm, and a God's Seal appeared in her hand. She handed the God's Seal to Ye Xuan. "This is the first of the 3,000 Grand Daos, the Grand Dao of Destiny!
It will fuse with you, allowing you to slowly comprehend the Dao of Destiny. You will also be able to use it to achieve Dao in a short period of time! "
Dao Realm!
Ye Xuan was silent.
The woman continued, "If you want to protect the Fifth Dimension and protect your Sister Nian, you will need to obtain even more power!"
Ye Xuan softly said, "It seems that I am being unreasonable!"
As he spoke, he received the God's Seal.
The woman smiled and said, "It is not unreasonable, but you are very cautious. If I am not wrong, you should be afraid that I will plot against you!
I can also tell you that I am indeed plotting against you! "
Ye Xuan looked at the woman and said, "Senior, will we meet in the future?"
The woman smiled and said, "It is up to you!"
At this moment, Ye Xuan knew that the woman in front of him was not dead!
The woman continued, "Let me tell you a piece of bad news. The Whirling World should already know that you have the Five Dao Scriptures!"
Ye Xuan was struck dumb. Then he asked, "Why?"
The woman looked at Ye Xuan and smiled and said, "Because I have communicated with the Whirling World before. With the strength of the Whirling World, they should be able to sense the aura of the Five Dao Scriptures!
After all, you were so close to me at that time! "
Ye Xuan: "…"
The woman smiled and said, "This is the price you have to pay for deceiving me. Lying has a price!"
Ye Xuan's face was full of black lines.
The woman glanced at her body. At this moment, her body was quickly becoming illusory.
The woman smiled and said, "It is going to disappear!
Do you have any questions?
If there is, I will answer them if I can! "
Ye Xuan asked in a deep voice, "Where is Senior now?"
The woman shook her head, "I can't answer!"
Ye Xuan frowned slightly, "Why?"
The woman smiled and said, "There is no why, I just can't answer!
You can ask the next question.
Of course, you can also choose not to ask! "
Ye Xuan thought for a moment and said, "How should I address you, Senior?"
The woman looked at Ye Xuan and smiled meaningfully, "What do you want to do?"
Ye Xuan hurriedly said, "I don't mean anything else. I just want to ask!
You can't answer this? "
The woman laughed and said, "There is no harm in telling you!
My name is Zhao Zhiqing. Most people call me Qing Zhu. In fact, very few people know my real name! "
Zhao Zhiqing!
Ye Xuan nodded slightly, "I will remember it!"
The woman looked at Ye Xuan and smiled, "I have two bad news. Do you want to hear it?"
Bad news!
Ye Xuan frowned slightly, "What bad news?"
The woman said, "The first bad news is that the Taoist Ancestor ran away!"
Ye Xuan frowned slightly. The woman said softly, "The second bad news is that someone helped him escape. And this person should be someone from the Dark World!
Of course, there is even worse news. The two Taoist scriptures were taken away by the Taoist Ancestor! "
Ye Xuan immediately jumped up, "Senior, why didn't you stop them!"
The woman was a little helpless, "I talked too much with you!"
Ye Xuan, "…"
The woman smiled and said, "Don't be angry!
What is yours is still yours. What is not yours, you can't take it away! "
After saying that, her lower body disappeared.
Ye Xuan said in a deep voice, "Senior, can I call the ancestor in the future?
Can I summon you to help me? "
The woman blinked her eyes, "I'm afraid not!"
Ye Xuan was a little puzzled, "Why?"
The woman smiled and said, "Do you want to hear the truth or a lie?"
Ye Xuan said in a deep voice, "What is the lie?"
The woman said seriously, "The lie is that this is the last clone I left here. But now, this clone will disappear completely. So, you know!"
Ye Xuan was a little curious, "What is the truth?"
The woman looked at Ye Xuan and grinned, "The truth is that I don't want to have too much contact with you. I am afraid of bad luck. So, I refuse your summoning!
Bye bye! "
After saying that, she disappeared.
In the air, Ye Xuan was petrified …
.....







Chapter 1410
In the starry sky, Ye Xuan stood quietly, deep in thought.
It was very dramatic!
He did not expect that he would become the Lord of Daoting.
At this time, the Lord and the others suddenly appeared beside Ye Xuan. The Lord smiled. "Do you feel like it's a dream?"
Ye Xuan nodded. "A little!"
The Lord laughed. "I also feel like it's a dream!"
Just a moment ago, Ye Xuan and Daoting were mortal enemies. Now, Ye Xuan had become the Lord of Daoting.
This Dao Ancestor's Summoning directly killed himself and gave Daoting to Ye Xuan!
This operation was really rare!
Ye Xuan suddenly said. "Senior, is there a big difference between the Daoting of the past and the Daoting of the present?"
The Lord smiled. "There is no comparison at all. The Great Dao was once complete and there was order in the world. Good will be rewarded and evil will be punished … The reason why it could be like this was because the Great Dao Guardians of Daoting were impartial and impartial.
At that time, no one dared to practice favoritism because if they did, not only would they be deprived of their Deity Position, but they would also fall into the evil path of reincarnation.
In that era, the price of doing evil was very high. Therefore, the Great Dao Guardians basically did not dare to do evil. "
Ye Xuan frowned. "Then why did Daoting become like this?"
The Lord said. "Because Qing Zhu and the others disappeared!"
Ye Xuan was puzzled. "Disappeared?
Left? "
The Lord said softly. "They should have left!
Anyway, after that group of people left, the people behind them began to take over Daoting. Unknowingly, Daoting began to slowly deteriorate.
Originally, the Dao Master position of Daoting was for the virtuous, but later on, this position became the private property of some people. They only passed it on to their own sons and it was passed down from generation to generation, including the Dao Ancestor just now. The reason why he could become the Lord of Daoting was because his father was the previous Dao Ancestor! "
Ye Xuan was silent.
The Lord laughed, "Now that you are the Lord of Daoting, you can change Daoting.
Also, be careful of the Dao Ancestor. He should have been rescued by the people from the Dark Abyss! "
An Abyss!
Ye Xuan said solemnly, "The people from the Dark Abyss saved him because of the two scriptures, right?"
The Lord nodded. "Yes!
After that, An Yuan will probably come looking for you! "
Ye Xuan was speechless.
The Lord flicked his finger and a Daoist scripture appeared in front of Ye Xuan. It was the sixth scripture.
The Lord smiled and said, "I'll give it to you!
If you have time, come to the Dao Tomb to play! "
With that, he turned around and left.
Ye Xuan looked at the scripture in his hands, speechless.
The Lord was definitely afraid that the people from the Dark Abyss would come looking for him. That was why he gave the Dao Scripture to him so easily.
An Abyss!
Ye Xuan was silent for a moment before he turned around and left.
Somewhere in the starry sky, Su Ke looked away after Ye Xuan left.
In fact, he had come to the Fifth Dimension a long time ago. However, he did not make a move. He wanted to act at the crucial moment. He did not expect that after the Daoting Ancestor came out, the Daoting Ancestor would stand on Ye Xuan's side!
He did not expect this at all!
Of course, he did not expect that An Yuan would save the Dao Ancestor!
This meant that An Yuan would become enemies with Ye Xuan!
Thinking of this, Su Ke wanted to laugh.
Su Ke suddenly said, "Stay here and protect Young Master Ye. I will return to the Ancient God Abyss."
With that, he turned around and left.
....
On the other side, the Dao Ancestor, who was already a soul body, stood in the starry sky. Not far in front of him stood a middle-aged man in a black robe.
Dao
The Dao Ancestor looked at the middle-aged man in front of him. "An Yuan!"
The middle-aged man smiled. "You guessed it right. You can call me Lian Zun!"
The Dao Ancestor was expressionless. "You saved me for the two scriptures?"
Lian Zun smiled. "Will you give them to me?"
The Dao Ancestor laughed at himself. "Can I refuse?"
With that, he flicked his finger and two scriptures appeared in front of Lian Zun.
Lian Zun did not refuse and kept the two scriptures.
At this moment, the Dao Ancestor suddenly said, "Ye Xuan has five of them!"
Lian Zun glanced at the Dao Ancestor and smiled. "You want us to kill Ye Xuan!"
The Dao Ancestor smiled. "You wanted to go, didn't you?"
Lian Zun looked at the starry sky and said softly, "To be honest, we are here for Ye Xuan!
As far as we know, he is related to the Sword Sect, and the Sword Sect has a blood feud with An Yuan! "
The Dao Ancestor frowned. "Blood feud?"
Lian Zun said softly, "Back then, the Sword Sect's Ancestral Master, that female sword cultivator, not only killed dozens of our Dark Abyss experts, but she also brought her sword to our Dark Abyss …"
At this point, he didn't say anything else.
That incident back then could be said to be the Dark Abyss' humiliation!
The Dao Ancestor looked at Lian Zun. "I have to remind you that there is a little girl by Ye Xuan's side. Her name is Mu Niannian. Her strength is beyond your imagination. If you want to obtain the scriptures and kill Ye Xuan, you must be quick. Otherwise, once she regains her memory and strength, you will be like ants before her!"
Lian Zun said softly, "Are you talking about the Mu Niannian who shattered your body with less than 30% of her strength?"
The Dao Ancestor said, "Yes!"
Lian Zun was silent.
Coming to this place this time, many things and people were beyond his expectations!
Especially Ye Xuan. Ye Xuan's strength shocked him.
Although he was at the Dao Controlling Realm, Ye Xuan could totally become a Dao Realm expert. Most importantly, Ye Xuan's bloodline power and body were too terrifying!
The Dao Ancestor was about to speak, but Lian Zun smiled and said, "You don't have to sow discord. We will kill Ye Xuan because he is not only related to the Sword Sect, but also to the Ancient God Abyss. Therefore, he must die."
He shook his head and smiled. "To be honest, there are too many reasons to kill him!"
The Dao Ancestor slowly closed his eyes.
At this moment, he was the most indignant and aggrieved!
He had been holding back his ultimate move, but he did not expect that it would not only destroy him, but also help Ye Xuan!
Of course, he did not expect that the ancestor of Daoting would not help Daoting, but Ye Xuan!
And he even made Ye Xuan the Master of Daoting!
Every time he thought of this, his liver ached.
Angry!
At this moment, Lian Zun suddenly said, "Dao Ancestor, are you willing to go to the Dark Abyss?
If you are, we will help you to restore your body! "
The Dao Ancestor said softly, "Do I have the right to refuse?"
Lian Zun laughed. "Then we will be on the same side from now on!
Let's go! "
After saying this, he turned and left.
The Dao Ancestor turned and looked at the starry sky of the Fifth Dimension. His eyes gradually turned cold. "Ye Xuan, we will meet again!"
After saying this, he turned and left.
....
Ye Xuan returned to the starry sky of the Fifth Dimension. At this moment, some of the people of Daoting had left. Bai Dizi had also disappeared, but White Robe was still there.
Ye Xuan walked in front of the Daoting experts. Everyone was looking at Ye Xuan.
In fact, at this moment, they were already confused.
They were originally enemies with Ye Xuan, but with the appearance of their ancestor, everything changed!
The ancestor approved of Ye Xuan!
Could it be that they wanted to become enemies with the ancestor?
At this moment, White Robe suddenly walked in front of Ye Xuan. He looked at Ye Xuan without saying a word.
Ye Xuan suddenly smiled. "If you want to stay, you can stay. If you don't want to, you can leave immediately."
None of the Daoting experts moved.
Leave?
Where could they go?
At this moment, Ye Xuan opened his palm. A God's Seal appeared in his hand.
The Great Dao of Destiny!
The expressions of the 3 Dao Completion Realm experts instantly became extremely complicated when they witnessed this scene.
Their ancestor had passed this Great Dao Seal to Ye Xuan!
At this moment, Venerable Mi suddenly said, "Your Excellency … did the ancestor say anything?"
Ye Xuan looked at Venerable Mi. "She said that I should go find her in the future."
Venerable Mi was stunned, then bowed slightly. "This old man is willing to serve Your Excellency as my master!"
The other two Daoting experts bowed slightly as well.
When they saw the three Daoting experts bow, some of the Daoting experts who were watching hurriedly bowed as well.
The strongest three had already expressed their allegiance, so they naturally wouldn't hesitate any longer.
Ye Xuan slowly closed his eyes. "It's time for the Daoting to change!"
Venerable Mi hesitated for a moment and said, "I'm afraid it'll be difficult."
Ye Xuan gazed at Venerable Mi. "Do you want to change?"
Venerable Mi replied, "Rome wasn't built in a single day …"
Ye Xuan smiled. "Do you know why Big Sister Qing is so strong?"
Venerable Mi was stunned. "Big Sister Qing?"
Ye Xuan's expression didn't change. "Yes!
She asked me to call her Big Sister, and she said that she'll protect me from now on!
Is there a problem? "
Venerable Mi replied, "I … I have no problem …"
Ye Xuan glanced at the Daoting experts. Finally, he looked at White Robe. "White Robe, do you think the Daoting should change?"
White Robe looked at Ye Xuan. "You want me to submit?"
Ye Xuan smiled. "I don't want you to submit. However, I want to say that you don't have to fight for me. You can continue to fight for the Daoting."
White Robe was silent.
Ye Xuan asked. "Make your own decision!"
White Robe looked at Ye Xuan. "Bai Dizi asked me to follow you."
Bai Dizi!
Ye Xuan frowned slightly. He looked around. "Where is he?"
White Robe said indifferently, "He knows that you'll kill him, so he ran!"
Ye Xuan was silent.
He really wanted to kill Bai Dizi!
It was this person who had targeted him time and time again!
White Robe continued, "He said that the ancestor chose you for three reasons. First, the ancestor saw the strength of the person behind you. The strength of the person behind you is definitely beyond our imagination. Second, the ancestor wanted to end the bad karma between you and the Daoting, and turn this bad karma into good karma. Third, the ancestor chose you because she wanted you to change the Daoting and rebuild the order of the Great Dao. In other words, she felt that you could change the Daoting and rebuild the order of the Great Dao."
Ye Xuan was silent.
White Robe continued, "He also said that I can not fight for you, but I can continue to fight for the Daoting.
And if you, Ye Xuan, can gather the Dao Scriptures, it will be a great thing for me and the whole of the Daoting!
So … "
Saying that, he looked at Ye Xuan. "I will fight for the Daoting!"
.....







Chapter 1411
Fight for Daoting!
Following White Robe's declaration, the Daoting powerhouses under him also declared their allegiance.
In the Daoting, White Robe's prestige was second only to the Dao Ancestor, especially in the Celestial Abyss, where his White Robe Army was invincible.
And these people were even more loyal to White Robe than to the Dao Ancestor.
With White Robe and the others' submission, the entire Daoting was now truly under Ye Xuan's control.
At this time, Luo Hou and the others walked over. He looked at Ye Xuan and smiled. "Congratulations!"
The current Ye Xuan could be said to be on equal footing with the Dao Tomb Land!
No, with Ye Xuan's participation, the Daoting's strength could completely suppress the Dao Tomb Land!
Ye Xuan smiled. "Senior Luo Hou, the cooperation I've discussed with the Dao Tomb Land is still valid!"
Luo Hou's heart immediately relaxed. He smiled. "That's good!"
Ye Xuan looked up into the depths of the starry sky and said softly, "To Daoting!"
To Daoting!
He did not forget that Zhao Zhiqing had left him a surprise in the 34th Heaven!
Soon, Ye Xuan left the Fifth Dimension with everyone and headed for the Daoting.
In the starry sky, Luo Hou and the others watched Ye Xuan and the others leave with complicated expressions.
They never imagined that Ye Xuan would directly become the master of the Daoting!
Fortunately, Ye Xuan did not become enemies with the Dao Tomb Land. Otherwise, the Dao Tomb Land would be in an awkward situation.
After a moment, Luo Hou said, "Let's go!"
With that, he turned and left with Chi Yaoyao and the others.
...
Daoting.
Ye Xuan once again came to the Daoting. Unlike before, this time, he came openly.
Ye Xuan headed straight for the 34th level of heaven.
On the way, Ye Xuan suddenly asked, "Do you know what's inside the Thirty-fourth Heaven?"
Beside Ye Xuan, Venerated Mi shook his head. "We only know that it is the place where the Great Dao Seal is stored. We don't know anything else."
Ye Xuan looked at Venerable Mi. "You've never been inside?"
Venerable Mi nodded, "I've never entered before!"
Ye Xuan was puzzled. "Why?"
Venerable Mi hesitated for a moment and said, "I wouldn't dare to disturb you, Ancestor!"
Upon hearing this, Ye Xuan understood.
In the hearts of the Daoting people, Zhao Zhiqing's position was still very high.
Soon, Ye Xuan arrived at the entrance to the Thirty-fourth Heaven.
Back then, Sister Nian had come here, but she hadn't entered.
Now that he thought about it, Sister Nian must have felt Zhao Zhiqing's presence.
Sister Nian's strength was definitely not weaker than Zhao Zhiqing's, but at that time, Sister Nian only had less than 30% of her strength. Moreover, Sister Nian's main target was the Dao Ancestor!
Ye Xuan collected his thoughts and walked towards the Thirty-fourth Heaven!
Venerable Mi and the rest did not follow.
Soon, Ye Xuan arrived at the Thirty-fourth Heaven. The entire Thirty-fourth Heaven was empty. There was nothing there.
Ye Xuan was stunned.
Could it be that Zhao Zhiqing was lying to him?
At this moment, not far from Ye Xuan, the space suddenly trembled. Then, a black box floated out of the space.
A box!
Ye Xuan's expression was a little strange. Could this box also contain a little white guy?
Ye Xuan opened the box. Inside the box was a circular black and white seal!
The seal was half black and half white!
Ye Xuan picked up the seal and studied it. He frowned. What was this thing?
Ye Xuan studied it for a long time but still could not figure it out. Hence, he picked up the seal and left the Thirty-fourth Heaven.
Ye Xuan handed the seal to Venerable Mi. "This is?"
When he saw the black and white seal
(This chapter is not finished. Please flip the page)
When the seal appeared, Venerable Mi's expression changed!
Ye Xuan knew that Venerable Mi recognized this black and white seal!
Venerable Mi said solemnly, "This is a Dao seal!"
"Dao seal?"
Ye Xuan was curious. "What is a Dao seal?"
Venerable Mi looked at Ye Xuan with a complicated expression. "A Dao seal!"
Ye Xuan asked again, "What's its use?"
Venerable Mi hesitated and shook his head. "I don't know either!"
Ye Xuan was speechless. After talking for so long, this guy still did not know the use of this Dao seal!
Venerable Mi said again, "Although I don't know the use of this item, it is my Daoting treasure. It has a spirit. Young friend, why don't you communicate with it? Perhaps you will gain something!"
The spirit of the Dao seal!
Ye Xuan nodded. He looked at the Dao seal. "Let's talk?"
No response!
Ye Xuan smiled. Then, he put the Dao seal back into the box. At this moment, an angry voice came from the box. "Let me out!"
Ye Xuan smirked. He opened the box and the Dao seal floated out. At the same time, a little boy floated out from the Dao seal.
The little boy looked about five or six years old. He had a pigtail and looked very cute!
Ye Xuan looked at the little boy. "How should I address you?"
The little boy looked at Ye Xuan and did not speak.
Ye Xuan smiled. "I'm Ye Xuan. What about you?"
The little boy snorted. "I'm not telling you!"
Ye Xuan laughed. "I know even if you don't tell me. You're Little Yin, right?"
The little boy frowned. "How did you know!"
Ye Xuan's expression froze. Damn, this guy is really called Little Yin?
Who gave him that name?
He's as good as me!
Little Yin looked at Ye Xuan. "Why did you call me out?"
Ye Xuan blinked and smiled. "I just wanted to ask. Are you strong?"
Little Yin snorted. "Of course I'm strong!"
Ye Xuan pointed at Venerated Mi. "Can you beat him?"
Venerated Mi: "…"
Little Yin looked at Venerated Mi. He hesitated and shook his head. "I can't beat him!"
Ye Xuan chuckled. "Looks like you're not that strong after all!"
Little Yin immediately said angrily, "Who said that?
Let me tell you. I'm very, very strong! "
Ye Xuan shrugged and did not speak. But his expression said: I don't believe you!
Little Yin suddenly put his palms together. The next moment, he turned into a black light and entered between Ye Xuan's brows.
Boom!
Ye Xuan's body trembled violently. The next moment, a powerful aura swept out from his body. This aura was so strong that Venerated Mi and the others around him were forced to retreat!
In an instant, the Daoting experts around Ye Xuan were sent flying thousands of feet away!
A huge black and white Tai Chi diagram appeared beneath Ye Xuan's feet.
At this moment, Ye Xuan was a little confused!
What the hell was this?
Little Yin suddenly said, "You fight him!"
Ye Xuan looked at Venerated Mi in the distance. He opened his palm and the Executing Heaven Sword appeared. As soon as the Executing Heaven Sword appeared, a Tai Chi diagram appeared above Venerated Mi's head. With the appearance of this Tai Chi diagram, Venerated Mi's realm was suppressed to Dao Defense realm!
From Dao Attainment realm to Dao Defense realm!
Meanwhile, Ye Xuan's aura skyrocketed. Although he did not directly reach Dao Attainment realm, his aura skyrocketed endlessly!
It was infinitely close to the Dao Defense realm!
It wasn't just Ye Xuan who was stunned, everyone else here was as well!
What the hell is this?
Why is it so abnormal?
Meanwhile, Venerated Mi spoke abruptly.
(This chapter isn't finished. Please continue to the next page.)
"I understand!
It's used for support! "
Ye Xuan fell silent.
He understood it now!
The Seal of the Grand Dao was a divine treasure of support!
It could suppress his opponents and strengthen himself!
He didn't have to fear Dao Attainment Realm experts anymore with it in his possession!
Or it should be said that Dao Attainment Realm experts should be afraid of him!
Meanwhile, Little Yin grunted coldly, "I'm amazing, right?"
Ye Xuan smiled, "Amazing!
Extremely amazing! "
Little Yin left Ye Xuan and gazed at Ye Xuan, "Can you let me go?"
Ye Xuan blinked and said, "Can't you leave by yourself?"
Little Yin lowered his head slightly. You have that seal on you.
Ye Xuan understood!
The seal of a god!
This seal was bound by the seal of a god!
He tried to contact the seal of a god, and sure enough, he sensed Little Yin through it.
Xiao Yin continued, "That woman, she used that broken seal to trap me …"
As he spoke, he gazed at Ye Xuan, "Can you let me go?"
Ye Xuan didn't speak. He just opened his palm, and some violet energy appeared in his hand.
Little Yin's eyes lit up when he saw the violet energy, and he blinked, "Can you give it to me?"
Ye Xuan smiled, "Of course!"
As soon as he finished speaking, he pointed with a finger, and the violet energy surged towards Little Yin.
Little Yin instantly revealed an intoxicated expression after absorbing the violet energy, and then he gazed at Ye Xuan, "Do you have more?"
Ye Xuan said with a smile, "No more today!"
Little Yin blinked, "You mean there will be more tomorrow?"
Ye Xuan gave him a thumbs up, "Smart!
How about this, you follow me, and I'll give you 30 strands of this violet energy every day, what do you think? "
Little Yin hesitated, and then said, "Do you want me to follow you and help you fight?"
Ye Xuan nodded, "I want you to follow me, but not to help me fight!
You follow me, and when I'm in trouble, you just need to help me a little, what do you think? "
Little Yin looked at Ye Xuan, "Let me think about it, okay?"
Ye Xuan smiled, "I'll give you 50 strands of violet energy every day!
On top of that, I'll give you 1,000 fortune divine crystals every day! "
As he spoke, he took out a pile of fortune divine crystals and placed them in front of Little Yin.
He knew that the Fortune Divine Crystal was useful to these spiritual beasts.
Little Yin glanced at the fortune divine crystals, and he was very tempted!
Ye Xuan smiled, "I'm a good person, and I don't usually fight!"
Revered Mi, "…"
Little Yin looked at Ye Xuan, and he was still a little hesitant.
Ye Xuan suddenly took out a stick of tanghulu and handed it to Little Yin.
Little Yin was a little curious, "What is this?"
Ye Xuan opened the parchment, and then handed it to Little Yin, "Lick it!"
Little Yin hesitated, and then licked the tanghulu. Soon, his eyes widened in disbelief, "What is this?"
Ye Xuan said with a straight face, "Tanghulu!"
Little Yin licked it again, and he was very excited, or rather a little emotional, because he had never eaten something like this before!
A moment later, Little Yin looked at Ye Xuan, and said excitedly, "I can follow you, but you have to give me a stick of tanghulu every day!"
Ye Xuan, "…"
Seeing that Ye Xuan did not speak, Little Yin hurriedly said, "Half will do!
Half a stick, no less! "
Ye Xuan, "…"
At the side, Revered Mi and the others could not bear to watch anymore …
Ye Xuan, devoid of conscience!
....

I don't want it!!!

Chapter 1412
Just like that, Ye Xuan had succeeded in leaving behind the seal.
And with the existence of this seal, the current Ye Xuan could be said to not be afraid of Dao Realm powerhouses at all!
After subduing the seal, Ye Xuan looked up. There were two more levels after the 34th level.
There were a total of 36 levels!
What would the last two levels contain?
Meanwhile, Venerated Mi seemed to have read Ye Xuan's mind, and he said abruptly, "Daoist Master, the spirit tablets of our Daoting Ancestors are all within the 35 levels, and it's also their resting place. There's nothing else.
As for the 36 levels, there's a super formation within them. It's our Daoting Sect's protective formation, and it'll only be activated when the Daoting Sect is in danger. "
Ye Xuan looked at Venerated Mi, "There aren't any other treasures?"
Venerated Mi laughed bitterly, "There really isn't!"
Ye Xuan nodded slightly, "Then forget it!"
With that, he turned around and left.
Meanwhile, Venerated Mi suddenly said, "Daoist Master, aren't you going to be Daoting?"
Ye Xuan glanced at them and smiled, "How about this? I won't be the Daoting Master, and all of you can make the Daoting Decisions yourselves. What do you think?"
Everyone was stunned when they heard that.
Venerated Mi hurriedly said, "Absolutely not. Since the Ancestor made you the Daoist Master, then you are the Daoist Master. No one can change that!"
Daoting Ancestor? What kind of person was that?
Since she made Ye Xuan the Daoting Master, then there was definitely a deeper meaning behind it.
Moreover, after interacting with Ye Xuan, they realized that Ye Xuan really wasn't simple!
If Ye Xuan didn't become the Daoting Master now, then the Daoting Sect would be without a leader, and its future would be worrying!
Ye Xuan thought for a moment and said, "All of you will listen to what I say, right?"
Venerable Mi quickly nodded. "Of course!"
Ye Xuan looked at Venerable Mi. "I want to rebuild the order of Heaven and Earth, but Daoting all of us have to make changes!"
Venerable Mi hesitated and said, "That's a good thing, but …"
Ye Xuan suddenly asked, "Venerable Mi, do you know why my sister, Lord Qing, is so powerful?"
Venerable Mi looked at Ye Xuan. "Why?"
Ye Xuan walked in front of Venerable Mi and said softly, "Because she has not forgotten her original intention. Venerable Mi, you are also a guardian of the Great Dao, but do you know that your path has gone astray? If I'm not wrong, you have not been in contact with the God's Seal in your body for many years?"
Venerable Mi was silent.
The God's Seal did not leave, but it had been dormant for many years.
However, he did not care about it. With his current strength, he basically did not need to use the God's Seal.
Ye Xuan looked at Venerable Mi. "Senior, do you know why those in the past were able to reach Dao Realization, but you all were stuck at Dao Realization, unable to advance?"
Venerable Mi slowly clenched his fists. "It's a matter of faith!"
Ye Xuan nodded. "When Lord Qing came out, he said something that Senior should remember. That is, 'In the end, things have changed'.
Senior should know the meaning of this, right? "
Venerable Mi was silent.
Of course he knew!
This meant that the Daoting of today was no longer the Daoting of the past!
Ye Xuan looked at Venerable Mi. "Rebuild order, let the Three Thousand Daos shine again, let the world have order again. Senior, if Lord Qing and the others could do it, why can't we?"
He knew that if he wanted to truly control Daoting, he needed the support of Venerable Mi and the other two!
This was because the three of them were Dao Attainment Realm cultivators from the Dao Court!
With their support, anything he wanted to do would be simple.
Venerable Mi was silent for a long time. Then he said, "I understand Dao Master's meaning!
Whatever Dao Master wants to do, do it.
The three of us will support you with all our strength! "
Ye Xuan nodded. "That's good!"
Saying so, he looked around. "Senior, what do you think of the Fifth Dimension?"
Venerable Mi said solemnly, "Very good!"
Ye Xuan smiled. "I want to start with the Fifth Dimension!
To establish a relatively fair order in the Fifth Dimension, what do you think? "
Venerable Mi thought about it. "That's not a problem. However, to re-establish order, I'm afraid it'll be a bit difficult!"
Ye Xuan smiled. "It's not difficult!
As long as we work together, it's not difficult at all. "
Venerable Mi wanted to say something but stopped.
Ye Xuan smiled. "Does Senior want to say that it might affect some people's interests?"
Venerable Mi nodded.
Currently, the Dao Court was fighting for themselves. If they were to establish order now, it would be equivalent to fighting for others. Moreover, they would definitely have to give up some things. Many people would definitely be unwilling to do so.
Ye Xuan looked at Venerable Mi. "If they're not like-minded, then ask them to leave!"
Hearing this, Venerable Mi's heart trembled. He nodded. "Understood!"
Ye Xuan glanced at everyone present, and then he said, "Everyone, head to the Fifth Dimension!"
At the side, White Robe suddenly said. "Heaven Abyss …"
Ye Xuan looked at White Robe. "No!"
White Robe was stunned.
Ye Xuan turned and left. "In the future, I will give you salaries. Everyone's salaries will be doubled."
Everyone was stunned when they heard this.
Double the increase?
Is this true?
Everyone looked at each other.
Just like that, all the Daoting powerhouses headed to the Fifth Dimension. In the Fifth Dimension, Ye Xuan asked Guan Yin to build a Dao City!
This Dao City was filled with Daoting powerhouses.
As for Heaven Abyss, the Daoting completely withdrew and gave Heaven Abyss to the Dao Tomb. This caused the Dao Tomb to be slightly stunned.
What was Ye Xuan doing?
...
After returning to the Fifth Dimension, Ye Xuan immediately called San Sheng, Guan Yin, and Venerable Mi.
Ye Xuan looked at San Sheng. "San Sheng, are you willing to return to the Underworld?"
San Sheng was stunned. Then, he shook his head. "This place is quite fun!"
Ye Xuan smiled. "If you don't want to go back, then forget it!"
Saying this, he looked at Venerable Mi. "Venerable Mi, who do you think should guard the Underworld?"
To rebuild order, the Underworld was crucial.
Venerable Mi thought about it. "To rebuild the Underworld, we need a trustworthy person. Moreover, this person's ability must be outstanding."
Ye Xuan looked at Guan Yin. In fact, Guan Yin's ability was good, but she was not suitable. Her strength was still lacking. Moreover, this side needed Guan Yin. If Guan Yin left, this side would be in chaos.
Venerable Mi suddenly said. "I have a candidate, but I'm afraid you …"
Ye Xuan asked, "Who?"
Venerable Mi said in a deep voice, "Bai Dizi!"
Hearing this, Ye Xuan was stunned.
He had almost forgotten about this old man!
Damn, this old man was definitely capable. However, he did not have a good impression of this old man.
Venerable Mi said, "As the head of the Celestial Lords, Bai Dizi has been helping the previous Dao Ancestor manage the Daoting. If he were to manage the Underworld, it would be a piece of cake for him!"
Ye Xuan thought about it. Then, he said, "Choose someone else."
Venerable Mi was stunned. He looked at Ye Xuan and did not speak.
Ye Xuan smiled. "With his talent, it is a waste of his talent to manage the Underworld!"
Hearing this, Venerable Mi heaved a sigh of relief.
He thought that Ye Xuan wanted to kill Bai Dizi!
Venerable Mi said, "Then let Sir God Yin Ming go to the Underworld!
He was once the liaison between the Daoting and the Underworld, so he is familiar with the Underworld. Moreover, he is strong enough! "
Ye Xuan nodded. "Alright!"
As he spoke, he looked at San Sheng. "San Sheng, the Spirit of the Underworld is following you, right?"
San Sheng's expression changed slightly. She hurriedly shook her head. "No, no!"
Ye Xuan said with a smile, "Really?"
San Sheng said softly, "Can you let her go?"
Ye Xuan smiled. "I won't kill her!
I need her help! "
San Sheng blinked. "What help?"
Ye Xuan said, "Let her return to the Underworld. If there is no Spirit of the Underworld, will it still be called the Underworld?"
San Sheng hesitated for a moment. "I don't know if she will go back!"
Ye Xuan smiled. "She will definitely go back!
Because the Underworld is her home! "
San Sheng nodded. "I'll talk to her!
But if she doesn't want to go back, you can't force her! "
Ye Xuan said with a smile, "Great!"
San Sheng turned and left.
At this moment, Ye Xuan asked again, "Venerable Mi, do you know where Bai Dizi is?"
Venerable Mi nodded. "I do!"
Ye Xuan said, "How about this? Tell him to do something for me!"
Venerable Mi asked, "What is it?"
Ye Xuan said, "Ask him to help find those with the God's Seal. Find them and bring them back. As long as they are willing to return, they will receive a monthly salary."
Venerable Mi smiled. "That won't be a problem. He's in charge of the Daoting. He's the best when it comes to these messy matters."
Ye Xuan nodded. "Go do what you need to do!"
Venerable Mi bowed slightly and turned to leave.
Only Ye Xuan and Guan Yin were left in the hall.
Guan Yin said in a deep voice, "You really want to establish order?"
Ye Xuan nodded.
Guan Yin was puzzled. "Why?"
Ye Xuan said softly, "The current Fifth Dimension is so harmonious because of me. But what if I'm not there?"
Guan Yin was silent.
Without Ye Xuan, the Fifth Dimension would be in chaos!
Because no one could suppress it!
Ye Xuan said softly, "I want to establish order. An order that everyone follows. Even without me, the Fifth Dimension will not be in chaos … At least not for a certain period of time!
Of course, there's nothing wrong with a new order!
At least, this world will become a better place! "
If it was in the past, he would definitely not do this.
But now, he was willing to do it.
Because the Fifth Dimension was the universe that Sister Nian was protecting!
He, Ye Xuan, wanted to protect the Fifth Dimension. Protecting the Fifth Dimension was equivalent to protecting Sister Nian!
He had promised Sister Nian!
....
Ancient God Abyss.
After Su Ke returned to the Ancient God Abyss, at the top of a pyramid, Su Zhe looked at Su Ke. "You're saying that the people from the Dark Abyss want to kill Ye Xuan?"
Su Ke nodded. "Yes.
Young Master Ye not only has the Dao Scripture, but he's also related to Situ Tingyun from the Sword Sect. And the Dark Abyss has a blood feud with Situ Tingyun, so … "
Su Zhe suddenly laughed. "The Dark Abyss … This Old Man is dying from laughter … No, let's take a break … haha …"
Su Ke: "…"
.....







Chapter 1413
In the Fifth Dimension.
In the Sword Hall, Ye Xuan sat cross-legged on the ground.
Stabilizing his realm!
He had reached the Dao Controlling Realm during the battle, but his realm was still unstable. What he needed to do now was to stabilize his realm and familiarize himself with the Dao Controlling Realm!
After reaching the Dao Controlling Realm, he felt that the greatest improvement was in his body.
This was something he had not expected!
He was now at the Dao Controlling Realm and his body was also at the Dao Controlling Realm. It could be said that he could fight Dao Attainment Realm experts without using any external items!
With the addition of that strange Dao seal, he now had the ability to kill a Dao Attainment Realm expert!
In the hall, as Ye Xuan stabilized his realm, his aura became more and more stable. In the end, his aura disappeared and he seemed to have merged with heaven and earth.
...
After the Daoting entered the Fifth Dimension, the Fifth Dimension was unprecedentedly powerful.
In addition, the Spirit Qi in the entire Fifth Dimension was getting denser.
This was because the Fifth Dimension didn't just have the Spirit Qi of Heaven and Earth. There were also the super mineral veins that Ye Xuan brought from the Dark World!
These super mineral veins were not only used to produce fortune crystals but also contained extremely pure Spirit Qi. With these mineral veins, the Spirit Qi in the Fifth Dimension became even denser.
Of course, there was another reason why the Spirit Qi in the Fifth Dimension was so dense. It was because the experts of the Fifth Dimension were protecting it!
In the Fifth Dimension, destroying Spirit Qi and origin was a serious crime!
In short, the Fifth Dimension was better than ever!
...
In the Dao Tomb, the Lord and the others gathered.
The Lord glanced at Luo Hou and the others and said with a smile, "Ye Xuan has taken over the Dao Court completely. He also asked the people of the Dao Court to withdraw from the Celestial Abyss. Now, the Celestial Abyss is in our hands!"
Bitter King said solemnly, "This is a good thing!"
The Lord smiled. "It is indeed a good thing!"
At this moment, Qing Yaoyao suddenly said, "Can Ye Xuan really establish order?"
The Lord looked at Qing Yaoyao and smiled. "What do you think?"
Qing Yaoyao said solemnly, "I think so!"
The Lord asked, "How so?"
Qing Yaoyao said softly, "Because he is strong enough!
And his backer is very strong! "
Backer!
The surroundings suddenly fell silent when they heard this.
Now, not only did Ye Xuan have the support of the people behind him, but he also had the support of the Daoting Ancestors!
Meanwhile, Chi Yaoyao continued, "If he attains the Dao Formation Realm, then I think that very few in the Dao Formation Realm would be a match for him!"
Luo Hou frowned slightly. "He just reached the Dao Defense Realm!"
Qian Yaoyao shook her head. "In this world, some people can't be judged by common sense!"
Luo Hou was silent.
Just as Yan Yaoyao had said, some people couldn't be judged by common sense. For example, Ye Xuan's life was like cheating!
Comparing oneself to others would really anger one to death!
Chi Yaoyao continued, "What we have to think about now is if Ye Xuan really establishes order. At that time, should we obey his order?"
At the side, Bitter King frowned slightly. "He's building his own. What does that have to do with us?"
Yao Yao smiled and didn't say anything.
Luo Hou spoke solemnly, "At that time, I'm afraid it won't be up to us!"
Meanwhile, the Lord suddenly smiled and said, "Actually, establishing a completely new order isn't a bad thing. Of course, it might not be very difficult for him to establish a completely new order. However, he has to deal with two things first!"
Yan Yaoyao spoke solemnly, "The Dark Abyss and the Whirling World!"
The Lord nodded. "The Dark Abyss saved the Dao Ancestors. Obviously, they've chosen to interfere.
As for the Whirling World, I believe that they'll definitely not give up on this scripture.
They would definitely not give up on this scripture. After all, Ye Xuan already had six scrolls with him. If they could get Ye Xuan's six scrolls, they would have seven scrolls in total.
So, if I'm not wrong, the Whirling World has probably sent someone over. "
Luo Hou gazed at the Lord, "What about us?
What should we do now? "
The Lord smiled and said, "Nothing!
We'll just wait and see!
So long as we wait and see, then no matter if it's Ye Xuan, the Whirling World, or the Dark Abyss, none of them will come looking for trouble with us! "
At this point, he smiled faintly, "Of course, we can provide some help to Ye Xuan!"
Luo Hou looked at the Lord, "The Lord is still optimistic about Ye Xuan!"
The Lord smiled, "Why not?
Do you think it's just luck that a person with the Calamity Seed could survive until now? "
Luo Hou was silent.
The Lord smiled, "Don't forget one person!
Mu Niannian! "
Mu Niannian!
The expressions of everyone here changed when they heard this.
They almost forgot about this woman!
This woman had been reborn. Although she had lost her memories and strength, what if she regained her memories?
After all, the Fifth Dimension no longer needed her to suppress it!
Once she regained her memories, she would have all her strength!
In that state, how many people in the world could be a match for Mu Niannian?
Luo Hou said softly, "So, the Dark Abyss and the Whirling World won't give Ye Xuan too much time!"
The Lord suddenly stood up, "This is not something we should worry about. I want to take a stroll in the Fifth Dimension. Are you interested?"
Luo Hou hesitated, "Then let's go!"
The Lord smiled, "Let's go!"
At this point, he left with everyone else.
...
In a certain part of the starry sky, the originally calm starry sky suddenly trembled. It didn't take long for the space there to split open, and then an old man and a woman in a green dress walked out from within.
Both of their faces were slightly pale.
The old man looked around and said softly, "It really wasn't easy to come to this place!"
The woman in green slowly closed her eyes. Her aura was very unstable because traveling through the starry sky had consumed too much of her mind and strength!
After a while, the woman in green returned to normal.
The old man smiled, "How do you feel?"
The woman in green's expression was cold, "Good!"
The old man nodded, looked into the distance, and said softly, "I haven't been to this universe for many years!"
The woman in green said, "Elder, can you feel the aura of Ye Xuan?"
The old man slowly closed his eyes. After a while, he looked to the right, "He is in the Fifth Dimension!"
The woman in green said, "Then let's go!"
The old man shook his head.
The woman in green looked at the old man, and the old man said in a deep voice, "Girl, don't look down on this person. Although we haven't had any dealings with him, he is definitely not an ordinary person since he has five Dao scriptures!"
The woman in green was expressionless, "I am not looking down on him, but I feel that he is not qualified for me to pay attention to him!"
The old man shook his head, "Girl, there is always someone better than you. Be careful in everything you do!"
The woman in green did not speak.
The old man sighed, feeling helpless. The woman in front of him was one of the three great evildoers of the Saha World. She indeed had the qualifications to be arrogant.
However, this Ye Xuan was able to collect five Dao scriptures, so he was definitely not an ordinary person!
The reason he could live until now, besides his own strength, was also because of his cautiousness!
Be careful in everything!
At this time, the woman in green suddenly said, "Elder, let's go meet that Ye Xuan!"
The elder nodded, "Let's go meet him!"
He was also a little curious about this Ye Xuan!
He was actually able to collect two Dao scriptures!
Soon, the two disappeared into the starry sky.
...
In the Fifth Dimension.
The door to Ye Xuan's room was tightly shut.
During this period of time, he had been cultivating in seclusion, and no one came to disturb him.
It was worth mentioning that more and more people in the Fifth Dimension had broken through to the Dao Validation Realm!
Because this time, he had the help of the Daoting!
As one of the top forces, the Daoting could not be compared to the current Fifth Dimension in terms of nurturing people.
This was because the Daoting had inheritance!
In the Fifth Dimension, there was nothing. If it was not for Ye Xuan's wealth, even An Lanxiu and the others could not reach the Dao Validation Realm, let alone others!
And the most evildoer, Xiao Qi, had already begun to break through to the Dao Defense Realm …
As for Xiao Qi's talent, even experts like the Daoting were very shocked!
It was too terrifying!
It could be said that Xiao Qi's talent was not inferior to Ye Xuan's at all!
In a hall somewhere, Venerable Mi, who was resting with his eyes closed, suddenly opened his eyes. The next moment, he disappeared on the spot, and when he reappeared, he was already in the starry sky.
In front of him stood an old man and a woman in green!
Seeing Venerable Mi, the old man smiled, "You are?"
Venerable Mi asked, "The two of you are?"
The old man smiled, "The two of us are from the Whirling World. This time, we came to meet Young Master Ye!"
The Whirling World!
Venerable Mi's heart sank. He knew that this force would appear sooner or later, but he did not expect it to appear so soon!
The old man smiled, "Is that okay?"
Venerable Mi glanced at the two of them, and then said, "I'll go ask the Dao Master!"
With that, he turned and left.
At this moment, the old man suddenly said, "Dao Master?"
Venerable Mi glanced at the old man, "He is now the Dao Master of my Daoting!"
With that, he turned and disappeared in the starry sky.
The Dao Master!
The old man frowned slightly, "Ye Xuan has actually become the Master of the Daoting …. Didn't the information we gathered say that Ye Xuan and the Daoting are mortal enemies?"
The woman in green looked down and remained silent. No one knew what she was thinking.
Meanwhile, Venerable Mi appeared once more in the starry sky, and he glanced at the two of them, "The Dao Master invites you in!"
As soon as he finished speaking, he gestured for them to enter.
The old man nodded slightly, "Please lead the way!"
Venerable Mi nodded, and then he turned around and left.
The two of them followed Venerable Mi.
Under Venerable Mi's lead, the two of them arrived at Sword Hall, and only Ye Xuan was there.
Looking at the two old men, Ye Xuan said with a smile, "Please take a seat."
The old man smiled, "Young Master Ye, I've heard a lot about you!"
Ye Xuan grinned, "You must be joking!"
The old man continued, "Old Man, let's get straight to the point!
I heard that Young Master Ye has five Daoist scriptures! "
Ye Xuan nodded, "Yes!"
The old man smiled, "Young Master Ye, those Daoist scriptures belong to my Whirling Sect. I wonder if Young Master Ye can return them?"
They belong to the Whirling Sect!
Ye Xuan blinked, "Are you sure?"
The old man said seriously, "They do indeed belong to my Whirling Sect!
Young Master Ye, please return them! "
Ye Xuan sighed softly, "You're too late!"
The old man frowned, "What do you mean?"
Ye Xuan said seriously, "The five Daoist scriptures have been taken by the Dark World!"
Venerable Mi, "…"
..







Chapter 1414
The Dark World has taken it!
In the hall, the old man frowned at Ye Xuan's words. "Really?"
Ye Xuan nodded, "Really.
If you check, you'll find out that the former Dao Ancestor has joined forces with the Dark World.
They have many Dao Scriptures now. If you want them, you can go to the Dark World! "
The old man fell silent.
The woman spoke abruptly, "I heard you're the number one genius in this universe?"
Ye Xuan looked at her and smiled, "You must be joking!"
The woman looked at Ye Xuan, "Shall we spar?"
Ye Xuan hurriedly shook his head, "No, no!"
The woman frowned, "Why?"
Ye Xuan laughed bitterly, "How can a place like this compare to the Whirling World?
The number one genius here is probably a joke in the eyes of the Whirling World! "
He paused for a moment and continued, "Moreover, your aura is thick. I'm afraid you've attained the Dao Realm, right?"
The woman glanced at Ye Xuan and nodded slightly.
Ye Xuan's expression instantly turned solemn, and he cupped his fists, "It's truly rare to see someone who has attained the Dao Realm at such a young age."
The woman's expression was calm, "Even though there aren't many young Dao Realm cultivators in the Whirling World, there are quite a few!"
Ye Xuan hesitated for a moment and said, "May I know when you attained the Dao?"
The woman looked at Ye Xuan, "I attained the Dao Imperial Realm at the age of 16, attained the Dao at the age of 18, and I'm 20 now!"
Ye Xuan was stunned, and then he said with astonishment, "Attained the Dao at the age of 18?"
The woman nodded, "Yes!
Why do you look so shocked? "
Ye Xuan laughed bitterly, "Miss, I didn't even attain the Dao at the age of 18.
There's always someone better out there! "
The woman glanced at Ye Xuan, "Don't be discouraged, you're not bad yourself!"
Ye Xuan shook his head repeatedly. "In this universe, I might be considered good, but if I were to be placed in your world, I'm afraid I'm nothing!
Sigh … "
The green-robed woman's lips moved, but she didn't know what to say.
She was really not good at comforting people!
At the side, the old man glanced at Ye Xuan. No one knew what he was thinking.
Venerable Mi also glanced at Ye Xuan with an odd expression.
At this time, Ye Xuan looked at the green-robed woman, "May I know your name?"
The woman hesitated for a moment before she said, "Xuan Chu!"
Ye Xuan cupped his fists and said, "Miss Xuan Chu, if you don't mind, I would like to ask you some questions about the Martial Dao!"
Xuan Chu looked at the old man. The old man smiled and said, "Young master Ye, since the Dao Scripture is not in your hands, then we will have to leave!
If there's a chance in the future, the two of you can discuss it! "
Ye Xuan sighed softly with a downcast expression.
Xuan Chu glanced at Ye Xuan and was about to speak when the old man suddenly said, "Young master Ye, we will be leaving now!"
With that, he turned around and left with Xuan Chu.
At this moment, Ye Xuan hurriedly said, "Miss, please wait!"
Xuan Chu looked at Ye Xuan. Ye Xuan walked quickly to Xuan Chu, and he hesitated for a moment before he said, "Miss Xuan Chu, will you be coming back?"
Xuan Chu, "…"
Venerable Mi, "…"
At the side, the old man glanced at Ye Xuan with a slightly unsightly expression.
Dammit, this kid has ulterior motives!
Xuan Chu was about to speak when the old man suddenly said, "Young master Ye, we won't be coming back!"
His tone was very flat and carried a trace of coldness.
Ye Xuan was stunned, and then he looked at Xuan Chu. He was about to speak when the old man suddenly said, "Young master Ye, we have matters to attend to. Farewell!"
With that, he left with Xuan Chu.
Ye Xuan still wanted to say something, but the old man disappeared with Xuan Chu.
Ye Xuan was stunned, and a moment later, he turned to look at Venerable Mi. "Am I very scary?"
Venerable Mi hesitated. "A little!"
At this moment, he was quite emotional. No wonder Bai Dizi couldn't defeat this fellow!
This fellow was really shameless!
In fact, he was quite impressed with Ye Xuan because Ye Xuan had resolved this crisis with just a few words!
At least it was temporarily resolved!
At this moment, Ye Xuan suddenly left the hall.
Outside the hall, Nian Nian appeared beside Ye Xuan. Nian Nian turned to look at Ye Xuan and giggled. "Where are we going to play today?"
Ye Xuan laughed. "You decide!"
Nian Nian blinked. "Roast fish first!"
Hearing that, Ye Xuan instantly burst into laughter.
Roast fish!
In next to no time, Ye Xuan took Nian Nian's hand and vanished into the distance.
...
Xuan Chu and the old man looked down from the starry sky, and no one knew what they were thinking.
The old man suddenly said, "Xuan Chu, do you believe that scripture is in the hands of the Dark World?"
Xuan Chu spoke softly, "It should be true!"
The old man was quite puzzled. "Why?"
Xuan Chu looked down and said, "He doesn't seem like someone who would lie!"
The old man was speechless.
Xuan Chu continued, "Should we go to the Dark World?"
The old man shook his head. "The Dark World isn't like the Fifth Dimension. It isn't that simple."
Xuan Chu gazed at the old man. "Wait?"
The old man thought for a moment and said, "Wait for me to investigate and understand the ins and outs of the matter!"
Xuan Chu nodded. "Alright!"
The old man glanced at Xuan Chu, hesitated for a moment, and said, "Little Girl, what do you think of Ye Xuan?"
Xuan Chu gazed at the old man. "Elder, why do you ask?"
The old man replied, "I'm just asking!"
Xuan Chu fell silent for a moment before he said, "He's a good person!"
The old man's face fell. "Little Girl, in my opinion, Ye Xuan might not be a good person. Moreover, he's quite flashy, so you have to be careful!"
Xuan Chu's expression was calm. "Elder, what are you trying to say?"
The old man hesitated for a moment before he said, "Little Girl, you're the most monstrous genius of my Whirling Sect, and you're the next Sect Master …. Of course, this doesn't mean that you have to be heartless. However, the person you choose must be a genius favored by the heavens. But this Ye Xuan …."
As he spoke, he shook his head. "Even though this Ye Xuan isn't particularly bad, he isn't worthy of you!"
Xuan Chu gazed at the old man. "Elder, aren't you overthinking things?"
The old man sighed in a low voice. "I'm not overthinking things. It's just that this Ye Xuan is clearly a playboy … No matter what, Xuan Chu should avoid interacting with him!"
Xuan Chu gazed down with a calm expression. "Elder, someone who was able to become a Daolord and manage the Fifth Dimension so well can't be too bad!"
As she spoke, she gazed at the old man. "Elder, don't judge a person from a one-sided perspective."
The old man laughed bitterly. "Little Girl, I'm not looking down on him. It's just that he's flashy, and he's … intentionally trying to curry favor with you. I think …."
Xuan Chu shook her head. "Elder, in your opinion, he's trying to curry favor with me. But in my opinion, he's a humble and low-profile person."
The old man was speechless.
Xuan Chu continued. "Elder, don't forget that he's a Swordsman!"
A Swordsman!
The old man fell silent.
Needless to say, this Swordsman wasn't quite like the Swordsman he'd imagined!
Right at this moment, a figure suddenly appeared in front of the old man and Xuan Chu.
It was Dark World's Lian Zun!
Lian Zun cupped his fists and smiled. "You two should be from the Whirling World, right?"
The old man looked at Lian Zun. "Dark World?"
Lian Zun smiled. "Yes!"
The old man was expressionless. "What's the matter?"
Lian Zun nodded. "Your Excellency, why don't we cooperate?"
The old man frowned. "Cooperate?"
Lian Zun smiled. "That Ye Xuan isn't simple. Not only does he have a mysterious expert behind him, but he also has a relationship with the Ancient God Abyss. Most importantly …"
The old man suddenly interrupted Lian Zun. "Isn't the Dao Scripture in your Dark World's hands?"
Lian Zun was stunned. "Who said that?"
The old man said. "Ye Xuan!"
Ye Xuan!
Lian Zun: "…"
The old man continued. "Why, isn't it in your Daoting hands?"
Lian Zun said in a deep voice. "To tell you the truth, my Dark World has two Dao Scriptures, and that Ye Xuan has six!"
The old man frowned. "He said you took them all!"
Lian Zun shook his head. "He's bullsh * tting!"
The old man's face darkened.
Ye Xuan was lying?
Xuan Chu suddenly said. "You're saying he has six Dao Scriptures?"
Lian Zun nodded. "Yes!"
Xuan Chu looked at Lian Zun. "Why didn't you take them?"
The old man looked at Xuan Chu. "Girl, this isn't the point. The point is that Ye Xuan is lying to us!"
Xuan Chu looked at the old man. "Why isn't Dark World lying to us?"
Old man: "…"
Lian Zun suddenly smiled. "Looks like you don't know much about this Ye Xuan. He's a famous liar. If you get to know him better, you'll know who's real and who's fake!"
Xuan Chu looked at Lian Zun. "If he has six Dao Scriptures, why didn't Dark World take them?"
Lian Zun smiled. "I told you!
This Ye Xuan isn't simple! "
Xuan Chu asked again. "You want to join forces with us to fight for the Dao Scriptures?"
Lian Zun nodded. "Yes!"
Xuan Chu asked. "What happens after we get the Dao Scriptures?"
Lian Zun smiled. "Why don't we talk about this after we get the Dao Scriptures?"
Xuan Chu didn't speak anymore. He looked at the old man.
The old man said after a moment of silence, "Sir, I don't know who is telling the truth between you and Ye Xuan. We'll look into it. As for the cooperation, let's not talk about it for now!"
With that, he left with Xuan Chu.
In the starry sky, Lian Zun was silent for a moment. He said softly, "Ye Xuan, can you be more shameless?
When did Dark World snatch your Dao Scriptures? "
....
Ancient God Abyss.
At the top of a pyramid, Su Zhe suddenly said, "Dark World might be up to something big recently!"
Beside Su Zhe, Su Ke asked in a low voice, "What do you mean?"
Su Zhe turned around and said, "Many powerful auras are coming out from Dark Abyss!"
Hearing this, Su Ke's face darkened. "Should we stop them?"
Su Zhe shook his head. "What for?"
Su Ke was puzzled. "Don't stop them?"
Su Zhe slowly closed his eyes. "Don't stop them!
Let them continue, the more they do, the better … "
Su Ke was speechless.
....
PS: Many readers have been saying that I'm a liar!
I just want to say that you've underestimated me!
What's a mere monthly ticket?
I don't want it!







Chapter 1415
Suke said solemnly, "You want to use the plain-dressed woman to destroy the Dark Abyss?"
Hearing this, Su Zhe opened his eyes. After a long moment of silence, he said softly, "We've been at a stalemate with the Dark Abyss for hundreds of thousands of years!
How many people have we lost in these hundreds of thousands of years? "
Su Ke was silent.
Su Zhe continued, "For the past hundreds of thousands of years, neither of us has been able to defeat the other. But now, it's time to end this long war!"
Suke asked solemnly, "Can that senior really destroy the Dark Abyss?"
Su Zhe looked up into the starry sky. "Forget about destroying the Dark Abyss, even if the Ancient God Abyss and the Dark Abyss were to join forces, we would still be no match for her!"
Su Ke's expression was grave. "Is he really that strong?"
Su Zhe's eyes were clouded with confusion, "You've never faced her before, you don't know how we feel when we face her!
This is despair, true despair! "
The strength of the plainly dressed woman caused him to feel despair!
At this time, Su Zhe suddenly laughed, "I never imagined that An Yuan would want to kill Ye Xuan. It seems like the heavens want An Yuan dead!"
Saying that, he looked at Su Ke. "You can contact that Young Master Ye and give him some help."
Su Ke nodded. "Understood!"
As if he'd thought of something, Su Ke said, "According to my knowledge, Lian Zun is investigating that woman in a plain dress!"
Su Zhe laughed, "Let him investigate!
They won't be able to find anything anyway! "
Currently, only the people from the Ancient God Abyss knew how strong the lady in the plain dress was. However, would the Ancient God Abyss tell An Yuan about it?
Of course not!
Suke continued, "And the Whirling World …"
Hearing this, Su Zhe fell silent.
Even the Ancient God Abyss had to take the Whirling World seriously!
After a while, Su Zhe said, "If Young Master Ye is in danger, protect him at all costs!"
Su Ke looked at Su Zhe, "At all costs?"
Su Zhe nodded. "At all costs!"
Su Ke was silent.
Su Zhe said, "This friend of Young Master Ye, my Ancient God Abyss is definitely going to befriend him!"
Su Ke: "…"
...
Somewhere in the starry sky, Lian Zun sat cross-legged in the starry sky. His entire being seemed to be one with the starry sky.
Next to him was a former Daofather.
At that moment, the Dao Ancestor had already recovered his body.
At this time, Lian Zun opened his eyes. He looked down at the Fifth Dimension and smiled. "Dao Ancestor, how do you feel now?"
The Dao Ancestor was expressionless and did not say anything.
Now that the Daoting had settled in the Fifth Dimension, how could he feel?
With the support of the Daoting Ancestor, no one in the Daoting World would recognize him as the Dao Ancestor anymore!
Lian Zun suddenly said, "Dao Ancestor, Daoting, you've investigated Ye Xuan before this. Do you know who that woman in a plain dress behind him is?"
The Dao Ancestor shook his head. "I don't know!"
Lian Zun frowned, "You don't know?"
The Dao Ancestor nodded. "This person is too mysterious. I only know that she usually only uses one sword to kill!"
One strike!
Lian Zun chuckled, "Interesting!"
The Dao Ancestor shook his head. "This woman's strength is most likely above Dao Attainment!"
Lian Zun said softly, "Above Dao Attainment … Can you be sure?"
The Dao Ancestor shook his head. "I'm not sure because I've never come into contact with this person before!"
After a moment of silence, Lian Zun said, "How do we find this person?"
The Dao Ancestor looked at Lian Zun. "You want to find her!"
Lian Zun stood up and looked down. "This person is Ye Xuan's Dao Protector. Naturally, I have to figure out her background and true strength. Otherwise, she will be like a thorn in my throat!"
Saying this, he looked at the Dao Ancestor. "How about it? Are you interested in meeting this person?"
The Dao Ancestor frowned. "Me?"
Lian Zun smiled. "Yes."
The Dao Ancestor was silent.
Lian Zun smiled. "With your strength, even if you can't defeat the opponent, it shouldn't be a problem for you to escape unscathed!
Of course, if you're afraid, it doesn't matter. I'll send someone else! "
The Dao Ancestor said calmly, "There's no need for someone else. I'll go myself!
I also want to see how strong this person is.
However, I don't know where this person is! "
Lian Zun said, "Didn't someone find her before you Daoting?"
The Dao Ancestor said in a deep voice, "That's because of their talent!
Now, both of them are dead! "
Lian Zun thought about it and said, "That's simple!"
As soon as he finished speaking, an old man suddenly appeared behind him.
The old man's attire was a little gaudy. His body was covered in copper coins. In his left hand, he held a long wooden staff and in his right hand, he held a tortoise shell.
Lian Zun smiled and said, "Master, thank you!"
The old man nodded slightly and slowly closed his eyes. Soon, the copper coins on his body began to tremble violently.
Seeing that, the Dao Ancestor frowned. "Is this a divination technique?"
Lian Zun smiled and said, "Yes!
However, it's not an ordinary divination technique. It's a divination technique from the Dark Sutra. "
Just as the Dao Ancestor was about to speak, the old man suddenly opened his eyes. He looked into the depths of the starry sky and frowned.
Lian Zun asked, "What's wrong?"
The former master said hoarsely, "It's in a very, very far place!"
The Dao Ancestor frowned slightly. "How far?"
The former master said in a low voice, "Extremely far!"
The Dao Ancestor looked at Lian Zun. Lian Zun said softly, "Very far … Isn't he Ye Xuan's Dao Protector?
Why is he so far away?
Or does the other party have a motive? "
The Dao Ancestor said in a low voice, "He might have a motive!"
As he spoke, he looked at the former master. "Can you catch up to this person?"
After a moment of silence, the former master said, "I can try!"
As he spoke, he opened his palm and a black copper coin appeared in his palm. He handed the copper coin to the Dao Ancestor. "This item will guide you!"
The Dao Ancestor nodded and took the copper coin. At that moment, Lian Zun suddenly said, "Dao Ancestor, the main purpose of finding this woman this time is to test her. If you can't defeat her, don't become enemies with her. Protecting yourself is the most important!"
The Dao Ancestor put away the copper coin and said calmly, "Don't worry. As long as I see this person, I'll know his strength!"
As he spoke, he paused for a moment and continued, "Even if I'm not her match, if I want to escape, she can't do anything to me. I still have that much confidence."
Lian Zun nodded. "No matter what, it's better to be careful!"
The Dao Ancestor nodded and did not say anything else. He turned around and left. Soon, he disappeared into the vast starry sky.
After the Dao Ancestor left, Lian Zun suddenly looked at the former master. "Is this trip ominous or auspicious?"
The former master was silent.
Lian Zun frowned slightly. "I don't know or can't say?"
The former master shook his head. "I don't know!"
As he spoke, he sighed softly. "I'm afraid this woman isn't that simple!"
Lian Zun asked. "What do you mean?"
The former master shook his head slightly. "When I was calculating this person, I always had a feeling of unease in my heart. I've never seen such a scene before!"
As he spoke, he raised his head and looked into the depths of the starry sky. There was a trace of worry in his eyes. "I'm afraid he'll be in trouble this time!"
He was in trouble!
Lian Zun raised his head and looked into the depths of the starry sky. He smiled and said, "I'm a little curious about how strong she is."
As he spoke, he seemed to have thought of something and shook his head with a smile. "Killing with only one sword … It sounds very powerful …"
With that, he turned around and left.
...
In the Five-Dimensional Universe.
In the Dao City, Ye Xuan was strolling leisurely on the streets with Nian Nian. In her left hand, she was holding a roasted fish and in her right hand, she was holding a stick of candied hawthorn!
Along the way, Nian Nian kept looking around curiously.
Ye Xuan looked at Nian Nian beside him and smiled. Actually, he didn't miss Nian to recover her memory so quickly because Nian Nian didn't have so many burdens now. She was very happy!
Of course, it would be a good thing if she could recover her memory!
At this moment, Nian Nian suddenly pulled Ye Xuan's hand and pointed to the noodle shop not far away.
Ye Xuan laughed. "Let's go!
Let's eat some noodles! "
Nian Nian quickly nodded.
After the two of them found a place to sit down, Ye Xuan looked at the boss in the distance and said with a smile, "Two bowls of noodles!"
In the distance, the boss smiled and said, "Alright!"
Soon, the waiter placed two bowls of noodles in front of the two of them.
Ye Xuan looked at the two bowls of noodles in front of him in silence.
At this moment, he thought of Ye Ling!
Ling 'er!
Where was she now?
At this moment, Nian Nian suddenly said, "What's wrong?"
Ye Xuan retracted his thoughts and said with a smile, "Nothing!
Let's eat some noodles! "
Nian Nian was about to speak when a woman suddenly walked to the side of the two of them.
It was Xuan Chu!
Xuan Chu directly sat next to Ye Xuan. Ye Xuan was stunned for a moment and then said with a smile, "Miss Xuan Chu!
We meet again! "
Xuan Chu looked at Ye Xuan. "The Dao Scripture is in your hands, right?"
Ye Xuan said with a smile, "It seems that Miss Xuan Chu has already come into contact with the Dark World!"
Xuan Chu was expressionless. "Why did you lie?"
Ye Xuan was silent.
Xuan Chu looked at Ye Xuan and asked again, "Why did you lie to me!?"
Ye Xuan smiled bitterly. "Miss Xuan Chu, if you were me, what would you do?"
Xuan Chu's expression was cold and she did not speak.
Ye Xuan said again, "You are so strong. If I did not use this method, would you and your elder let me go?
Definitely not! "
Xuan Chu said, "That Dao Scripture belongs to the Whirling Sect …"
Ye Xuan's lips curled up. "Are you sure?"
Xuan Chu frowned. "What do you mean?"
Ye Xuan said with a smile, "As far as I know, this Dao Scripture came from the Whirling World. However, it does not belong to the Whirling Sect, right?"
Xuan Chu shook her head. "You should know that it will only bring you endless trouble if you have it."
Ye Xuan suddenly said, "Did you cooperate with the Dark World?"
Xuan Chu shook her head. "No!
However, the elder is very likely to cooperate with them. "
Ye Xuan suddenly said, "Xuan Chu, why don't we cooperate?"
Xuan Chu looked at Ye Xuan. "We cooperate?"
Ye Xuan nodded. "We cooperate and deal with the Dark World together!"
Xuan Chu looked at Ye Xuan. "The elder will not cooperate with you!"
Ye Xuan was confused. "Why?"
Xuan Chu said, "Because you are weaker than the Dark World!"
Ye Xuan: "…"
Xuan Chu said again, "Moreover, you have more Dao Scriptures than the Dark World!"
Then, she paused and said, "Can I have a look at those Dao Scriptures?"
Ye Xuan said with a smile, "Of course you can!"
After saying that, he waved his right hand and six Dao Scriptures appeared in front of Xuan Chu.
Xuan Chu was stunned. She just let him see it?
Xuan Chu looked at Ye Xuan. "Why do you trust me so much?"
Ye Xuan said with a smile, "I treat you as a friend!
Moreover, as the super monster of the Whirling World, you will not do such a despicable thing, right?
Of course, if you snatch it, then I, Ye Xuan, am blind. I will admit defeat! "
Xuan Chu was silent.

Chapter 1416
Xuan Chu looked at Ye Xuan. "Are you trying to play tricks with me?"
Ye Xuan smiled. "Miss Xuan Chu, are the Dao scriptures in front of you fake?"
Xuan Chu looked at the six Dao scriptures. After a while, she said softly, "They are real!"
Ye Xuan asked, "Then can you show me the Dao scriptures from the Whirling World?
Even if you're playing tricks! "
After a moment of silence, Xuan Chu lowered her head and said softly, "I'm sorry, I can't show them to you!"
Ye Xuan smiled. "It doesn't matter!
You can look at mine first! "
Xuan Chu hesitated and shook her head. She placed the six Dao scriptures back in front of Ye Xuan. "I'm not looking at them!"
With that, she stood up and left.
At this moment, Ye Xuan suddenly said, "Why aren't you looking at them?"
Xuan Chu stopped and looked at Ye Xuan. "The Whirling World's Dao scriptures are the sect's most precious treasures. Without the sect leader's permission, I can't show them to others!"
Ye Xuan smiled. "Because you can't show them to me, you won't look at mine?"
Xuan Chu nodded.
Ye Xuan thought for a moment and said, "Aren't you curious about these Dao scriptures?"
Xuan Chu's expression was calm. "I'm curious, but I don't want to owe you anything!"
Ye Xuan smiled. "How about this? I'll show you these Dao scriptures, and then I'll ask you some questions.
Xuan Chu fell silent.
Ye Xuan smiled. "Don't worry, it won't be anything difficult for you!"
Xuan Chu nodded. "Sure!"
With that, she sat opposite Ye Xuan.
As if noticing something, she suddenly looked at Nian Nian. Nian Nian was holding a bowl and drinking soup. When she saw Xuan Chu looking at her, she hurriedly put down the bowl and grinned.
Xuan Chu hesitated for a moment and nodded slightly.
She knew Nian Nian's identity because she had investigated Ye Xuan and the Five-Dimensional Universe before coming here.
Nian Nian giggled. "Sister, do you want to eat noodles too?"
Xuan Chu shook her head. "No, you eat!"
Nian Nian nodded and continued eating her noodles.
Ye Xuan looked at Nian Nian and shook his head with a smile.
He realized that Nian Nian was a foodie!
Now, not only did she like to eat fish, but she also liked to eat tanghulu and all kinds of delicious food …
Xuan Chu picked up the Dao Scripture in front of Ye Xuan and read it. After some time, she looked at Ye Xuan. "Do you know the secret of the Dao Scripture?"
Ye Xuan felt a chill in his heart. Could it be that she knew about Dao scriptures and martial arts?
At this moment, Xuan Chu wanted to say something but hesitated.
Ye Xuan asked softly, "What are you trying to say?"
Xuan Chu thought for a moment and said, "Fine, I'll take it as returning the favor.
Every Dao scripture contained a Dao scripture martial art and Dao scripture mental cultivation method!
These martial arts and mental cultivation methods are currently the highest level of martial arts and mental cultivation methods known to us! "
Mental cultivation method!
Ye Xuan's expression turned cold.
He knew about Dao scriptures and martial arts, but he didn't know about this mental cultivation method.
At this moment, Ye Zhiming's voice suddenly sounded. "I don't know either!"
Ye Xuan nodded and said in his heart, "Of course I believe you, Zhiming!
It seems that this Dao scripture is not as simple as we thought! "
Xuan Chu placed the Dao scripture in front of Ye Xuan. "I've memorized the mental cultivation method and martial arts of these Dao scriptures …"
Then, she paused and said, "Two of the martial arts are very suitable for you. One is the Taoist fist and the Taoist body."
Ye Xuan was silent.
Xuan Chu looked at Ye Xuan. "You're very calm …"
Speaking of this, she narrowed her eyes slightly. "You've learned it!"
Ye Xuan nodded. "To tell you the truth, I've learned it."
Xuan Chu was silent.
Ye Xuan smiled. "Xuan Chu, you said that every Dao scripture has a mental cultivation method … I only know about Dao scriptures and martial arts, but I don't know about the mental cultivation method. Can you tell me?"
Xuan Chu was silent.
Ye Xuan was speechless. This guy, he was always silent.
Xuan Chu suddenly said, "Sure!"
Then, she pointed at Ye Xuan. A ray of white light entered between Ye Xuan's eyebrows. Soon, countless information flowed into Ye Xuan's mind.
The mental cultivation method of every Dao scripture!
Gradually, Ye Xuan's expression changed!
After learning about these mental cultivation methods, Ye Xuan realized that he was wrong!
Very wrong!
These Dao scriptures and martial arts were very powerful. However, without the help of mental cultivation methods, their power was only average. But with the help of mental cultivation methods, their power could truly destroy the world!
Just like his Taoist fist, if it had the help of mental cultivation methods, its power could at least be several times stronger!
At this moment, he realized how terrifying these Dao scriptures and mental cultivation methods were!
The mental cultivation method was the key!
And his Taoist body also had mental cultivation methods. If it was combined with mental cultivation methods …
At this moment, Ye Xuan was very excited!
Xuan Chu suddenly said, "Are you willing to give up these six Dao scriptures?"
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "Why do you ask this?"
Xuan Chu looked at Ye Xuan and said, "If you are willing to give up these six Dao scriptures, I can bring you to the Whirling Sect. With your talent, you will definitely be valued.
The stage there is bigger, and the cultivation resources here cannot be compared.
In addition, if you are willing to join the Whirling Sect, you can look at the last Dao scripture. "
Ye Xuan shook his head.
Xuan Chu said, "You refuse?"
Ye Xuan nodded and said with a smile, "Miss Xuan Chu, I want to protect this Fifth Dimension!"
Xuan Chu looked at Ye Xuan and said, "On the path of martial arts, there are too many obstacles. It is not a good thing!"
Ye Xuan suddenly asked, "Xuan Chu, do you have any friends?"
Xuan Chu was stunned and then shook her head. "No!"
Ye Xuan asked again, "What about your relatives?"
Xuan Chu said, "Only Master."
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "I feel that there are more important things in this world than the Martial Dao and the Sword Dao. That is friends and relatives!"
As he said this, he looked around and said with a smile, "This is the Fifth Dimension. This is my home."
Xuan Chu looked at Ye Xuan and said, "If you do not give up on these Dao scriptures, not only you, but the entire universe will be in danger!
This is because my Whirling Sect is not the only Whirling Sect in the Whirling World. There are other powerful forces.
If I am not wrong, these forces should already know that you have so many Dao scriptures. Before long, more and more experts from the Whirling World will come to this universe.
Moreover, you still have the Dark World as your enemy. Your situation will become worse and worse! "
Ye Xuan shook his head and smiled. "My situation has always been very bad!"
Xuan Chu was about to speak when Ye Xuan suddenly looked at Nian Nian and said with a smile, "Are you done eating?"
Nian Nian nodded and patted her stomach. She grinned and said, "I am so full!"
Ye Xuan laughed and said, "Let's go, I will take you to play!"
As he said this, he stretched out his hand. Nian Nian quickly grabbed his hand.
Ye Xuan looked at Xuan Chu and said with a smile, "Miss Xuan Chu, let's talk another day!"
Xuan Chu nodded slightly.
Ye Xuan pulled Nian Nian away.
After Ye Xuan and Nian Nian left, an old man appeared in front of Xuan Chu.
It was the old man from the Whirling World.
The old man said, "He is not willing to give up?"
Xuan Chu nodded.
The old man shook his head, "Those Dao scriptures are a disaster for him. This youth does not know how to choose!"
Xuan Chu said softly, "We have underestimated him!"
The old man looked at Xuan Chu, "What do you mean?"
Xuan Chu looked at the old man, "Elder, why does the Dark World want to ally with us?"
The old man frowned, "You are saying that the Dark World is afraid of Ye Xuan!"
Xuan Chu nodded, "The Dark World wants to ally with us because they want to use us!"
The old man said in a deep voice, "Indeed!"
Xuan Chu suddenly said, "Let's wait and see!"
The old man said in a deep voice, "Wait?"
Xuan Chu nodded, "We can only wait!
All he had to do was wait quietly!
We do not have any deep hatred with Ye Xuan. If we are not anxious, the other forces from the Whirling World and Dark World will be even more anxious. They will make the first move! "
The old man nodded slightly, "Alright!"
Speaking of this, he seemed to have thought of something and said, "Girl, Ye Xuan is a person with deep schemes. He showed you the Dao scriptures just now, that is definitely a trap!
You must not have any other thoughts! "
Xuan Chu looked at the old man, "What other thoughts?"
The old man smiled, "You know what I mean!"
Xuan Chu said softly, "What I see is a person who values friendship and righteousness!"
With that, he stood up and left.
In the same place, the old man's expression was extremely ugly. A moment later, he slammed his palm on the table. "Damn Ye Xuan!
Shameless! "
Boom!
The table shattered.
...
After returning to the Sword Hall, Ye Xuan was about to study the Dao scripture when Venerable Mi appeared beside him.
Ye Xuan looked at Venerable Mi, "What's the matter?"
Venerable Mi nodded, "Bai Dizi is back!"
Ye Xuan was struck dumb. Then he said, "You are back?"
Venerable Mi nodded, "Not alone!
He brought over 30 Great Dao Guardians!
Among them, there are 16 Dao Defense and 14 Dao Vindication.
Other than that, some who left the Daoting have all returned. "
Ye Xuan said softly, "This old man is quite capable!"
Venerable Mi added, "He has a suggestion."
Ye Xuan said, "Speak!"
Venerable Mi said, "Bai Dizi said that our biggest enemies now are the Dark Abyss and the Whirling World. The Dark Abyss is scarier than the Whirling World because they are united. The Whirling World is different. There are many forces there, each with their own ideas. We can form an alliance with some of the forces there.
In short, we have to delay until Miss Nian Nian recovers her memory and strength! "
Delay!
Ye Xuan was silent.
He really needed time now!
The more time, the better it was for him and the Fifth Dimension.
Venerable Mi said, "He also said that the Fifth Dimension looks safe now, but it is not. Because if the Dark Abyss wants to attack, it will not give the Fifth Dimension any chance.
For now, the Daoting and the Fifth Dimension together might not be able to defeat the Dark Abyss. "
Saying this, he looked at Ye Xuan, "He said that although the Dao Master is strong, he is only one person. Moreover, he has not reached the Dao Attainment State. Once the Dark Abyss or the Whirling World send experts above the Dao Attainment State, the Fifth Dimension will be very passive.
Therefore, we must delay until Miss Nian Nian recovers her memory and strength.
Moreover, he also told you to prepare for the worst. The Dark Abyss will most likely attack soon because the Dark Abyss does not dare to let Miss Nian Nian recover her memory and strength! "
After a moment of silence, Ye Xuan said softly, "I understand!"
At this time, Venerable Mi said, "Also, he made a decision on his own!"
Ye Xuan was a little puzzled, "What is it?"
Venerable Mi hesitated for a moment, then said: "He has already sent people to spread the news in the Fifth Dimension and the myriad worlds, saying that you are the son of the Ninth Dimension, and that you came to the Fifth Dimension to gain experience …"
Ye Xuan, "…"
...







Chapter 1417
Son of the Ninth Dimension!
Ye Xuan was speechless.
What was this old man Bai Dizi trying to do?
Venerable Mi said, "He's probably doing this to confuse our opponents!"
Ye Xuan smiled, "Let him be!"
He looked at Venerable Mi, "The Fifth Dimension might not be peaceful during this period of time. You have to keep an eye on it!"
Venerable Mi nodded, "Understood!"
With that, he quietly retreated.
Within the room, Ye Xuan sat cross-legged on the ground and started to study the Dao Scripture.
With this Dao Scripture, his Dao Sword and Dao Body would have a qualitative breakthrough!
Power!
Without power, everything was nonsense!
...
In the Fifth Dimension, Lian Zun looked down. Beside him was the Ancestor.
After a while, Lian Zun suddenly smiled, "If we make a move now, what are our chances of winning?"
The Ancestor shook his head, "Unknown!"
Lian Zun frowned, "Unknown?"
The Ancestor nodded, "I've calculated it, but the heavenly secrets here are illusory, especially that Ye Xuan. His fate cannot be determined!"
Lian Zun said softly, "So mysterious?"
The Ancestor nodded, "However, I suggest that we make a move as soon as possible!
Because this person is too monstrous, the longer we delay, the greater the price we will have to pay! "
Lian Zun was silent.
The Ancestor asked, "Are you worried about that plain-dressed girl?"
Lian Zun looked up into the depths of the starry sky, "I wonder about that plain-dressed girl!
That person's bloodline is not simple either!
I've never seen such a strange bloodline!
Other than that, don't forget that woman from the Sword Sect! "
Hearing this, the Ancestor's expression became solemn!
Situ Tingyun!
It was this woman that caused An Yuan to suffer heavy losses!
Lian Zun said, "I've already investigated. The Sword Sect below and Situ Tingyun's Sword Sect are in the Meridian Opening Realm … In other words, when we make a move, Situ Tingyun might also make a move!"
The Ancestor said solemnly, "But if we don't make a move now, once Mu Niannian recovers his memories and strength, then …"
Mu Niannian!
Hearing this, Lian Zun's expression turned solemn.
This woman had almost killed a Dao Ancestor with less than thirty percent of her strength. Most importantly, she had suppressed the entire Fifth Dimension by herself!
Conservatively speaking, this woman's strength was at least above the Dao Realm!
The previous master said solemnly, "No matter what, the longer we drag it out, the more disadvantageous it will be for us."
Lian Zun looked up towards the depths of the starry sky. "That Daofather should be finding that woman soon!"
The previous teacher asked, "What if that woman's strength exceeds our expectations?"
Lian Zun asked, "Is our Dark Abyss very weak?"
The previous teacher was silent.
Lian Zun said with a smile, "Whether it's Tingyun, Mu Niannian, or that woman in a plain dress, I only don't look down on them. I'm not afraid of them!
If it wasn't for the Ancient God Abyss, we would have destroyed them as well. "
The previous teacher hesitated for a moment before saying, "We still can't underestimate the enemy!"
Lian Zun slowly closed his eyes, "I won't underestimate the enemy, but I, the Dark Abyss, have never been afraid of anyone!"
Arrogant?
No, he was confident!
An Yuan had the capital to do so!
At this moment, Lian Zun suddenly asked, "Is there any movement from the Ancient God Abyss?"
The first teacher shook his head, "There's no movement!"
Lian Zun frowned. "Could it be that they aren't tempted by the Dao Scriptures?"
The previous master said solemnly, "It shouldn't be that he isn't tempted. He is probably observing in the dark and waiting for an opportunity."
After a moment of silence, Lian Zun said, "No matter what, let us know.
Keep an eye on them. "
The first master nodded, "Understood!"
Lian Zun looked down and chuckled, "Wait for the Dao Ancestor's news, then we will make our move!"
The previous teacher quietly retreated.
Lian Zun slowly closed his eyes and said softly, "Dao Ancestor should have found that woman by now …"
...
In the Five-Dimensional Universe.
Ten days later.
Ye Xuan walked out of the room and slowly closed his eyes. He operated the Dao Body Cultivation Method, and gradually, a mysterious aura appeared around his body!
Daoist Body Supreme Energy!
Ye Xuan glanced at the layer of Stellar Energy on his body. This layer of Stellar Energy was equivalent to a shield. If one wanted to hurt his body, they had to break through this layer of Stellar Energy first!
And the strength of this layer of Stellar Energy was dependent on his Dao Body!
In other words, the stronger his Dao Body was, the stronger this layer of Stellar Energy was!
Most importantly, as long as his body was not broken, he could continue to use this Stellar Energy!
Simply put, unless the opponent broke his Stellar Energy and body in an instant, he would be able to continuously use this Dao Body Supreme Energy!
As long as his Stellar Energy and body could not be broken in an instant, he was invincible!
It had to be said that even Ye Xuan felt that this Dao Scripture martial art and mental cultivation method was too abnormal!
Other than this Dao Body, the power of his Dao Sword had also been greatly enhanced, at least five times!
It could be said that the difference between this Dao Scripture martial art and the mental cultivation method was like heaven and earth!
Only with the assistance of the Dao Scripture martial art could it be considered a true Dao Scripture martial art!
At this moment, a woman suddenly appeared in front of Ye Xuan.
The person who came was an old acquaintance of his!
Ying Yaoyao!
Ye Xuan smiled, "Heavenly King, how have you been!"
Ying Yaoyao sized up Ye Xuan, "Your strength has increased again?"
Ye Xuan smiled, "You can say so!"
Ying Yaoyao glanced at Ye Xuan, "You are getting stronger by the day!"
Ye Xuan laughed, "Heavenly King, there must be something you need from me, right?"
Ying Yaoyao looked at Ye Xuan, "From what we know, the Dark Abyss might be making a move!"
The Dark Abyss!
Ye Xuan's smile gradually disappeared, "Do you know how many people they have?"
Ying Yaoyao shook her head, "Nothing."
Ye Xuan was silent.
Chi Yaoyao continued, "In any case, you have to be careful!
The Dark Abyss is not like Daoting, if they want to make a move, they will definitely be prepared for everything.
In other words, once they make a move, they might not give you any chance! "
Ye Xuan nodded, "Thank you for the reminder!"
Ying Yaoyao asked, "Have you come into contact with the Whirling World?"
Ye Xuan nodded, "Yes, I have!"
Chi Yaoyao said, "But you still have to be careful of them!
They haven't made a move yet, probably waiting for the Dark Abyss to make a move. "
Ye Xuan nodded, "I know!"
Ying Yaoyao hesitated, then asked, "When will Miss Nian Nian regain her memory?"
Ye Xuan smiled bitterly, "I don't know!"
Ying Yaoyao looked at Ye Xuan, not saying anything.
Ye Xuan said again, "I really don't know!"
Nian Nian showed no signs of regaining her memory.
Ying Yaoyao sighed softly, "I thought things would come to an end after the Daoting incident, but now the Whirling Sect and the Dark Abyss have appeared …"
With that, she glanced at Ye Xuan, "Take care!"
With that, she turned and left.
Ye Xuan was silent where he was.
At this moment, Nian Nian appeared beside Ye Xuan. She gently held Ye Xuan's hand, "Is it because of me?"
Ye Xuan shook his head, "It's not because of you, it's because of me."
Nian Nian tilted her head and looked at Ye Xuan, "Why?
Why? "
Ye Xuan said with a smile, "Because I have some good stuff that they all want!"
Nian Nian frowned slightly, "Why?"
Ye Xuan thought for a moment, then said, "Maybe I look easy to bully!"
Nian Nian blurted out, "I'll protect you!"
With that, she was stunned.
Ye Xuan was also stunned. She looked at Nian Nian, "Nian Nian … You …"
Nian Nian was a little confused, "I …"
Ye Xuan hurriedly said, "Did you remember something?"
Nian Nian shook her head, "No!
I … I don't know what happened to me just now. "
Ye Xuan gently rubbed Nian Nian's little head, smiled, "It's fine, it's fine. Let's go, I'll take you to roast fish!"
Hearing this, Nian Nian's eyes lit up, "Okay!"
Ye Xuan laughed, he took Nian Nian's hand and walked into the distance.
Behind the two of them was Venerated Mi.
At this moment, an old man appeared beside Venerated Mi, it was Bai Dizi.
Bai Dizi said softly, "Are you worried?"
Venerated Mi nodded, "But I don't think Dao Master is worried at all!"
Bai Dizi said, "He's not worried, he should have a plan to deal with it!"
Venerated Mi shook his head, "Recently, there have been some mysterious auras appearing in the Fifth Dimension, some of them are so powerful … I'm afraid they've already surpassed Dao Attainment!"
Bai Dizi was silent.
Venerated Mi sighed, "Those six scrolls of Dao Scriptures are really a disaster!"
Bai Dizi glanced at Venerated Mi, "Do you think if we hand them over, An Yuan will let him and the Fifth Dimension go?"
Venerated Mi frowned, "Why not?
Isn't their goal the six scrolls of Dao Scriptures? "
Bai Dizi looked at Venerated Mi, "If you were An Yuan, after snatching Ye Xuan's six scrolls of Dao Scriptures, would you still let him and Mu Niannian live?"
Venerated Mi was silent.
Definitely not!
Because if these two were alive, they would pose too great of a threat!
Thinking of this, Venerated Mi sighed.
Bai Dizi continued, "Whether it's An Yuan or Whirling Sect, they won't let Ye Xuan and Mu Niannian live, just like us!
If we don't kill Ye Xuan and Mu Niannian, once Ye Xuan grows up, or Mu Niannian recovers his memory and strength … At that time, who can withstand their revenge? "
Saying this, he looked at Ye Xuan and Nian Nian in the distance, whispering, "I've dealt with him so many times. This guy is very sinister, let's wait and see!"
Venerated Mi nodded, "That's the only way!"
Bai Dizi said, "I'm going to find Zhen Wu!"
Venerated Mi frowned, "Will he come back?"
Bai Dizi whispered, "I'll try my best to persuade him to come back!"
Saying this, he turned and disappeared into the horizon.
...
Somewhere in the starry sky, Dao Ancestor flew through the sky, his speed reaching the extreme. Wherever he passed, the starry sky trembled.
Looking for the plain-dressed woman!
In fact, he had long wanted to see who this woman was!
Because this woman was too mysterious!
She only needed one sword to kill!
This was the result of their investigation. Other than this, there was no other information!
How strong was she?
No one knew!
But Dao Ancestor knew, he would know soon!
At this moment, Dao Ancestor suddenly looked into the distance, his eyes narrowed, "I finally found you!
Let me see if you can kill me with one sword! "
Saying this, his speed suddenly increased.
.....
PS: Vote?







Chapter 1418
In the endless starry sky, the stars shone brightly, mysterious and tranquil.
How big was the universe?
No one knew!
Even the plain-dressed woman did not know.
She walked from the third dimension to the fifth dimension, but there was still no end to the starry sky.
The starry sky was the same as the path of martial arts. There was no end, and no one knew where it ended!
The vast universe was endless.
The plain-dressed woman walked slowly. She walked very slowly because she could not completely sense that person. To be precise, it was the source of the calamity.
Fate!
Everyone in the world was studying fate, including the owner of the Dao Scripture, but had fate really been studied?
Man conquers nature?
Many people were strong enough to change their fate, but who could be sure that the fate you changed was not your true fate?
In fact, she had tried to forcefully cut off the cause of the calamity on Ye Xuan's body. With her strength, it was not difficult at all to cut off the cause of the calamity. Just one sword was enough.
But she gave up in the end.
Because she realized that if she cut off the cause of the calamity, Ye Xuan would die.
There was only one explanation!
This cause of the calamity had a lot to do with Ye Xuan himself!
Fate was like an invisible hand that controlled everything in the dark.
Her goal was to find out who this giant hand belonged to, find it, and then kill it.
At this moment, a voice came from behind the plain-dressed woman, "I finally found you!"
The plain-dressed woman stopped in her tracks. A man suddenly appeared a hundred feet in front of her.
Dao Ancestor!
The Dao Ancestor looked at the plain-dressed woman and smiled, "It was not easy to find you!"
The plain-dressed woman looked at the Dao Ancestor and did not speak.
The Dao Ancestor chuckled, "I only came this time for one purpose, and that is to see how strong you are!"
"How strong?"
The plain-dressed woman said softly, "You want to know how strong I am?"
The Dao Ancestor looked at the plain-dressed woman, "Yes!"
The plain-dressed woman shook her head, "You will be disappointed!"
The Dao Ancestor frowned slightly, "What do you mean?"
The plain-dressed woman walked towards the Dao Ancestor, "I don't know myself, so how would you know?"
As the voice fell, the plain-dressed woman had already appeared tens of thousands of feet behind the Dao Ancestor.
In the same place, the Dao Ancestor looked into the distance, his eyes empty.
In between his eyebrows, there was a small sword hole!
The plain-dressed woman drew her sword!
She drew her sword!
However, he did not know when she had struck!
When did she do it?
Of course, this was not the main point!
Most importantly, his Daofather was dead!
Moreover, the woman in the plain dress had only used one sword strike!
Even at that moment, the Dao Ancestor still did not know how strong the woman in the plain dress was.
Because she only used one sword!
In the starry sky, the body of the Dao Ancestor became more and more illusory.
He knew that he was going to disappear completely.
At that moment, the Dao Ancestor suddenly smiled.
What are you laughing at?
He laughed at himself for being a frog in a well!
Before coming here, he felt that even if he wasn't a match for the woman in a plain dress, it wouldn't be a problem for him to escape unscathed.
However, only now did he realize how childish his thoughts were!
All this while, whether it was Daoting or An Yuan, they had both placed great importance on the plain-dressed lady. However, at this moment, he realized that they had underestimated her!
Great contempt!
When they faced the plain-dressed lady, they thought that she was at most at the Attainment of Dao. That was because the Attainment of Dao was already the highest realm they could come into contact with.
However, at that moment, he suddenly understood that the woman in the plain dress might be so strong that it was beyond their understanding.
It was very stupid to use their eyes and knowledge to measure the woman in the plain dress. Because no matter how much they valued her, they were actually underestimating her.
She was already so strong that it was beyond their understanding!
He only understood this at the moment of his death!
Apart from that, he also understood why no one knew how terrifying the woman in the plain dress was. It was because those who had seen her might have already died!
As if he thought of something, he said softly, "Ye Xuan … You have such a strong backing, why don't you say it … Isn't this harming others …"
As he said that, he opened his palm and a copper coin slowly floated up.
Soon, a voice rang out in the starry sky. "The woman in the plain dress … isn't that strong …"
This sentence disappeared in the starry sky along with the copper coin. The Dao Ancestor also disappeared along with it.
If he couldn't take revenge, then he would drag a few more people to be buried with him!
He also wanted to drag Ye Xuan to be buried with him, but his strength didn't allow him to!
Since he couldn't drag Ye Xuan to be buried with him, then he could drag others …
...
In the distance, the woman in the plain dress continued to move forward.
To her, what happened just now was just a small interlude. She didn't take it to heart at all.
After an unknown amount of time, the woman in the plain dress suddenly stopped. Not far in front of her, there was a huge city wall. This city wall spanned tens of thousands of miles across the starry sky, almost separating the entire starry sky.
On these city walls, there were statues holding long spears.
Behind the city wall, it was hazy and nothing could be seen.
The woman in the plain dress did not stop and continued to move forward.
Soon, the woman in the plain dress arrived at the city gate. The city gate was open and there was no one guarding it.
The woman in the plain dress continued to move forward. At this moment, a voice floated out from the city gate. "One more step and you will die!"
The woman in the plain dress glanced at the city gate. "You're begging for death!"
After saying that, she had already entered the city gate … A moment later, a bloody head rolled out of the city gate …
Inside the city gate, an angry shout suddenly rang out. "Who are you!?"
There was no response, but another head rolled out of the city gate.
Soon, a powerful aura suddenly shot into the sky from within the city gate. Following that, an ancient voice came from within the city gate, "Who are you … How dare you invade my Xuan City …"
Before the voice faded, another head rolled out from within the city gate.
At this moment, a voice rang out from within the city gate. "Senior, my Xuan City's words just now have offended you. Please forgive me …"
This time, no head rolled out from within the city gate.
A moment later, an incomparably respectful voice rang out from within the city gate. "We respectfully send off senior … Senior, take care …"
...
In the Five-Dimensional Universe.
In the starry sky, the previous master beside Lian Zun suddenly opened his eyes. In the next moment, a copper coin appeared in front of him.
Lian Zun looked at the previous master. "There's news?"
The previous master said softly, "The Dao Ancestor is dead!"
Dead!
Lian Zun frowned slightly. "Did he say anything?"
The previous master said solemnly, "He said that the woman in the plain dress is not that strong!"
Not that strong!
Lian Zun said softly, "Looks like he fought with the woman in the plain dress!"
The previous master was silent.
Lian Zun continued, "Looks like this woman in the plain dress will at most achieve the Dao!
If that's the case, then there's nothing to be afraid of! "
The previous master shook his head. "I still feel that this matter is not simple!"
Lian Zun looked at the previous master. "What do you mean?"
The previous master said solemnly, "I can't say for sure, but I have a bad feeling!"
After a moment of silence, Lian Zun shook his head. "No matter what, it's time to make a move."
As he said that, he looked down at the Five-Dimensional Universe. "If we continue to wait, once that Mu Niannian recovers his memories and strength, it will be troublesome!"
The previous master did not say anything. He raised his head and looked into the depths of the starry sky. He wanted to sense the woman in the plain dress, but he could not sense her at all!
As if he had thought of something, he took out the tortoise shell to make a divination. However, he could not calculate anything!
Lian Zun laughed. "Don't think too much!
As long as she doesn't surpass that level, we can deal with her. "
As he said that, he turned around and opened his palm. A black seal suddenly flew out. In the next moment, the seal directly turned into a pitch-black door. The door stood in the starry sky, and inside the door was a black whirlpool!
A moment later, the space inside the door suddenly trembled. Not long later, a thousand experts with spears and black shields walked out!
Underworld Army!
Among these thousand people, the lowest was at the Dao Validation Realm, and the equipment they were wearing were all top-notch equipment!
Other than these thousand people, there were six black-robed elders beside Lian Zun.
Six Dao Attainment Realm experts!
Including Lian Zun and the previous master, there were a total of eight Dao Attainment Realm experts!
Lian Zun suddenly laughed. "Let's go meet this Young Master Ye!"
After saying that, he disappeared.
Below, in the Five-Dimensional Universe, Ye Xuan, who was playing with Nian Nian, suddenly raised his head. After a moment of silence, he looked down at Nian Nian and said with a smile, "You play by yourself, I have something to do!"
Nian Nian gazed at Ye Xuan. "Alright!"
Ye Xuan grinned and was about to leave when Nian Nian suddenly grabbed his hand.
Ye Xuan looked at Nian Nian and smiled. "What's wrong?"
Nian Nian hesitated for a moment and said, "I'll wait for you!"
Ye Xuan smiled. "Alright!"
Nian Nian gazed at Ye Xuan. "Don't lie to me!"
Ye Xuan roared with laughter. "I definitely won't lie to you!"
As he spoke, he rubbed Nian Nian's little head lightly, and then he transformed into a ray of light that shot into the sky.
In the sky above Dao City, a ray of light descended in front of Lian Zun, and then it dispersed to reveal Ye Xuan's figure.
Lian Zun smiled. "Ye Xuan, we meet again!"
Ye Xuan grinned. "What's your name?"
Lian Zun smiled. "You can call me Lian Zun!"
Ye Xuan thought for a moment and said, "There doesn't seem to be any deep enmity between me and An Yuan!"
Lian Zun nodded. "Indeed!
However, we've taken a liking to the Daoist Scriptures in your possession!
So, can you give us those scrolls of Dao Scriptures? "
Ye Xuan smiled. "I, Ye Xuan, have always been very generous to my loved ones. Why don't you become one of my loved ones?
In that case, I'll give the Daoist Scriptures to you! "
Lian Zun frowned slightly. "Become one of your loved ones?"
Ye Xuan nodded. "Yes!
I'll take you as my son. In that way, aren't we family?
Since we're family, then what harm is there in giving them to you? "
Lian Zun's expression instantly turned cold. "Ye Xuan, do you only know how to use words?"
Ye Xuan chuckled. "You want the Daoist Scriptures yet aren't willing to be my son. Since you're not my son, then why should I give them to you?"
Lian Zun gazed at Ye Xuan. "Kill!"
Meanwhile, Ye Xuan suddenly opened his palm, and a sword appeared there. He roared with laughter, "Lian Zun, why don't we have a fight first?"
Lian Zun chuckled, "I have the advantage in numbers. Why should I fight you in a one on one battle?"
As he spoke, he looked down and his gaze fell on Nian Nian, who was on the street below. "Kill her!"
The true source of his fear was Mu Niannian!
When he heard Lian Zun, an old man at the Dao Attainment Realm charged towards Mu Niannian!
Suddenly, a ray of light appeared in front of the old man.
The old man frowned slightly, and then he raised his fist and swung it.
Bang!
The ray of light didn't shatter, but the old man was pushed over 30m back!
Lian Zun frowned when he witnessed this scene.
Ye Xuan's strength had exceeded his expectations!
Suddenly, Ye Xuan appeared in front of Lian Zun, and then he swung his sword.
Lian Zun's eyes narrowed slightly. Ye Xuan intends to kill me first. But is that even possible?
Suddenly, Lian Zun's expression changed drastically. Because an enormous Tai Chi diagram had suddenly appeared beneath Ye Xuan's feet!
Along with the appearance of the Tai Chi diagram, his cultivation had been forcefully suppressed from the peak of the Dao Attainment Realm to the Dao Control Realm!
He'd been directly suppressed by an entire realm!
Moreover, Lian Zun possessed four Domains!
Four Domains!
Moreover, Ye Xuan's attack was a Dao Sword, a strengthened version of the Dao Sword!
In an instant, Ye Xuan had practically utilized all his trump cards!
At this moment, terror appeared in Lian Zun's eyes. He hadn't expected that Ye Xuan would become so terrifying in an instant. He didn't give it any further thought. He'd lost the initiative, so he didn't even have a chance to dodge. He could only defend passively!
Lian Zun suddenly raised his arms, and a powerful force swept out from within him!
Bang!
Everyone watched as Ye Xuan's sword descended.
Bang!
Lian Zun's body was blasted into pieces!
Lian Zun's soul was about to flee. Meanwhile, Ye Xuan swung his sword with his left hand, and it struck Lian Zun's head. In an instant, Lian Zun's soul was absorbed!
It was an instant kill!
Ye Xuan sheathed his sword, and then he glanced at the dumbstruck crowd, "That's it?
I didn't even get to attack, and he fell! "
Everyone was speechless.
....







Chapter 1419
Silence!
Deathly silence!
No one expected Ye Xuan to kill Lian Zun in seconds!
Lian Zun was at the peak of the Dao Attainment Realm!
Let alone the Dark Abyss experts, even Venerable Mi and the rest on Ye Xuan's side were shocked.
Ye Xuan killed a Dao Attainment Realm expert in seconds!
This was too exaggerated!
In fact, even Ye Xuan himself was shocked!
His goal just now was to heavily injure Lian Zun, but he didn't expect to kill him instead!
Only now did he realize that he had underestimated his own strength all along!
It should be said that he underestimated the power of the Dao seal and Dao scripture!
The main reason he could kill Lian Zun in seconds was because of the Dao seal and Dao scripture!
One must know that the Dao seal not only brought him infinitely close to the Dao Attainment Realm, it also suppressed Lian Zun to the Dao Controlling Realm. Lian Zun no longer had an advantage in terms of cultivation realm!
Coupled with the suppression of his four domains and the element of surprise, Lian Zun was killed!
Ye Xuan collected his thoughts and looked at the Dark Abyss experts, "You guys don't really think I'm weak, do you?"
The ancestor stared at Ye Xuan, "Retreat!"
Retreat!
He now understood that the Dark Abyss had severely underestimated Ye Xuan's strength!
Ye Xuan's cultivation realm did not match his battle power!
"Retreat?"
Ye Xuan's lips curled up, "Do you think this is your home?
You can come and go as you please! "
With that, he drew his sword and charged out.
Venerable Mi and the rest also made their move!
Although the Fifth Dimension had fewer Dao Attainment Realm experts than the Dark Abyss, at this moment, the Fifth Dimension's momentum was like a rainbow!
In terms of momentum, the Fifth Dimension had crushed the Dark Abyss!
Ye Xuan had killed Lian Zun in seconds!
Not to mention the others, even Venerable Mi's confidence soared!
The ancestor did not choose to continue fighting, but retreated to the black door behind him!
Just as the ancestor and the rest were about to retreat, ten powerful auras suddenly appeared in front of the black door!
The one leading them was Su Ke!
In fact, when the Dark World came to the Fifth Dimension, he had been secretly preparing to act at any time!
Su Zhe had given a strict order to not let anything happen to Ye Xuan. However, he had not expected Ye Xuan to kill Lian Zun in a second!
In fact, at that moment, even he himself was stunned!
Did this Young Master Ye take medicine?
He actually became so ferocious!
Amidst his shock, he saw that his teacher and the others were about to retreat. At this time, he no longer remained silent and decisively chose to attack!
If the Ancestor and the others could die here, it would be a great thing for the Ancient God Abyss!
Seeing Su Ke and the others appear, the ancestor's face changed. "Ancient God Abyss, you …"
He did not expect the Ancient God Abyss to hit him when he was down!
Su Ke did not care about the previous teacher, and directly brought the nine people behind him and rushed forward!
Seeing the appearance of Su Ke and the others, Ye Xuan was stunned. He knew Su Ke, but he didn't know the people behind him. This wasn't the main point, the main point was, why would these people come to help him?
Could it be that her charm was too great?
....
On the other side, Xuan Chu and the old man beside her quietly watched as Ye Xuan and the others surrounded and killed the experts from the Dark Abyss.
Actually, both of them were extremely shocked at this moment.
Ye Xuan had just killed a Dao Attainment Realm expert in a second!
It was an instant kill!
Although he had used external items, it was still too terrifying!
Xuan Chu said softly, "We underestimated him!"
The old man was silent.
This was a serious underestimation!
Xuan Chu looked at Su Ke and the others. "These people should be from the Ancient God Abyss!
It seems that the Ancient God Abyss has chosen to stand on Ye Xuan's side! "
The old man said, "The Ancient God Abyss and the Dark Abyss are mortal enemies. It is not surprising that they would help Ye Xuan!"
Xuan Chu looked into the distance and did not speak.
The old man sighed softly.
This Ye Xuan was too good at pretending to be a pig to eat a tiger!
When the two of them went to see Ye Xuan, this guy kept showing weakness!
Too cunning!
On the other side, the Lord and the others were also there.
At this moment, the Lord and the others had extremely solemn expressions.
They had to admit that Ye Xuan's instant kill of a Dao Attainment Realm expert had shocked them!
That was the peak of the Dao Attainment Realm!
He had been instantly killed!
At this moment, the Lord suddenly said, "That is the Dao Seal, a treasure of the Daoting Realm. It used to Daoting our ancestors.
Not only can it increase the owner's strength, but it can also suppress the opponent's realm! "
When he spoke up to here, he paused for a moment and said, "But even then, it's still a bit too exaggerated!"
Yan Yaoyao looked at Ye Xuan in the distance. "It seems that we have not truly understood him!"
The Lord smiled and said, "He has indeed been giving us surprises!"
Luo Hou suddenly said, "Should we help him now?"
The Lord shook his head. "There is no point in helping him now."
Luo Hou was silent.
He naturally understood what the Lord meant. If they wanted to help, they should help first. If they helped now, they would not be sincere!
The Lord looked at Ye Xuan in the distance and smiled. "He does not need our help!"
As he said this, he seemed to have noticed something and frowned. "His sword …"
Everyone looked at Ye Xuan in the distance. At this moment, the sword in Ye Xuan's hand was constantly devouring the souls of the Dark Abyss experts!
At this moment, including the previous Lian Zun, the Soul Suppressing Sword had already absorbed the souls of four Dao Attainment Realm experts!
The rest of the Dao Attainment Realm experts were countless!
The Lord's expression was a little solemn. "This sword has probably broken through again!"
...
About an hour later, the battle ended!
The late master brought a few Dao Attainment experts and escaped, but the rest were all killed!
One should know that the Ancient God Abyss, including the Daoting, had a total of 13 Dao Attainment Realm experts!
Not far away, Ye Xuan put away his sword and walked in front of Su Ke. He smiled. "Senior, we meet again!"
Su Ke smiled. "A scholar has been separated for three days. My young friend is no longer the young friend from before!"
In fact, his heart was rather complicated. When he first met Ye Xuan, he still had the ability to kill Ye Xuan. But now, Ye Xuan already had the ability to kill him!
This speed of improvement was simply unimaginable!
Ye Xuan glanced at the people behind Su Ke and said, "Senior, you are from the Ancient God Abyss?"
Su Ke nodded. "Yes!"
Ye Xuan looked at Su Ke. "Senior, why did you help me?"
Su Ke hesitated and said, "We are mortal enemies with the Dark Abyss. The enemies of the Dark Abyss are the friends of the Ancient God Abyss!"
Ye Xuan said, "Is that all?"
Su Ke smiled. "My young friend, don't worry. The Ancient God Abyss has no ill intentions towards you."
Ye Xuan smiled. "Senior, you must be joking!
No matter what, thank you for your help just now. I, Ye Xuan, am eternally grateful! "
Su Ke said in a low voice, "My young friend, the Dark Abyss has failed this time. They will definitely not give up!
And this force is extremely powerful. You must be careful! "
He paused and said, "During this period of time, the ten of us will stay in the Fifth Dimension to prevent the Dark Abyss from launching a sneak attack!"
Ye Xuan hesitated for a moment and said, "You will stay in the Fifth Dimension to protect me?"
Su Ke asked, "Is there a problem?"
Ye Xuan looked at Su Ke. "Why?"
Su Ke thought for a moment and said, "We want to be friends with you!"
Ye Xuan's expression was slightly strange. Is my charm really that great?
At this time, Su Ke suddenly smiled bitterly. "My young friend, to tell you the truth, the reason we came to the Fifth Dimension is related to the senior behind you!"
The senior behind me?
Ye Xuan was struck dumb. Then he said, "Qing-er?"
Su Ke was surprised. "The senior in the plain dress?"
Ye Xuan nodded. "Yes!"
Su Ke looked at Ye Xuan. "I wonder what is the relationship between you two!"
Ye Xuan said, "I am her brother!"
Su Ke's expression was a bit strange. This younger sister is much stronger than her brother!
Although Ye Xuan is also strong, he is still not strong enough compared to the plain-dressed girl!
Ye Xuan sighed with emotion. Qing 'er!
In fact, he really wanted to see Qing 'er, but he didn't know where she was now!
At this time, a sword cry suddenly came from the side.
Ye Xuan turned his head and saw that the sword cry was from the Soul Suppressing Sword!
After absorbing so many souls, the Soul Suppressing Sword's aura was crazily rising!
Seeing this scene, Ye Xuan was happy. The Soul Suppressing Sword is about to break through!
As if thinking of something, Ye Xuan directly stored the Soul Suppressing Sword into the Prison Pagoda.
It's better to break through in the pagoda!
After that, Ye Xuan put away the equipment of the experts from the Dark Abyss. All of them were the best of the best. Even though they couldn't compare to the treasures of the Jia Long Clan, they were still top grade!
At this time, Su Ke suddenly said, "Little friend, I will leave first!
You must be careful during this period of time!
That Dark Abyss is not a good person. You must not underestimate it! "
Ye Xuan nodded. "Understood!
Thank you for your help, Senior! "
Su Ke smiled. "You are too polite!
From today onwards, my Ancient God Abyss and the Fifth Dimension are allies! "
As he said that, he specially looked at Xuan Chu and Su Ke.
Ye Xuan felt a little emotional. He naturally knew that the reason why the Ancient God Abyss was so friendly to him was because of Qing 'er!
Needless to say, Qing 'er must have been to the Ancient God Abyss!
He just didn't know if the Ancient God Abyss was beaten …
He knew that Qing 'er's temper was not very good.
Su Ke didn't say anything else. He turned around and left.
As for the 10 Dao Realm experts he brought with him, they stayed in the Fifth Dimension!
Ye Xuan looked at Venerable Mi. "Senior Mi, clean up the battlefield!"
Venerable Mi nodded. "Alright!"
Ye Xuan turned around and left.
Everyone looked at each other. They hadn't expected the matter to end just like that!
On the other side, Xuan Chu said softly, "Looks like the Ancient God Abyss didn't become friends with Ye Xuan because they are mortal enemies with the Dark Abyss!"
The old man fell silent.
At this moment, he realized that the matter was getting more and more troublesome!
Xuan Chu suddenly looked down. "The Dark Abyss will definitely not give up!
Let us wait and see! "
As she spoke, she paused for a moment and said, "Elder, send an order to my Master. Ask her to come here!"
The old man was stunned, and then he said, "This … why?"
Xuan Chu looked at the old man. "The two of us can't hold this place down!"
The old man. "…"
...
Below, Ye Xuan arrived on the street. As soon as he landed, Nian Nian threw herself into his arms. She hugged Ye Xuan tightly as if she was afraid that Ye Xuan would lose her …
Ye Xuan was about to speak when Nian Nian suddenly looked up at Ye Xuan. At some point, her face was covered in tears.
Ye Xuan felt an indescribable pain in his heart. He hurriedly said, "Don't cry!
Who bullied you! "
Nian Nian looked at Ye Xuan as her tears flowed uncontrollably. "Am I very useless?
I can't help you at all … "
Ye Xuan was about to speak when the space beside him suddenly split open. A moment later, a figure floated out!
Ye Xuan's expression changed drastically when he saw this. He suddenly drew his sword and slashed.
The sword slashed down!
Chi!
The sword slashed through the air!
Ye Xuan was alarmed. He activated his Dao Seal and was about to attack again when the figure had already retreated a hundred feet away. At the same time, Nian Nian was beside him.
Above the Dao Attainment Realm!
Ye Xuan's expression instantly turned ferocious. The figure suddenly grabbed Nian Nian's shoulder with his right hand. "If you want to save her, bring the six Dao Scriptures to the mortal world. Come alone!
If you don't come within two hours, her soul will be destroyed! "
With that, he and Mu Niannian disappeared.
At this moment, Nian Nian's weak voice came from afar. "Don't … Come …"
In the same place, Ye Xuan held the sword in his right hand tightly. His entire body emitted an extremely terrifying killing intent and hostility.
...
PS: Now that Qing Luan is in my hands, if you want to save her, give me the ticket. If not, I'll kill her!
Do as you see fit!







Chapter 1420
Venerated Mi and the others appeared the moment the figure and Nian Nian vanished.
Venerated Mi and the others' expressions darkened when they saw Nian Nian being taken away!
They hadn't expected An Yuan to send an expert above the Dao Realm!
Meanwhile, Su Ke suddenly appeared with an old man by his side. It was Su Zhe.
Su Zhe looked at Ye Xuan and hesitated for a moment before he said, "My friend, I'm sorry. The Old Man is late!"
Actually, Su Ke had gone back to invite Su Zhe over!
He knew that An Yuan would never let the matter rest, and if An Yuan wanted to make a move, he would definitely send an expert above the Dao Realm!
Because an expert at the Dao Realm was no longer a threat to Ye Xuan!
Therefore, he had decided to invite Su Zhe over. However, he hadn't expected An Yuan to act so quickly!
Ye Xuan took a deep breath and looked at Su Zhe, "Senior, where is the Milky Way?"
Su Zhe hesitated for a moment before he said, "It's a very dangerous place!
It's a forbidden place because anyone who steps into the Mortal World will have their cultivation sealed and become a mortal! "
Ye Xuan looked at Su Zhe, "How do I get there?"
Su Zhe said solemnly, "My friend, you'd better not go!
Because your cultivation will be sealed and you will become a mortal.
However, An Yuan won't do that!
Because the Mortal World was created by the owner of the Dark Scripture. Anyone who cultivates the Dark Scripture will not be suppressed by the Dark Dao Laws there.
The reason he wants you to go there is because he knows that he can't kill you in the outside world. However, if you go there, we … "
Ye Xuan closed his eyes slowly, "Senior, just tell me how to get there!"
Su Zhe wanted to persuade him but Ye Xuan suddenly opened his eyes. His eyes were bloodshot!
The power of his bloodline was surging!
Su Zhe was shocked. Ye Xuan's bloodline was actually so powerful!
After a while, Su Ke sighed softly and pointed with his finger. A ray of white light entered between Ye Xuan's brows.
Just as Ye Xuan was about to disappear, a voice came from the side, "Remember to come back!"
The one who spoke was Zhang Wenxiu.
Ye Xuan disappeared into the horizon.
Zhang Wenxiu looked at the sword ray in the horizon and a voice floated over, "I'll try my best!"
Try my best!
Zhang Wenxiu was stunned.
Su Ke looked at Su Zhe, "We …"
Su Zhe shook his head, "There's no other way!"
Su Zhe said, "There's no other way!
It was not because he, the Dark scripture master was because he was the disciple of the Dao Scripture's disciple.
One had to know that the owner of the Dark Scripture was the disciple of the Dao Scripture's owner. He created the Dark Scripture based on the Dao Scripture. How terrifying was his strength?
The Wan had the Yan had always had the Aby. The Yan had always had always had always but they always had the Dragon. Zhang had always had always. The Gu Ancient had the Had the Wan.
The Ancient God Abyss would enter the Mortal World as soon as the Dark Abyss was in danger. At that time, the Ancient God Abyss would not be able to do anything!
The Ancient God Abyss wanted Ye Xuan to go to the Mortal World for a simple reason. It was to deal with the Ancient God Abyss and the people behind Ye Xuan!
As long as Ye Xuan entered the Mortal World, the Ancient God Abyss would not dare to make a move. As for the people behind Ye Xuan, no matter how strong they were, would they dare to go to the Mortal World?
It was fair to say that for Ye Xuan, this was a deadly trap!
At this moment, an old man suddenly appeared in front of them.
It was the Master who had escaped earlier.
It was not his real body, but a shadow!
The Master looked at Su Zhe, "Su Zhe, the Honoured One said that he did not expect you to protect Ye Xuan personally!"
Su Zhe was expressionless, "I did not expect the Honoured One of the Three Masters of the Dark Abyss to come personally!"
The Master who had kidnapped Mu Niannian was the Honoured One of the Three Masters of the Dark Abyss!
The Master laughed, "This …
We have won this battle! "
Su Zhe smiled, "Is that so?"
The Master smiled, "We welcome the people behind Ye Xuan to the Mortal World!
They must come, otherwise, we will be disappointed! "
After saying that, he disappeared.
Su Zhe was silent for a moment, then he asked softly, "Will she go …"
The 'she' he was referring to was the woman in the plain dress!
At this moment, a voice suddenly rang out, "Where is he?"
Su Zhe turned his head, there was a woman standing in front of him.
Su Zhe looked at the woman in front of him, his eyes full of wariness.
He did not know when this person had appeared in front of him!
Who was this?
Su Zhe asked in a low voice, "Your Excellency … you are?"
The woman looked at Su Zhe, "Where is he?"
Su Zhe hesitated, "My friend Ye Xuan?"
The woman nodded.
Su Zhe said in a low voice, "The people from the Dark Abyss sent him to the Mortal World!"
The woman looked into the depths of the starry sky, "How?"
Su Zhe hesitated for a moment, then said, "Senior, the Mortal World was created by the owner of the Dark Scripture, it has the Law of Darkness, it can suppress one's cultivation …"
The woman suddenly asked, "How do we get there?"
Su Zhe looked at the woman, she blinked, "Don't I look like an expert?"
Su Zhe was speechless.
The woman said again, "Show me the way!"
Su Zhe hesitated for a moment, then bent his finger and a ray of white light entered the woman's forehead. After a while, the woman was about to leave, but at this moment, Zhang Wenxiu suddenly asked, "You are?"
The woman looked at Zhang Wenxiu and asked, "You are?"
Zhang Wenxiu looked at the woman, "I am his woman!"
Woman!
The woman blinked, "His woman?"
Zhang Wenxiu looked straight at the woman, "Yes!"
The woman looked at Zhang Wenxiu and smiled, "I like your character!"
As she said that, she opened her palm, "Let's go, I'll bring you to see your man!"
Zhang Wenxiu hesitated for a moment, then walked over to the woman and held her hand.
The woman was about to leave with Zhang Wenxiu when she seemed to have noticed something. She suddenly turned her head and looked at Xiao Qi.
When she saw Xiao Qi, the woman was slightly stunned, then she nodded slightly as a greeting.
Xiao Qi looked at the woman, not saying a word.
At this moment, Zhang Wenxiu suddenly asked, "Senior, you are?"
The woman smiled, "According to seniority, he should call me aunt!"
As she said that, she looked into the distance, "Let's not waste any more time!
This clone has gone through too many galaxies and wasted too much energy. It can't stay for too long, let's go! "
As soon as she finished speaking, she vanished on the spot with Zhang Wenxiu.
In the field, Su Zhe and the others felt like they had been struck by lightning!
Clone!
It was just a clone!
Su Zhe felt his head spinning!
At that moment, he had felt an incomparable sense of danger, but he had never thought that this woman was just a clone!
Just a clone was enough to make him feel an incomparable sense of danger. What did this mean?
If the real body was here, how terrifying would it be?
Thinking of this, Su Zhe could not help but break out in cold sweat.
At this moment, Su Ke suddenly said softly, "His father, his brother, his sister, his senior sister, his aunt … This is too much …"
Su Zhe was speechless.
...
Somewhere in the galaxy, the woman was holding Zhang Wenxiu's hand as they flew through the air.
Zhang Wenxiu looked at the woman, "Senior …"
The woman smiled, "Call me aunt!"
Zhang Wenxiu hesitated, then said, "Aunt … He's not an ordinary person, right?"
The woman nodded, "He's not an ordinary person!"
Zhang Wenxiu was silent.
The woman said softly, "His background is very complicated, I can't explain it clearly."
Zhang Wenxiu was silent for a moment, then said, "Are you guys very far away?"
The woman nodded, "Very far away. It's not easy to come here."
Zhang Wenxiu was silent.
The woman glanced at Zhang Wenxiu, smiled, "I should bring you to see someone!"
Zhang Wenxiu looked at the woman, "Who?"
The woman smiled, "His mother!"
Zhang Wenxiu said in a low voice, "Dugu Xuan?"
The woman shook her head, "His real mother!"
Zhang Wenxiu frowned, "Dugu Xuan is not his real mother?"
The woman hesitated, then said, "You can say that!
But … Sigh, this matter is very complicated!
It's all because of the Disaster Cause, I can't explain it clearly to you. "
Zhang Wenxiu suddenly asked, "How strong is the woman in the plain dress?"
She had always been curious about the woman in the plain dress.
The woman was silent.
Zhang Wenxiu looked at the woman, then asked, "Aunt, can you beat her?"
The woman blinked, "Can I not answer this question?"
Zhang Wenxiu was speechless.
...
Somewhere in the starry sky, Ye Xuan flew on his sword, he raised his speed to the limit, everywhere he passed, sword qi tore through the starry sky, it was incomparably terrifying!
In Ye Xuan's body, the blood was boiling, his whole body seemed to be on fire!
Soon, Ye Xuan arrived in front of a black hole, he turned into a sword light and entered the black hole.
Boom!
The entire black hole shook violently, sword qi tore through the black hole!
Soon, Ye Xuan showed up in a starry sky. As soon as he showed up in this starry sky, he felt all of his cultivation had disappeared!
But his bloodline power was still there!
The Great Dao law could suppress his cultivation, but it could not suppress his bloodline power!
At this moment, a middle-aged man suddenly appeared not far from Ye Xuan.
Human Venerable!
One of the three great venerables of the Dark Abyss!
On the right side of the Human Venerable was Nian Nian!
Ye Xuan's gaze fell on Nian Nian, Nian Nian kept crying, "I … I'm sorry …"
Ye Xuan shook his head, "You're not sorry!
I'm sorry!
Don't be afraid, even if I die, I'll be with you, okay? "
Nian Nian lowered her head slightly, her body trembling, she clenched her fists tightly, nails digging into her palms, blood flowing.
Human Venerable looked at Ye Xuan, "Just you?"
Ye Xuan nodded, "Yes!"
Human Venerable looked at Ye Xuan, "Where's the Dao scripture?"
Ye Xuan said, "Let her go!"
Human Venerable shook his head, "You're not qualified to negotiate with me!"
Ye Xuan looked at Human Venerable, "If you don't let her go, don't even think about getting the Dao scripture!
You can kill her, because before I came, I was already prepared to die!
But if you die like this, the six Dao scriptures will fall into the hands of Ancient God Abyss! "
Human Venerable chuckled, "Threatening me?
I won't kill her, I'll torture her until you hand over the Dao scripture!
Let's see who's more patient! "
With that said, he suddenly placed his right hand on Nian Nian's head, a powerful force enveloped her, following that, Nian Nian's entire face twisted, because her bones were being crushed bit by bit …
Nian Nian was in extreme pain!
But she did not cry!
She looked at Ye Xuan, forcing a smile that was uglier than crying, "I … don't … hurt …"
...







Chapter 1421
"It doesn't hurt?"
Venerable Human looked at Nian Nian and smiled, "How interesting!
It seems that not only does he care about you, you also care about him! "
Saying that, he was about to exert force, but at this time, Ye Xuan suddenly opened his palm. In his palm, there were six Dao Scriptures.
Venerable Human looked at Ye Xuan, the corners of his mouth slightly raised, his smile bright, "Have you lost your patience?"
Ye Xuan's expression was calm, "Can you let her go?"
Venerable Human released Mu Niannian, he slowly walked towards Ye Xuan, smiling, "Ye Xuan, do you know?
When you appeared in this place, I suddenly realized that I overestimated you.
You have guts, you have intelligence, and you have strength.
Unfortunately, you are not ruthless enough!
You may be ruthless enough to your enemies, but you are not ruthless enough to your own people.
What you don't know is that your so-called loyalty is meaningless, because these are your weaknesses, weaknesses that your enemies can exploit! "
Ye Xuan suddenly bent his finger, the six Dao Scriptures appeared in front of Venerable Human, and he himself appeared in front of Nian Nian.
Venerable Human put away the six Dao Scriptures, he glanced at Ye Xuan, but did not stop Ye Xuan.
In this place, he was invincible!
Ye Xuan gently hugged Nian Nian, but with this hug, Nian Nian suddenly sucked in a breath of cold air. She looked at Ye Xuan, tears streaming down her face, feeling wronged, "It hurts …"
Ye Xuan quickly let go, he gently grabbed Nian Nian's hand, looking at Nian Nian's broken bones, his heart felt like it was being twisted by a knife, "I'm sorry …"
Nian Nian looked at Ye Xuan, tears streaming down her face, "I'm sorry, I still can't remember the past … I … I'm too useless!"
"How ridiculous!"
At this time, the distant Venerable Human suddenly laughed, "It's really ridiculous!
Fifth Dimension Tendo, although I don't know your true strength, you were able to injure a Dao Completion Realm expert with less than 30% of your strength, so you must have some skill!
What's laughable is that, for the sake of this Ye Xuan and that so-called Five-Dimensional Universe, you didn't even use seventy percent of your strength until your death … For an expert like you to not sever the karma that binds you, I can only say that you're really stupid. "
Nian Nian looked at Ye Xuan. "Will we die?"
Ye Xuan gently caressed Nian Nian's cheek and smiled. "Are you afraid?"
Nian Nian shook her head. "With you around, I'm not afraid!"
Ye Xuan suddenly said, "Can I kiss you?"
Nian Nian blinked. "Kiss me?"
Ye Xuan nodded.
Nian Nian's face was slightly red, and her voice was as soft as a mosquito. "Just once!"
Ye Xuan said seriously, "You agreed!
You can't hit me in the future! "
Nian Nian slowly closed her eyes, feeling a little shy. "Kiss me!
I won't hit you in the future! "
Ye Xuan leaned over and gently touched Nian Nian's forehead.
They separated at the touch!
Nian Nian opened her eyes and glanced at Ye Xuan. "Is it over?"
Ye Xuan nodded. "It's over!
However, I'm a little regretful! "
Nian Nian blinked. "Why!"
Ye Xuan looked at Nian Nian and said seriously, "If we can survive today, I think I'll definitely be beaten by you in the future!
However, it doesn't matter!
Who knows if there's a tomorrow? "
With that, he leaned over and gently touched Nian Nian's forehead. "Even if I'm gone!
You have to live well, understand? "
With that, he suddenly stored Nian Nian into the Creation Gourd. He grabbed the Creation Gourd and threw it toward the exit of the mortal world. He roared, "Take her away!
To the Four-Dimensional Universe's Netherworld Palace! "
Not far away, the Human Venerable suddenly laughed. "Let her go?
Are you kidding me? "
With that, he was about to make a move. At this moment, Ye Xuan suddenly appeared in front of him. In the next moment, an extremely powerful bloodline power swept out from his body.
Boom!
In an instant, a killing intent swept across the heaven and earth!
This place had the laws of darkness which could suppress one's cultivation. However, it could not suppress Ye Xuan's bloodline!
Seeing that Ye Xuan could actually use the power of his bloodline, the Human Venerable frowned. "How is this possible!"
At this moment, Ye Xuan suddenly slashed forward!
It was not a dao sword because he could not use a dao sword at all!
He also could not use a dao seal!
This place could even suppress a dao seal!
To put it simply, other than the power of his bloodline and his dao body, he could not use any other power or external objects!
The sword slashed down. The sword stopped half an inch away from the Human Venerable's head!
The Human Venerable's two fingers caught Ye Xuan's sword!
The Human Venerable looked at Ye Xuan. "I underestimated your bloodline power!"
With that, he slightly tightened his fingers.
Boom!
In an instant, Ye Xuan was blasted hundreds of feet away!
After repelling Ye Xuan with one finger, the Human Venerable suddenly turned his head and looked in the direction where the Gourd of Fortune escaped. At present, compared to Ye Xuan, Mu Niannian was a greater threat!
The Human Venerable was about to make a move when a sword qi slashed at him from behind!
The Human Venerable frowned. He suddenly turned around and took a step forward. At the same time, he punched out.
Before Ye Xuan's sword fell, the Human Venerable's fist had already landed on his chest.
Bang!
Ye Xuan spat out a mouthful of blood and was instantly sent flying thousands of feet away. However, in the next moment, he once again rushed toward the Human Venerable with his sword.
The blood-red sword light tore through the space. The blood-red light was overwhelming!
In the distance, the Human Venerable slowly clenched his right hand. His eyes were filled with cold killing intent. "It's time to end this!"
With that said, he suddenly disappeared.
Chi!
In the field, the space suddenly cracked. In the next moment, a shadow directly hit Ye Xuan.
Boom!
The sword light around Ye Xuan was directly smashed. At the same time, Ye Xuan was sent flying. As soon as he stopped, the Human Venerable suddenly appeared in front of him!
The Human Venerable directly punched at Ye Xuan's throat!
Ye Xuan blocked with his sword.
Boom!
Once again, Ye Xuan and his sword were sent flying!
In the air, the Human Venerable punched again!
As the punch was thrown, the space cracked inch by inch. In the distance, a fist suddenly landed on Ye Xuan's chest.
Puff!
Ye Xuan suddenly spat out a mouthful of blood and was thrown backward.
The Human Venerable looked at Ye Xuan and sneered. "The legendary Taoist Body. If it was outside, it might be a little tricky. Unfortunately, it's here!
Today, let me shatter your Taoist Body! "
As his voice fell, he rushed forward and punched!
The punch was like a flash flood, unstoppable!
In the distance, Ye Xuan's pupils suddenly shrank. He did not choose to defend. Instead, he stabbed with his sword.
A life for a life!
However, the Human Venerable's speed was much faster than his!
The moment he attacked with his sword, the Human Venerable's fist had already landed on his chest.
Bang!
Ye Xuan's chest caved in. At the same time, the Human Venerable's powerful strength directly sent him flying.
Although the Taoist Body was strong, at this moment, his cultivation was suppressed. His strength was less than half of his peak. Especially, he could not use a killer move like the Taoist Sword.
It could be said that he was being suppressed by the Human Venerable in both speed and strength!
After sending Ye Xuan flying with a punch, the Human Venerable did not stop. Instead, he took a step forward and threw a punch with each step.
The punch was like a volcanic eruption, destroying heaven and earth!
In the distance, Ye Xuan's eyes flashed with anger. He held the Executing Heaven Sword with both hands and slashed forward.
At this moment, the Human Venerable's punch arrived.
Boom!
The surrounding space trembled. The Human Venerable's powerful punch directly sent the sword in Ye Xuan's hand flying. At the same time, a destructive force instantly landed on Ye Xuan's body.
Bang!
Ye Xuan was instantly sent flying thousands of feet away. As soon as he stopped, he spat out several mouthfuls of blood. At the same time, his body had already split open!
If this was outside, his body could continuously repair itself. But here, his cultivation was suppressed and he could not repair his body at all!
The Human Venerable slowly walked toward Ye Xuan. He slowly clenched his right hand and a powerful force gathered in his palm. Because the force was so strong, the space around him directly trembled!
In the distance, Ye Xuan wiped the blood from his mouth.
He looked at the exit in the distance and said softly, "She should be safe now!"
He knew that as long as Immortal Gourd brought Nian Nian to the Nether World Hall, even the Dark Abyss could not do anything to her!
Thinking of this, the corner of Ye Xuan's mouth curled up into a smile. But soon, the smile froze!
At the exit, he saw a person!
Nian Nian!
In Nian Nian's hand was a gourd!
Immortal Gourd!
Seeing Nian Nian, the Human Venerable was stunned for a moment. Then, he laughed. "How interesting!"
In the distance, Ye Xuan's eyes widened. "Immortal Gourd!
What the hell are you doing! "
At this moment, Immortal Gourd appeared in front of Ye Xuan with Nian Nian. At the same time, Immortal Gourd's voice sounded in Ye Xuan's mind. "Sigh, you can't blame me!
I want to take her away too!
But she won't go!
If I take her away by force, she will kill herself … I really can't help it … It's too f * cking difficult for me! "
Ye Xuan roared angrily. "Your current strength far surpasses hers. Can't you stop her from killing herself?"
Immortal Gourd was a little helpless. "I can beat her now, but she threatened me!
She said that if I take her away, when she regains her memory, she will tear me to pieces … You know how terrifying she was at her peak … I'm scared! "
He had been beaten by Mu Niannian in the past. He was really afraid of Mu Niannian!
Ye Xuan was speechless.
Nian Nian stared at Ye Xuan. "You said you wouldn't lie to me!"
Ye Xuan felt a little guilty. "I … I didn't lie to you!"
Nian Nian said angrily, "You left me alone!"
Ye Xuan shrugged. "You did the same thing in the past!"
Nian Nian burst into tears.
After crying for a while, she looked up at Ye Xuan. "Then we're even!
Now, no one can leave the other, okay? "
Ye Xuan was silent.
Nian Nian looked at Ye Xuan. "I don't want to live alone!"
Ye Xuan was silent for a moment. He took Nian Nian's hand and said softly, "Okay!
No one can leave the other! "
Nian Nian smiled through her tears. She gently hugged Ye Xuan and said in a trembling voice, "I'm afraid of death, but I'm even more afraid of living alone … Don't leave me …"
At this moment, the Human Venerable in the distance suddenly said, "Ye Xuan, where's the woman in the plain dress behind you?"
Ye Xuan looked at the Human Venerable. The Human Venerable smiled and said, "Isn't she your Path Protector?
Why hasn't she appeared at a time like this?
Don't tell me she's afraid! "
Ye Xuan was about to speak. At this moment, the space in the distance was suddenly torn apart. The next moment, two women walked out of the torn space!
Seeing the two women, Ye Xuan was stunned.
He knew one of them. It was Zhang Wenxiu!
But he didn't know the woman next to Zhang Wenxiu!
The Human Venerable's gaze fell on the woman next to Zhang Wenxiu, "You're not the woman in the plain dress!"
The woman smiled and said, "You seem a little disappointed!"
The Human Venerable smiled and said, "I am indeed a little disappointed.
Because we prepared a big gift for her. Unfortunately, she didn't come!
What a pity!
But it's okay, we can kill her in the future! "
"Kill her!"
The woman blinked, and in the next moment, she suddenly disappeared.
The Human Venerable's expression changed. He suddenly punched out. The power of the punch was like a mountain flood, shaking the heaven and earth!
However, as soon as he punched out, a jade-white hand grabbed his throat!
One hit kill!
The Human Venerable's expression changed. He looked at the woman and said in horror, "You're not suppressed!
How is that possible … "
The woman looked at the Human Venerable and smiled, "Kill my Great Mandate?
You idiot, I can't even take one of her sword. You want to kill her? I'll kill your mother!
I'll kill your mother! "
Then, she suddenly clenched her fist.
Boom!
The Human Venerable's head exploded and turned into nothingness!
Ye Xuan: "…"
.....
PS: I want to be scolded.







Chapter 1422
Shocking!
Ye Xuan had to admit that even he was shocked!
An instant kill!
This woman killed a Human Venerable in an instant!
What level was this Human Venerable?
She was a cultivator above the Dao Attainment realm!
Such a cultivator was killed by this woman in an instant!
This was too terrifying!
At this moment, Zhang Wenxiu was also extremely shocked. She knew that the woman who came with her was very strong, but she didn't expect her to be this strong!
As if thinking of something, Zhang Wenxiu's pupils shrank.
This woman said that she couldn't even take one strike from the woman in the plain dress …
The woman in the plain dress!
How strong was she?
Zhang Wenxiu's heart was in turmoil!
Not far away, the woman clapped her hands and turned to look at Ye Xuan. "I've been traveling for a few days and I only killed this piece of trash … Don't you feel ashamed?"
Ye Xuan: "…"
Zhang Wenxiu hurriedly said, "Aunty, you've worked hard!"
Aunty?
Ye Xuan was stunned, then looked at Zhang Wenxiu. "Your aunty?"
Zhang Wenxiu said in a low voice, "What's mine is also yours!"
Ye Xuan: "…"
The woman walked to Ye Xuan and looked at Ye Xuan. "To be precise, I'm your aunty!"
Aunty!
Ye Xuan blinked. "Are there second aunties and third aunties?"
The woman nodded. "Yes!"
Ye Xuan: "…"
Zhang Wenxiu: "…"
Ye Xuan said in a low voice, "My mother and aunty, you …"
The woman smiled. "We call your mother sisters. As for your mother, I can't say much. You'll know in the future."
Ye Xuan was speechless.
In the future again!
The woman looked around and said, "This place is a little special …"
As she spoke, she looked at Ye Xuan. "This clone of mine is about to disappear.
You'll have to deal with the rest yourself! "
Ye Xuan asked in a deep voice, "Aunt, where is your main body?"
The woman smiled. "I'm busy!"
Ye Xuan asked again, "Is it far from here?"
The woman nodded. "It's very far. Most importantly, some of the rules are very troublesome, and we don't want to break them … In short, it's quite troublesome for us to come here."
Ye Xuan said in a deep voice, "The Nether Pavilion!"
The woman smiled and said, "You only guessed it now?"
Ye Xuan shook his head and smiled. "I guessed it!
But I'm not sure! "
The woman looked at Ye Xuan. "You said you were an orphan in the Nether World Hall and had no one to rely on … Kid, I'm here today to tell you two things. First, it's not that your father doesn't care about you. He has done a lot for you, but you don't know about it!
Second, you think your enemies are strong now, but you don't know that your enemies in the future are even stronger!
Just like me … Do you think I'm strong? "
Ye Xuan quickly nodded.
The woman smiled. "But the Nether Pavilion is in a dangerous moment!
The reason why my main body didn't come this time is because of this! "
Ye Xuan fell silent.
The woman patted Ye Xuan's shoulder lightly. "This is the last time we'll help you, because we're not sure if we can survive!
You're on your own! "
After saying that, her body gradually turned illusory.
Ye Xuan bowed slightly to the woman. "Aunt, thank you!"
The woman smiled. "We're family, no need to be so polite!"
As she spoke, she looked at Nian Nian, who was beside Ye Xuan. Nian Nian hesitated for a moment before saying softly, "Aunt …"
The woman laughed. "I don't deserve that!"
Ye Xuan quickly said, "Aunt, can you help Nian Nian recover her memory?"
The woman shook her head. "No!"
Ye Xuan was slightly puzzled. "Why not?"
The woman looked at Ye Xuan and smiled. "Can I not answer this question?"
Ye Xuan was speechless.
The woman thought for a moment and said, "Forget it!
I'll answer you!
The reason why I can't help her recover her memory is because she's too strong. I can't stop her! "
As she spoke, she glanced at Nian Nian. "She's an extraordinary woman!"
Ye Xuan frowned slightly. "Too strong?"
The woman smiled. "Her Sword Dao is the strongest besides those three. Hmm, that's not right. That girl Tingyun should be on par with her. However, your Sister Nian's strength isn't just in her Sword Dao … In short, she has her own Dao.
(This chapter is not over. Please continue to the next page.)
Moreover, she's very strong. Ordinary people can't forcefully interfere with what she does.
So, let nature take its course!
In any case, she has no intention of harming you! "
Ye Xuan wanted to ask more, but the woman had already vanished.
She left in a carefree manner!
After a moment of silence, Ye Xuan left with Zhang Wenxiu and Nian Nian.
Of course, Ye Xuan did not forget the six Dao Scriptures. When the woman killed the Human Supremacy, he had already kept them.
Not long after Ye Xuan and the others left, a middle-aged man suddenly appeared in the Mortal World.
The middle-aged man looked around and said softly, "I'm late …"
This person was one of the Three Supremacies of the Dark Abyss, the Earth Supremacy.
Previously, when the Human Supremacy's Soul Tablet shattered, he rushed over here. Unfortunately, he was still too late.
The Earth Supremacy looked around with a solemn expression. "Good one, Ye Xuan!
Looks like we've underestimated you! "
After saying that, his figure trembled slightly and disappeared.
...
In the Fifth Dimension.
When Ye Xuan and the others returned to the Fifth Dimension, Su Zhe and Su Ke immediately appeared in front of Ye Xuan. Su Zhe looked at Ye Xuan and said, "Little friend, that Human Supremacy …"
Ye Xuan said, "He's dead!"
Dead!
Su Zhe looked at Ye Xuan and asked, "Then Senior killed him?"
Ye Xuan nodded.
Su Zhe was silent.
One of the Three Supremacies of the Dark Abyss, Human Supremacy, was dead!
Ye Xuan looked at Su Zhe and asked, "Senior, how can I reach the Dao Realm?"
Su Zhe shook his head. "You can't!"
Ye Xuan frowned slightly. "Why?"
Su Zhe sighed softly. "Little friend, you've just broken through not long ago. It's not wise to force your way into the Dao Realm now!
Moreover, you haven't fully stabilized your Dao Defense Realm. It's not suitable for you to break through to the Dao Realm! "
Ye Xuan was silent.
Su Zhe continued, "Of course, if you borrow the power of the God's Seal, it's not impossible. However, I don't recommend you to use the God's Seal. You're a genius, you can definitely create your own path!"
Ye Xuan said softly, "I don't have that much time!"
The Human Supremacy's sudden attack made him understand that the Dark Abyss was determined to kill him and Nian Nian!
He didn't think that the death of the Human Supremacy would make the Dark Abyss stop!
Not only would the Dark Abyss not stop, but it would also intensify!
Su Zhe hesitated for a moment and then said, "Little friend, why don't you come with us to the Ancient God Abyss?
Little friend, don't worry. If you go to the Ancient God Abyss, even if the Dark Abyss Master personally takes action, the Ancient God Abyss will protect you! "
Ye Xuan shook his head.
If he left this place, the entire Fifth Dimension would be completely destroyed!
The Fifth Dimension could not stop the Dark Abyss!
Su Zhe sighed softly when he saw that Ye Xuan didn't want to go to the Ancient God Abyss.
Ye Xuan wasn't willing to give up the Fifth Dimension, so he would always be in a passive position!
At this moment, Xuan Chu suddenly appeared in front of Ye Xuan. She looked at Ye Xuan and said, "Let me tell you some bad news. The Xuan Huan Sect from the Whirling World has sent people!"
Ye Xuan frowned slightly, "The Xuan Huan Sect?"
Xuan Chu nodded, "A super sect from the Whirling World!
They came this time for the Dao Scripture in your possession! "
Ye Xuan was silent. He hadn't expected the forces from the Whirling World to come so quickly!
Xuan Chu suddenly asked, "Who was that woman?"
Ye Xuan looked at Xuan Chu, "My aunt!"
Xuan Chu, "…"
Ye Xuan asked, "Miss Xuan Chu, how many people from the Xuan Huan Sect have come?"
Xuan Chu shook her head, "I don't know!
But we should know soon!
Because they should have already arrived! "
Ye Xuan nodded, "Thank you, Miss Xuan Chu, for telling me!"
After saying that, he turned around and left with Nian Nian.
Xuan Chu looked at Ye Xuan, not knowing what she was thinking.
Somewhere in the main hall.
Ye Xuan sat cross-legged on the ground and slowly closed his eyes!
If it wasn't for the help of the Nether World Hall, would he and Nian Nian have survived?
Of course not!
Moreover, he also discovered that powerhouses above the Enlightened Dao Realm could pose a threat to his Daoist Body!
Improve his Dao Body?
This thought flashed through Ye Xuan's mind, but he quickly rejected it.
Previously, he had relied on the gift from the Jia Long Dragon Clan to improve his Dao Body. Now, if he didn't have an opportunity, it would be impossible for him to improve his Dao Body!
Whether it was his realm or his body, he couldn't improve them for the time being.
After a while, Ye Xuan said softly, "It seems that I can only take it step by step!"
Ye Xuan no longer thought about improving his Dao Body. Instead, he began to stabilize his Dao Body.
(This chapter is not finished. Please continue.)
As Su Zhe had said, he hadn't even fully understood the Dao Controlling Realm. He really shouldn't think about the Dao Attainment Realm!
...
Somewhere in the starry sky, the Earthly Venerable Dark Abyss looked down at the Five-Dimensional Universe. Beside him was the Ancestral Master.
The Ancestral Master's expression was extremely solemn. He didn't expect the Human Venerable to die just like that!
And he died in the Mortal World!
What did this mean?
It meant that the other party wasn't suppressed by the Dark Dao Laws of the Mortal World!
The Earthly Venerable suddenly said, "Did you find out where that woman came from?"
The Ancestral Master shook his head. "I couldn't find out!"
The Earthly Venerable frowned slightly. "You couldn't find out?"
The Ancestral Master nodded. "She seemed to have appeared out of thin air!"
The Earthly Venerable was silent.
After a while, the Earthly Venerable looked down. "I have already informed the Celestial Venerable that he will rush here in three days!"
Hearing this, the Ancestral Master was shocked. "Is the Celestial Venerable going to make a move?"
The Earthly Venerable was expressionless. "The person behind Ye Xuan is more powerful than we thought!"
The Ancestral Master said in a low voice, "Besides that, there is also the Ancient God Abyss. They are determined to help Ye Xuan!"
The Earthly Venerable frowned. "What is their purpose in doing this?"
The Ancestral Master sighed softly. "The current situation is becoming more and more disadvantageous for us!"
The Earthly Venerable shook his head. "You are wrong!"
The Ancestral Master looked at the Earthly Venerable. The Earthly Venerable said softly, "As far as I know, many sects in the Whirling World have already sent people to the Five-Dimensional Universe!
And their goal is that Dao Scripture!
In other words, Ye Xuan's enemies will only increase!
We can wait and see for now. "
The Ancestral Master was about to speak when a shadow suddenly appeared in the distant sky above the Dao City. The next moment, a powerful aura suddenly enveloped the entire Dao City.
The Earthly Venerable chuckled. "Look, the experts of the Whirling World have arrived!
There's going to be a good show to watch! "
In the distant sky above the Dao City, Ye Xuan suddenly appeared in front of the shadow. The shadow gradually became solid. It was a middle-aged man.
The Dao Realm!
The middle-aged man looked at Ye Xuan. "You are Ye Xuan!"
Ye Xuan nodded. "Yes!"
The middle-aged man laughed. "Since ancient times, the treasures of heaven and earth belong to the strong. You are so weak, how can you have the nerve to occupy the six Dao Scriptures?"
Ye Xuan suddenly took out the six scrolls of the Dao Scripture. He placed them in front of himself and then looked at the middle-aged man. "Senior, you are right. How about this? Senior, lower your cultivation level and fight with me. If you win, I will give these six scrolls to you. What do you think?"
The middle-aged man laughed. "How interesting!
A Dao Manipulation Realm cultivator wants to challenge me? "
Ye Xuan looked at the middle-aged man. "I have fought with experts above the Dark Abyss Realm. They are very strong. I am no match for them!"
The middle-aged man shook his head. "No, no!
It is not that they are strong, but that you are too weak! "
Ye Xuan said in a low voice, "Senior, they are experts from the Dark Abyss!"
The middle-aged man chuckled. "Dark Abyss?
What kind of rubbish place is that?
How dare they compare to my Whirling World? "
On the other side, the Earthly Venerable was expressionless. No one knew what he was thinking.
The Ancestral Master's face was a little gloomy.
The middle-aged man suddenly said, "Fine, I will lower my realm and fight with you. You …"
At this moment, the Earthly Venerable's voice suddenly sounded in the sky. "Sir, although Ye Xuan is only at the Dao Manipulation Realm, his combat strength can kill those who have achieved the Dao!
Especially when he has a Divine Item Daoting … "
The middle-aged man looked at the Earthly Venerable in the sky and smiled. "You are from the Dark Abyss, right?"
The Earthly Venerable nodded. "Yes!
I am the Dark Abyss Human Venerable … "
The middle-aged man shook his head with a smile. "Do you know what it means to be a frog at the bottom of a well?"
The Earthly Venerable looked at the middle-aged man without saying a word.
The middle-aged man smiled. "Ye Xuan thinks that the experts from the Dark Abyss are strong because he is weak. He is a frog at the bottom of a well. He has not seen many Dao Attainment Realm cultivators, so he thinks that you are strong. You think that Ye Xuan is not weak because you are weak. An expert above the Dao Attainment Realm can't even kill a Dao Manipulation Realm youth … I can only say that you are useless!
Very, very useless! "
At this point, he shook his head with a smile. "To think that the Master of Dark Scripture was also a figure back then. Why are his descendants so useless?"
In the sky, the Earthly Venerable was silent.
Beside him, the Ancestral Master's face was frighteningly gloomy.
At this moment, the middle-aged man suddenly looked at the Earthly Venerable and said, "As far as I know, the Daoting has a Divine Item called the Seal of Dao. This item was the most precious treasure of the Daoting back then. You said that Ye Xuan has a Divine Item. Could it be this item?
If it is this item, I have to be careful! "
The Earthly Venerable looked at the middle-aged man calmly. "The Seal of Dao?
How could he have such a Divine Item?
The Divine Item I am talking about is the sword in his hand, not the Seal of Dao. Sir, you can rest assured. Go! "
Ye Xuan: "…"

Chapter 1423
Sword!
The middle-aged man looked at the Executing Heaven Sword in Ye Xuan's hand when he heard the Earthly Venerable. He shook his head and smiled. "While this sword isn't bad, that's all there is to it!"
As he spoke, he opened his palm and pressed it down lightly. In an instant, his realm was suppressed from the Dao Attainment Realm to the Dao Attainment Realm!
As if he'd thought of something, the middle-aged man looked up at the Earthly Venerable. "I'll show all of you what a true expert is!"
As he spoke, he pressed his right hand down once more. In an instant, he went from the Dao Attainment Realm to the Dao Attainment Realm!
In the sky, the Earthly Venerable shook his head after a moment of silence. "The world is vast and anything can happen!"
The Ancestral Master was speechless.
Below, the middle-aged man looked at Ye Xuan. "This isn't bullying you, right?"
Ye Xuan hesitated for a moment before he said, "Senior, do you dare to suppress it to the Dao Attainment Realm?"
The crowd was speechless.
The middle-aged man looked at Ye Xuan. "The Dao Attainment Realm?"
Ye Xuan nodded. "I don't mean anything else. I just want to see how strong experts above the Dao Attainment Realm are!
If senior can defeat me at the Dao Attainment Realm, then I, Ye Xuan, will truly be convinced! "
The middle-aged man chuckled. "Ye Xuan, do you think I'm stupid?"
Ye Xuan was speechless.
The middle-aged man smiled. "While I'm confident, I know that it's better to be safe than sorry!
It's better to be careful when you're outside.
So, are you going to fight or not? "
Ye Xuan nodded. "Yes!"
He vanished on the spot as soon as he finished speaking.
A strand of sword light tore through the battlefield!
It was a swift strike!
Originally, the middle-aged man had a hint of vigilance in his eyes. Although he was confident, as he said, he was still very cautious. However, when he saw Ye Xuan's sword, that trace of vigilance suddenly disappeared!
This sword was very fast, but to him, it was too weak!
The middle-aged man shook his head and smiled. "That's it?"
As he spoke, he blasted a punch forward!
At this moment, Ye Xuan's sword momentum suddenly changed. The originally ordinary sword became a Dao sword!
At this moment, the middle-aged man's expression changed drastically. Because at this moment, he sensed danger. Originally, he was about to attack, but he suddenly switched to defense. He crossed his arms and fiercely pushed them forward.
At the same time, he stopped suppressing his cultivation level. However, Ye Xuan's sword had already descended.
Boom!
In front of everyone's eyes, the middle-aged man was sent flying by Ye Xuan's sword. In the process, the middle-aged man's fleshly body crumbled inch by inch. When he reappeared 10,000 feet away, only his soul remained!
After Ye Xuan pushed the middle-aged man back, he immediately pointed his finger and the Soul Suppressing Sword suddenly flew out.
Right at this moment, the middle aged man's soul suddenly vanished into the horizon. At the same time, a furious shout resounded from the horizon. "Despicable!
Shameless!
Despicable!
Shameless!
I, Ye Jun, have never seen such a despicable and shameless person … "
Ye Xuan was speechless.
On the other side, Xuan Chu shook her head.
Beside her, the old man shook his head. "This Ye Jun is really a weirdo …"
Xuan Chu said softly, "The Dao scripture and martial arts civilization began in the Whirling World. From the beginning, when we faced the Five-Dimensional Universe, we had the mentality of being superior to others. Let alone the Five-Dimensional Universe, even when facing the Dark Abyss and Ancient God Abyss, we have the same mentality.
However, whether it is the Five-Dimensional Universe or the Dark Abyss, they are actually not weak. "
The old man was silent.
In fact, when facing Ye Xuan at the beginning, he did not pay too much attention to Ye Xuan!
At that time, in his heart, Ye Xuan was just not bad!
But now, it seemed that this Ye Xuan was not only not bad.
Not to mention the Five-Dimensional Universe, even if Ye Xuan was placed in the Whirling World,
(This chapter is not finished, please continue.)
But, he was definitely the top existence of the younger generation.
As if thinking of something, the old man shook his head and sighed. "This Young Master Ye … is too good at pretending to be a pig to eat a tiger!"
He still could not forget how Ye Xuan had shown weakness when they had just arrived!
A person's strength was not scary, what was scary was when he hid his strength!
At this moment, Xuan Chu suddenly said, "When will Master arrive?"
The old man said in a low voice, "In two days!"
Xuan Chu nodded slightly. She looked at Ye Xuan in the distance, thinking about something.
In the distance, Ye Xuan looked up at the Terrestrial Venerable, and the Terrestrial Venerable was also looking at Ye Xuan.
He had to admit that Ye Xuan's strength surprised him!
Although Ye Jun had suppressed his cultivation by two realms, his foundation was still there!
However, he still could not take a blow from Ye Xuan!
One could imagine that if Ye Xuan reached Enlightenment … he would definitely be invincible among his peers.
All along, the focus of the Dark Abyss had been on the forces behind Ye Xuan and the Ancient God Abyss, thus neglecting Ye Xuan himself!
In fact, Ye Xuan himself was also very scary.
This kind of person must be killed as an enemy!
Ye Xuan looked at the Terrestrial Venerable and smiled. "Do you want to know how the Human Venerable died?"
The Terrestrial Venerable narrowed his eyes. "Are you threatening me?"
Ye Xuan smiled and turned to leave.
In the sky, the Terrestrial Venerable stared at Ye Xuan.
How did the Human Venerable die?
In fact, the death of the Human Venerable was not scary. What was scary was that the Human Venerable died in the Mortal World!
What did this mean?
It meant that the woman who killed the Human Venerable was not suppressed by the Dark Way Law of the Mortal World!
An Abyss had met someone who could ignore the Dark Way Law of the Mortal World!
Situ Tingyun!
That woman had caused An Abyss to suffer great losses!
At this moment, a voice suddenly sounded beside him. "Nether World Hall!"
The Terrestrial Venerable turned to see a woman standing beside him. The woman wore a simple black dress. The black dress was as black as ink and exuded a sense of oppression.
Celestial Venerable!
The Ancestral Master hurriedly bowed. "Greetings, Celestial Venerable!"
The Celestial Venerable nodded. Beside her, the Terrestrial Venerable said, "Big Sister, you came early!"
The Celestial Venerable said softly, "Third Brother is dead!
How could I not come early? "
The Terrestrial Venerable was silent.
The Celestial Venerable looked at the Terrestrial Venerable. "You don't look sad at all!"
The Terrestrial Venerable shook her head. "There is no point in being sad!"
The Celestial Venerable smiled. "Indeed!"
Then, she looked down. "I have found out that the person who helped him is from a force called Nether World Hall in the Fourth Dimension!"
The Terrestrial Venerable frowned. "Nether World Hall?
Why have I never heard of it? "
The Celestial Venerable said softly, "A very ancient force and very mysterious!
They appeared in the Fourth Dimension, but for some reason, they disappeared. "
The Terrestrial Venerable said in a low voice, "Disappeared?
Did they leave? "
The Celestial Venerable nodded. "They left!
As for where they went, I don't know!
But for now, they are a very scary group of people! "
The Terrestrial Venerable asked, "Why do you think so?"
The Celestial Venerable looked at the Terrestrial Venerable. "Do you know why that woman disappeared after killing the Human Venerable?"
Without waiting for the Terrestrial Venerable to answer, the Celestial Venerable said, "Because what she came was just a clone!"
Clone!
The Terrestrial Venerable's pupils suddenly shrank. "This …"
The Celestial Venerable smiled. "A clone in the Mortal World ignored the Great Dao nomological laws left by Dark Ancestor and killed the Human Venerable. Don't you find it very unbelievable?"
The Terrestrial Venerable said in a low voice, "This is too scary!"
(This chapter is not finished. Please turn the page.)
The Celestial Venerable said softly, "There is something even scarier!"
The Terrestrial Venerable looked at the Celestial Venerable. "What?"
The Celestial Venerable looked down. "He encountered the Naga race. As far as I know, the last patriarch of the Naga race was suppressed in the Dark World by that person … I have been to the Dark World. That old patriarch has fallen, which means that the Almighty has taken action.
However, Ye Xuan left the Dark World with the granddaughter of the Naga race's old patriarch.
There are two possibilities. The first is that the Almighty let Ye Xuan and Naga go, which is basically impossible!
The second is … "
At this point, she did not continue!
The Terrestrial Venerable said in a low voice, "The second is that the person behind Ye Xuan protected Ye Xuan and Naga!"
The Celestial Venerable nodded. "Yes!
If someone really protected him … then we have to re-evaluate the strength of the force behind him! "
The Terrestrial Venerable suddenly asked, "Big Sister, do you know that plain-dressed woman?"
The Celestial Venerable was silent.
The Terrestrial Venerable frowned slightly. "Why?"
The Celestial Venerable said softly, "Mysterious!
And powerful! "
The Terrestrial Venerable asked, "How powerful?"
The Celestial Venerable laughed lightly. "Do you know why the Ancient God Abyss is so determined to help Ye Xuan?"
The Terrestrial Venerable said in a low voice, "Because of the plain-dressed woman?"
The Celestial Venerable nodded. "According to my investigation, the plain-dressed woman has been to the Ancient God Abyss. However, I do not know what happened there!
But what is certain is that the Ancient God Abyss is so determined to protect Ye Xuan. Even Su Zhe has come personally. This must have something to do with the plain-dressed woman!
And for the Ancient God Abyss to help Ye Xuan at all costs, either the plain-dressed woman has made a deal with them, or they want to form a good relationship with the plain-dressed woman … If it is the latter, it means that the plain-dressed woman's strength is beyond our imagination! "
The Terrestrial Venerable was silent, his expression solemn.
The Celestial Venerable said again, "There is one more thing. Ye Xuan has swallowed the blood of the Naga Dragon Clan. His body has the power of the Naga Dragon Clan!
The blood of the Naga Dragon Clan is unyielding and domineering. Not to mention among humans, even among the demonic beasts, it is at the top of the pyramid. However, Ye Xuan can swallow their blood!
What does this mean?
It means that the power of Ye Xuan's bloodline is above that of the Naga Dragon Clan. No, it should be far beyond the Naga Dragon Clan!
However, we know nothing about the origin of the power of his bloodline! "
The Terrestrial Venerable shook his head. "This person is too mysterious!"
The Celestial Venerable looked down at the Dao City. "Daoting Ancestor Zhao Zhiqing made him the Dao Master after meeting him!
There are two reasons. First, he took a fancy to him. Of course, he is indeed a rare genius!
But I don't think Zhao Zhiqing made him the Dao Master and gave him the Dao Seal just because of this. "
The Terrestrial Venerable said in a low voice, "The force behind him!"
The Celestial Venerable nodded. "It must be!
Apart from that, this person is also related to Situ Tingyun … There must be an extremely mysterious and powerful force behind him!
And these people might not belong to our world … "
The Terrestrial Venerable frowned slightly. "Do we have a chance of winning?"
The Celestial Venerable shook his head. "Judging from the strength displayed by Situ Tingyun and the woman from the Nether World Hall, we have no chance of winning!"
The Terrestrial Venerable said in a low voice, "Are we going to give up?"
The Celestial Venerable smiled. "No!"
The Terrestrial Venerable frowned slightly. "Why?"
The Celestial Venerable said softly, "Because he might summon the Spirit of the Great Path. We are destined to be enemies with him."
With that, she smiled slightly. "It's not that we have no chance of winning!
We have to play this game of chess well!
After all, there are too many people who want the Dao Scripture in his hands now!
It's true that I, An Yuan, don't have a great chance of winning if I fight him alone. But why should we fight him alone?
We can choose to fight him together, can't we? "

PS: One ticket is too few. Can we vote for a few more?

Chapter 1424
Ye Xuan returned to his room. In front of him was the Soul Quelling Sword!
The Soul Quelling Sword had not broken through, but she had reached a critical point!
If she had absorbed Ye Jun's soul, she would have broken through. Unfortunately, Ye Jun had escaped!
Ye Jun's escape also made Ye Xuan understand that experts above the Dao Attainment Realm were not so easy to kill.
After a long silence, Ye Xuan suddenly kept the Soul Quelling Sword and left.
As for Nian Nian, she was still in the Prison Pagoda!
It was too dangerous for her to be out there!
One must know that the person An Yuan was truly afraid of was not Ye Xuan, but Nian Nian!
Ye Xuan arrived in the starry sky of the Fifth Dimension. Su Zhe was in this starry sky.
Su Zhe did not leave with his people. If he did, the experts from An Yuan would definitely come out in full force. That was not something the Fifth Dimension could fight against.
Seeing Ye Xuan, Su Zhe smiled faintly. "Young friend, you managed to injure Ye Jun with a single strike. With such strength, not to mention the Fifth Dimension, even in the Whirling World, among the younger generation, you are considered a top existence."
Ye Xuan shook his head, "Senior must be joking!
I was able to injure Ye Jun because he underestimated me and lowered his realm. If not for that, I'm afraid I would not be his opponent! "
Su Zhe's eyes flashed with surprise. Ye Xuan had destroyed Ye Jun's body with a single strike, but he did not feel complacent. This surprised him!
Ye Xuan cupped his fists, "Thank you for your help, I, Ye Xuan, am eternally grateful."
Su Zhe collected his thoughts and smiled, "An Yuan's enemy is my Ancient God Abyss's friend!"
Ye Xuan hesitated, then said, "Senior has seen Qing'Er?"
The woman in the plain dress!
The smile on Su Zhe's face gradually disappeared. He nodded slightly, "Greetings, Senior."
Ye Xuan quickly asked, "Did she say anything?"
Su Zhe smiled bitterly.
When they first met that senior, she wanted to destroy the Ancient God Abyss because their strength threatened Ye Xuan …
Su Zhe shook his head and smiled. "Little friend, she didn't say anything else. She just asked us not to hurt you!"
Ye Xuan was speechless.
Su Zhe hesitated for a moment before asking, "Young friend, may I ask what is Senior's background?"
In fact, she had investigated Ye Xuan and the plain-dressed woman. She knew a lot about Ye Xuan, but she knew practically nothing about the plain-dressed woman.
Too mysterious!
What is Qing'er's background?
Ye Xuan shook his head and smiled. Actually, he didn't know either!
He only knew that her name was Qing'er and that she was his relative. Other than that, he knew nothing about her background.
Seeing that Ye Xuan didn't answer, Su Zhe didn't ask any further. Instead, he changed the topic. "Young friend, with Senior's strength, it shouldn't be difficult for her to destroy the Ancient God Abyss. Why is she …"
Ye Xuan sighed softly. "Senior, don't you understand?
She doesn't even care about the Ancient God Abyss! "
Hearing this, Su Zhe's face gradually became solemn!
That's right!
With Senior's strength, does she need to care about the Ancient God Abyss?
Just like an elephant, does it need to care about an ant?
At this moment, Ye Xuan asked again, "Senior, you should know about the Cause of Misfortune, right?"
Su Zhe nodded. Just as he was about to speak, he seemed to have thought of something. His pupils shrank abruptly. "Young friend, do you mean to say that she is blocking the Cause of Misfortune for you?"
Ye Xuan nodded.
Su Zhe's expression became incomparably solemn. "No wonder … no wonder you were able to survive until now … I see …"
Ye Xuan suddenly asked, "Senior, what is the realm above Dao Attainment?"
Su Zhe said in a low voice, "Unity!"
Ye Xuan frowned slightly. "Unity?"
Su Zhe nodded. "Unity of All Laws, Unity of All Daos!
Experts who have reached this level can unite all Laws and Daos in the world into one.
Currently, whether it is the Ancient God Abyss or the Ancient God Abyss, experts of this level are few and far between!
As for the Dao Attainment Realm, although there are many Dao Attainment Realm experts in the Ancient God Abyss, those who can truly attain Dao can be counted on one hand. "
Ye Xuan was a little puzzled. "Truly attain Dao Attainment Realm?"
Su Zhe nodded his head slightly. "Every realm is divided into true and false. Some Dao Attained Realm cultivators are not as strong as they used to be. Just like Ye Jun, he was not as strong as he used to be. It could be said that his true strength was not even 60% of the Dao Attained Realm!
If the other party is not as powerful, even if you suppress your realm, you may not be able to defeat him!
Just like you, even if you suppress your realm to the Dao Validation Realm, within the Dao Validation Realm, there are not many who can be your opponent! "
Ye Xuan nodded. "I understand!"
Su Zhe continued, "The Ancient God Abyss has three Venerables, the Heavenly Venerable, the Earthly Venerable, and the Human Venerable!
All three are at the Consolidation Realm, but the Heavenly Venerable is the most terrifying, because she is the kind of Consolidation that is not as powerful as before!
Other than that, the Ancient God Abyss also has the Yin Yang Gods. These two have reached the peak of the Consolidation Realm tens of thousands of years ago. As for now, I'm afraid they are unfathomable. "
As he spoke, he looked at Ye Xuan. "Young friend, I still want to advise you. Why don't you come with me to the Ancient God Abyss!
There, the Ancient God Abyss can protect you. If you are in the Fifth Dimension, the Ancient God Abyss will not be able to help you … "
Ye Xuan said in a low voice, "I appreciate senior's kindness!
But you know, if I leave here, the Ancient God Abyss will definitely threaten me with the Fifth Dimension. I will not give up on the Fifth Dimension! "
Su Zhe sighed softly. "But forgive me for being blunt, young friend, with your current strength, there is no way you can fight against the Ancient God Abyss. Unless Miss Nian Nian regains her memory, or the person behind young friend appears!"
Ye Xuan was silent.
When would Nian Nian regain her memory?
He did not know!
As for the Nether World Temple … the current Nether World Temple would not have time to care about him!
It could be said that he could only face everything by himself!
Ye Xuan collected his thoughts and looked at Su Zhe. "Senior, if I may be so bold as to ask a favor!"
Su Zhe nodded. "Young friend, please speak!"
Ye Xuan said in a low voice, "Senior, I want you to stay in the Fifth Dimension for three months!
I need three months! "
Su Zhe was silent.
Ye Xuan suddenly said, "If I meet Qing 'er in the future, if you have any questions or want to know, I can ask Qing' er on your behalf!"
Hearing this, Su Zhe's expression changed. He cupped his fists and said, "If that's the case, then this old man will thank you in advance!"
If he could ask the woman in the plain dress for advice, it would definitely be beneficial.
A pointer from that kind of expert was equivalent to ten thousand years of hard work!
Su Zhe continued, "Little friend, I will transfer twenty-six Dao Completion experts to the Fifth Dimension. Apart from this, I will personally invite my master to the Fifth Dimension just in case. With him here, even if the Heavenly Sovereign personally takes action, he will not be able to do anything to you!"
Ye Xuan cupped his fists and said, "Many thanks!"
Su Zhe smiled. "Young friend, this old man also has a favor to ask!"
Ye Xuan smiled. "Senior, please speak!"
Su Zhe became serious.
"If you really manage to gather all the Dao scriptures in the future, I hope that you can borrow my Ancient God's Abyss to take a look. Is that possible?"
Ye Xuan smiled. "Of course!"
Su Zhe smiled. "Thank you!"
After chatting with Su Zhe for a while, Ye Xuan turned around and left. Su Zhe also left the Fifth Dimension.
From the current situation, he knew that even he could not control this place!
Because not only was there the Dark Abyss, there was also the Whirling World!
It was really difficult!
In the starry sky, Su Zhe suddenly stopped in his tracks. Not far in front of him, stood a woman.
The Heavenly Venerables!
Su Zhe narrowed his eyes. "I didn't expect the Heavenly Venerables to personally come forward!"
The Heavenly Venerables laughed. "Su Zhe, in my impression, you are a cunning person. But this time, it doesn't seem worth it for you to help Ye Xuan!
That doesn't seem like your style! "
Su Zhe was expressionless. "The enemy of the Ancient God's Abyss is the friend of the Ancient God's Abyss!"
The Heavenly Venerables shook his head and laughed. "No!
If I'm not wrong, you are helping him because of the woman behind him! "
Su Zhe looked at the Heavenly Venerables and did not speak.
The Heavenly Venerables' lips curled up. "Su Zhe, I am really curious. How strong is the woman in the plain dress? How could the Ancient God's Abyss spare no effort to help Ye Xuan!"
Su Zhe laughed. "It seems that you are also investigating the … woman in the plain dress!"
He wanted to call him Senior, but after thinking about it, he decided not to!
Why should he let the Ancient God's Abyss know how strong the woman in the plain dress was?
Wouldn't it be better to let them do what they want?
The Heavenly Venerables looked at Su Zhe. "As far as I know, the Whirling Sect, Xuan Huan Sect, and the number one aristocratic family, the Xiao Clan, have all sent people to the Fifth Dimension!
In addition, the Whirling World's Xuanji Sect has already built a transmission array. Once the transmission array is completed, it will be much easier for the Whirling World to come to the Fifth Dimension!
When that time comes, do you know what Ye Xuan will face?
Oh yes, there is also the Ancient God's Abyss! "
Su Zhe was silent.
The Heavenly Venerables laughed. "Su Zhe, the Ancient God's Abyss is helping Ye Xuan. This is equivalent to making everyone your enemy."
Su Zhe laughed. "So what?"
The Heavenly Venerables looked at Su Zhe. After a moment of silence, she laughed. "It seems that the woman in the plain dress is stronger than I thought!
But do you think that she can deal with everyone? "
Su Zhe looked at the Heavenly Venerables and laughed. "Heavenly Venerables, since you have been persuading me for so long, I will also give you a word of advice!
Whether it is the Ancient God's Abyss or the Ancient God's Abyss, it has not been easy for us to survive until now!
The world itself is already very difficult, why do we still have to work hard?
Is the Dao Scripture really that important?
Is it not good to be alive? "
The Heavenly Venerables looked at Su Zhe. "How strong is she!"
Su Zhe was silent.
The Heavenly Venerables laughed. "Let me rephrase my question. If I were to fight with her, what percentage would I have?"
Su Zhe looked at the Heavenly Venerables. "You?"
The Heavenly Venerables nodded. "I should have some chance of winning, right?"
Su Zhe was silent for a moment before replying. "Let's make it three to seven!
You three, she seven! "
The Heavenly Venerables blinked. "Really?"
Su Zhe replied calmly, "I have never lied to anyone before!"
The Heavenly Venerables laughed. "I know!
Thank you for telling me! "
After saying that, she turned and disappeared into the horizon.
Su Zhe said softly, "The feeling of lying is so f * cking satisfying … No wonder Little Friend Ye likes to lie …"

Chapter 1425
The Five-Dimensional Universe.
Inside the Sword Hall, Ye Xuan sat cross-legged on the ground. In front of him was Jia Lou!
He was currently teaching Jia Lou the Dao Scripture Mantra!
Jia Lou also cultivated a Dao Body, but she did not cultivate the Dao Scripture Mantra. Now, he was teaching her the Dao Scripture Mantra without reservation!
Jia Lou's strength was the closest to the Dao Attainment Realm. If she cultivated the Dao Scripture Mantra, her strength would reach a terrifying level!
For now, even Ye Xuan could not compare to her. After all, she was a member of the Dragon Clan and had a unique advantage.
A moment later, Jia Lou stood up and looked at Ye Xuan. "Thank you!"
With that, she returned to the Prison Pagoda!
After a moment of silence, Ye Xuan stood up and left the hall. At this time, Ye Zhiming's voice sounded in his mind. "What plans do you have next?"
Ye Xuan chuckled. "What plans can I have?
I can only take one step at a time! "
Ye Zhiming said solemnly, "We must let Nian Nian recover her memory!"
Ye Xuan smiled bitterly. "I also want to, but you know Nian Nian's situation. She doesn't even know when she will recover her memory!"
After a moment of silence, Ye Zhiming said, "Do you still remember what your aunt said?"
Ye Xuan asked. "What did she say?"
Ye Zhiming said solemnly, "She said that she could not interfere with Nian Nian's matters. In other words, Nian Nian's memory loss … might have been intentional!"
Ye Xuan frowned slightly. "On purpose?"
Ye Zhiming said, "That's my guess!
But why did she lose her memory?
Is it because of the Five-Dimensional Universe?
But now that the Five-Dimensional Universe has recovered … "
Ye Xuan was silent.
In fact, he was also very puzzled. Why did Nian Nian lose her memory?
Did she not want to remember the past?
That shouldn't be the case!
At this time, a middle-aged man suddenly appeared in front of Ye Xuan!
The moment this middle-aged man appeared, Venerable Mi appeared behind Ye Xuan.
Ye Xuan looked at the middle-aged man. "From the Saha World?"
The middle-aged man smiled and said, "The Great Elder of the Profound Error Sect, Li Qiuheng!"
Ye Xuan said with a smile: "Sire must have come for the Dao Scripture!"
Li Qiuheng nodded. "Young Master Ye, before I came, An Yuan came looking for me. They wanted to cooperate with my Black Nebulous Sect, but I didn't agree immediately."
As he spoke, he looked at Ye Xuan and said with a smile, "Young master Ye, do you know why I didn't agree immediately?"
Ye Xuan shook his head, "I don't know!"
Li Qiuheng smiled and said, "Young master Ye, you are a smart person. You should understand that with your strength and the strength of the Fifth Dimension, it is impossible to protect those Dao Scriptures!
If that's the case, why don't you hand it over and keep it safe? "
Ye Xuan shook his head and smiled. "Sire, if I hand over the Dao Scripture, will you really let me go?"
Li Qiuheng looked at Ye Xuan. "If you are willing to hand it over, I can't guarantee anything else, but I can guarantee that my Black Nebulous Sect will not be your enemy!"
Ye Xuan was silent.
Li Qiuheng smiled and said, "I know that there is a powerful and mysterious force behind Young Master Ye!
However, Young Master Ye, do you really think that the people behind you can fight against the major sects of the Saha World and An Yuan at the same time? "
Ye Xuan didn't say anything.
Li Qiuheng shook his head and smiled. "Young Master Ye might not understand the Saha World. I can only tell you that any one of the top forces in the Saha World can easily destroy the entire Fifth Dimension!"
Ye Xuan thought about it and then said, "What Senior said makes sense!
This Dao Scripture is a disaster in the hands of me, Ye Xuan.
However, I am a bit unwilling to hand it over like this! "
Li Qiuheng smiled and said, "It is normal to be unwilling. However, although treasures are good, life is more important, isn't it?"
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "Senior, if I hand over the six Dao Scriptures to you, will I get any benefits?"
Li Qiuheng looked at Ye Xuan and said, "You still want benefits?"
Ye Xuan chuckled and said, "If there are no benefits, who wouldn't I hand it over to?
I don't necessarily have to hand it over to Senior, what do you think? "
Li Qiuheng pointed at Ye Xuan and smiled. "Greedy!
No, you want to use the Dao Scripture to stall for time and buy time for yourself!
Young Master Ye, do you really think that you can deal with our major forces?
You're thinking too simply of us!
We won't give you this opportunity!
Five days, if you don't hand over the Dao Scripture in five days, we will make you and the entire Fifth Dimension disappear from this world.
Of course, Young Master Ye can also hurry up and call for reinforcements … If you are late, it will be too late! "
After saying that, he turned around and left!
After taking a few steps, he suddenly stopped and turned to look at Ye Xuan and said, "I heard that the woman behind you is very strong?"
Ye Xuan looked at Li Qiuheng and Li Qiuheng smiled and said, "If you are pinning your hopes on her, then let me tell you.
Let me tell you, in the future, you will find out what a stupid idea this is! "
After saying that, he turned around and disappeared into the horizon.
Just as Li Qiuheng disappeared, Xuan Chu appeared in front of Ye Xuan.
Xuan Chu looked at Ye Xuan and said, "Don't mind it, the Whirling World is the birthplace of the Dao Scripture and martial arts civilization. The people there look at the people outside the universe like city people look at country people."
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "I don't mind it at all!
I am even a little happy! "
Xuan Chu looked at Ye Xuan and understood!
The more the Whirling World looked down on Ye Xuan, the happier Ye Xuan was!
Xuan Chu said in a deep voice, "What are your plans next?
As far as I know, the experts of the Xuanhuan Sect are already on their way, and there are many of them. In addition, the Xuanji Sect is also building a teleportation array … "
Speaking of this, she looked at Ye Xuan and said, "Originally, it was impossible for the Xuanji Sect to build a teleportation array that can lead to the Five-Dimensional Universe, because it is extremely difficult to come here from the Whirling World. Even the experts of the Consolidation Realm can't easily come to this world. However, because of the Dao Scripture, the major forces of the Whirling World have united like never before. Their goal is not only the Dao Scripture, but also your universe!"
Ye Xuan said in a deep voice, "Resources!"
Xuan Chu nodded and said, "If you want to develop, you must have resources!
And your universe is a good target for the Whirling World.
In addition, because of the Dao Scripture, the major forces of the Whirling World have helped the Xuanji Sect build a teleportation array. What the Whirling World is after is not just the Dao Scripture! "
Ye Xuan looked calm and did not speak. No one knew what he was thinking.
Xuan Chu looked at Ye Xuan and said, "The current situation is that even if you hand over the Dao Scripture, the Whirling World and the Dark Abyss will not let you go!
Your Five-Dimensional Universe, the Dao World, the Six-Dimensional Universe, the Daoting World, and the Celestial Abyss, especially those top-grade mineral veins, are all coveted by them.
Of course, the most important thing is the Dao Scripture. You have six Dao Scriptures, and in addition to the two from the Dark Abyss, you have a total of eight Dao Scriptures … They will go crazy! "
Ye Xuan said with a smile, "Xuan Chu, what are you trying to say?"
Xuan Chu said in a deep voice, "I want your six Dao Scriptures!
If you give them to me, I can help you! "
Ye Xuan said with a smile, "How can I help?"
Xuan Chu said, "As long as you give me the Dao Scripture, whether it is the Dark Abyss or the Whirling World, my Whirling Sect will help you deal with them!"
Ye Xuan looked at Xuan Chu and said, "The Whirling Sect is that strong?"
Xuan Chu nodded, "Yes!"
Ye Xuan said with a smile, "Xuan Chu, I trust you, but I don't trust the Whirling Sect. Do you understand what I mean?"
Xuan Chu frowned slightly, "Do you think I don't have the ability to make decisions?"
Ye Xuan nodded.
Xuan Chu's expression was calm, "If there are no accidents, I will be the next Whirling Sect Master!"
Ye Xuan shook his head, "Xuan Chu, you said it yourself!
If there are no accidents … Also, Miss Xuan Chu, I, Ye Xuan, will not put my fate in the hands of others. If I give you the Dao Scripture and you suddenly ignore me, won't I be embarrassed? "
Xuan Chu was silent.
Ye Xuan said with a smile, "Miss Xuan Chu, I appreciate your kindness!"
After saying that, he turned and left.
Xuan Chu looked at Ye Xuan in the distance and sighed softly.
At this time, an old man appeared beside her and said in a deep voice, "Heavenly Venerable An Yuan contacted us!
He asked if we are interested in joining forces! "
Xuan Chu shook her head, "I'm not interested!"
The old man frowned slightly, "Why?"
Xuan Chu spoke softly, "Because I feel that something bad will happen if they target Ye Xuan like this!"
The old man spoke in a low voice, "You're talking about the people behind him?"
Xuan Chu closed her eyes slowly, "So many people are bullying him, so those people definitely won't sit idly by …."
The old man hesitated for a moment before he said, "I know that the Blackout Sect, the Profound Secrets School, the Xiao Clan, and the Dao Return Institute have joined forces with An Yuan this time. Their true objective isn't just Ye Xuan himself, it's the people behind him as well!
If we don't participate now, then once Ye Xuan is defeated in the future, our Whirling Sect won't have a share in the Dao Scripture!
Moreover, we might even be isolated by these powers. So, now …. "
Xuan Chu suddenly looked at the old man, "Is this what the Sect Master wants?"
The old man shook his head, "The Sect Master wants you and Exalt Yue to make the decision!"
Xuan Chu spoke in a low voice, "When will Master arrive?"
The old man replied, "I don't know!"
Xuan Chu looked at the old man, and the old man spoke in a low voice, "Exalt Yue has already stopped contacting me … She might have already arrived in the Fifth Dimension …"
Xuan Chu fell silent.
The old man continued, "There's one more thing, and that is that the transmission array has already been completed under the alliance of several great powers.
The Dao Scripture is almost complete!
Once it's completed, a large number of super experts will rush over to the Fifth Dimension … At that time, Ye Xuan will … "
He didn't continue!
Xuan Chu spoke softly, "Their true objective is the people behind Ye Xuan and Mu Niannian …"
The old man nodded, "An Yuan will also send a large number of experts to the Fifth Dimension. They only have one goal, and that is to force the power behind Ye Xuan to show themselves!
Then, they will be destroyed! "
Xuan Chu looked down at the Fifth Dimension and spoke softly, "Will they show themselves to help Ye Xuan?"
The old man spoke in a low voice, "If they don't show themselves, Ye Xuan will definitely die!
The Fifth Dimension will definitely be destroyed! "
At this moment, the old man turned around. Behind them was a woman!
Senior Sister Lu!
The old man glanced at Senior Sister Lu, but didn't speak.
In fact, they already knew that Senior Sister Lu was here.
Xuan Chu looked at Senior Sister Lu, "Can you persuade Ye Xuan?"
Senior Sister Lu was expressionless, "Why should I persuade him?
Does he really think that the Yang family is easy to bully? "
After saying this, she turned around and left.
Xuan Chu frowned slightly, "Yang family?
What family? "
The old man shook his head, "Never heard of it!"
Xuan Chu was silent.
...
Spirit Palace.
On this day, Senior Sister Lu came to the Spirit Palace and found Ling 'er. She looked at Ling' er, "You can contact that little white fellow, right?"
Ling 'er nodded.
Senior Sister Lu was expressionless, "Contact her!"
Ling 'er hesitated for a moment, then opened a box …
Somewhere in the distant starry sky, the little white thing next to the azure-robed man suddenly stopped. She hurried to open a box. A moment later, she suddenly lifted her head to look at Ye Xuan. Then she waved her little paw quickly!
The green-robed man was silent.
Beside him, the spear-wielding woman looked at the green-robed man, "If you don't care, I will go back!"
The green-robed man shook his head, "It's too late!
We are too far away from him!
Unless we shatter the starry sky!
Even if we shatter the starry sky, it will still take a month! "
The spear-wielding woman raised her eyebrows slightly, "So what?"
The green-robed man held the spear-wielding woman's hand and said softly, "I will inform a few people!"
As his voice fell, he opened his palm, and a ray of sword light suddenly shot up into the sky. The next moment, the ray of sword light split into several rays of sword aura and disappeared in the starry sky.
...
On the peak of an unknown mountain, a woman sat cross-legged on a boulder. Suddenly, she opened her eyes. In the sky in front of her, the space was torn apart by a ray of sword aura!
The woman opened her right hand, and the ray of sword aura fell into her hand. When she saw the sword aura, the woman looked excited, "You finally contacted me!"
As she said this, she frowned slightly, "The Five-Dimensional Universe?
The Dark Abyss?
I should have killed all these pieces of trash back then! "
As soon as she finished speaking, she suddenly drew her sword and slashed forward. With this slash, the space in front of her split open. In the next moment, she turned into a ray of sword light and entered the pitch-black space. Soon after, a ray of sword light tore through the pitch-black space tunnel …
...
On the other side, in an unknown galaxy, a woman slowly walked in a resplendent galaxy. The starry sky around her was dazzling, mysterious, and beautiful.
This woman wore a white robe, and there was a wine gourd hanging on her waist.
At this moment, the woman suddenly stopped. Not far in front of her, there was a black door floating in the air.
The woman said softly, "The Cause of Disaster … Brother, was it forced on you by others, or is it your own … I will investigate clearly …"
As she said this, she walked towards the black door floating in the air.
At this moment, a ray of sword aura suddenly appeared not far behind her. The woman turned around and opened her palm. The ray of sword aura fell into her palm. A moment later, the woman's expression suddenly became ferocious, "Bandit Yang, if anything happens to him, I will fuse with that woman and blow your dog head off!"
After saying that, she suddenly threw a punch in front of her.
Boom!
Under this punch, the starry sky was destroyed, and nothing existed.
The next moment, a ray of white light tore through the pitch-black space …
...
This was an unknown starry sky. In the starry sky, there was a stone staircase that was millions of feet long.
The stone staircase stood in the starry sky, and at the end of the stone staircase, there was a huge stone door.
On the stone staircase, a Swordsman wearing a cloud white robe walked slowly …
....
PS: The college entrance examination is over.
Tomorrow will be early!
One vote is also love!







Chapter 1426
Around them, the starry sky was deathly silent.
On the stone steps, Swordsman was walking slowly and calmly.
At the bottom of the stone steps, there was a sloppily dressed old man. The old man's hair was long and messy, and at his waist, there was a small black wine pot.
At this moment, this sloppy old man was staring at the Swordsman on the stone steps.
The stone steps were nine hundred and ninety thousand zhang in total, one zhang was a Dao Law, one zhang was a Heaven and Earth, one zhang was a whirling wind …
The stone steps were the road, and the stone door at the end was the legendary Dao Gate!
What was the Dao Gate?
According to legend, it was an inheritance left behind by the Dao Scripture's owner. Once you enter the Dao Gate, you can obtain the Dao.
After the Dao Scripture's owner, no one had ever reached the Dao Gate.
Even the four disciples of the Dao Scripture's owner did not. Not only that, they did not even reach half the distance.
At this moment, Swordsman was only ten thousand zhang away from the Dao Gate.
At this time, the Swordsman suddenly sped up!
He walked faster and faster!
The Dao Law on the Dao Path did not seem to have any effect on him!
Seeing the Swordsman suddenly speed up, the sloppy old man's pupils shrank, his eyes filled with disbelief.
Soon, the Swordsman arrived in front of the Dao Gate.
The stone door slowly opened, and a voice floated out from inside. "Enter this door, and you can obtain the Dao."
The Swordsman chuckled. "Dao?
Can you block my sword? "
With that, he turned around and floated away.
The stone door was empty and quiet.
When the Swordsman returned to the starting point, the sloppy old man suddenly said with a trembling voice: "Your excellency … why don't you go in and see?
You can obtain the true Dao by entering this door! "
The Swordsman did not look back. "I am already invincible, why would I need to enter the Dao?"
The sloppy old man was petrified.
At this time, the starry sky several hundred zhang in front of the Swordsman suddenly split open, and a strand of sword qi floated out.
The Swordsman opened his palm, and the strand of sword qi steadily fell in front of him.
A moment later, the Swordsman looked up into the distance and whispered: "The Five Dimensional Universe?"
At this point, he turned to look at the sloppy old man. "Can you do me a small favor?"
The sloppy old man hurriedly said, "Senior, please speak!"
Senior!
In fact, the sloppy old man felt rather complicated. How many years had it been?
When had he ever called anyone senior?
Swordsman smiled faintly. "The son of an old friend has encountered some trouble in the Fifth Dimension. The people there are too weak, so I have no interest in going there. However, the son of an old friend is in trouble, so I have no choice but to help, so …"
The slovenly old man hurriedly said, "This junior is willing to go and help!"
This was a great opportunity to form a good relationship!
Why would such an expert seek his help?
Such an opportunity was hard to come by even in ten thousand years!
Swordsman nodded. "Since you've done me a favor, I should also do you a favor. Tell me!"
The sloppy old man hurriedly bowed respectfully, "Senior, please give me some pointers!"
Swordsman shook his head. "I can't guide you!"
The sloppy old man was puzzled. "Why?"
Swordsman chuckled. "You are within the realm, but I am not!"
The sloppy old man was stunned. "Not within the realm?"
Swordsman nodded. "I don't have a realm!"
The sloppy old man: "…"
Swordsman suddenly walked into the distance. "The Dao is in the heart, and you are the Dao. There is no need to become someone else's Dao. Since you have reached the end of the road, why not try another one?"
As he spoke, he had already disappeared at the end of the starry sky. At the same time, a voice came from the end of the starry sky. "Actually, there is nothing wrong with being weak. At least, you can taste the taste of defeat …"
At the stone steps, the sloppy old man was silent. After a long time, he respectfully bowed towards the distance. "Thank you for your guidance!"
As he said this, he turned to look at the stone door with a complicated expression. "Master, I finally know why you are disappointed in us!
It turns out that you don't want us to follow your path … "
After saying this, he turned and left.
...
Qingcheng.
On this day, a woman arrived at Qingcheng. The woman wore a long white dress and was as beautiful as a fairy. As soon as she stepped into Qingcheng, she attracted the attention of countless people around her.
Although many people around her had lustful thoughts, no one dared to offend her.
The woman slowly arrived at the Ye Family.
At this time, the Ye Family had already declined. There were only a few people left in the entire Ye Family.
The woman walked towards the Ye Family. At this time, a Ye Family guard blocked in front of the woman. He glanced at the woman. "You are?"
The woman smiled faintly, and in the next moment, she had already disappeared. The guard was stunned.
When the woman reappeared, she was already in the Ye Residence. To be precise, she was in the small courtyard where Ye Xuan and Ye Ling used to live.
The woman looked around and smiled. "Ye Xuan …"
At this time, a weak voice sounded behind the woman. "You are?"
The woman turned around. In front of her stood an extremely weak old man.
The woman looked at the old man and did not speak.
The old man said with a trembling voice, "Do you know Ye Xuan?"
The woman nodded. "I do!"
The old man hurriedly asked, "Is he dead?"
The woman shook her head. "No!"
The old man was stunned. Then, he fell to the ground. "He's not dead yet …"
The woman looked at the old man. "You're going to die!"
The old man smiled miserably. "I know …"
The woman smiled. "You want him to die?
Why is that? "
The old man's expression suddenly became resentful. "He killed my grandson and caused me to become like this. Do you think I shouldn't want him to die?"
The woman shook her head and smiled. "So it's you. I heard that you forced him to leave the Ye Family …"
The old man stared at the woman. "He was never a member of the Ye Family!"
The woman smiled. "In your heart, you think that your grandson and the Ye Family Patriarch's position are the most important. But do you know that your so-called Patriarch's position is nothing in his eyes?
He was born in your Ye Family. In fact, it was a great opportunity for your Ye Family. If you had used this opportunity well, I believe that the fate of your Ye Family would have been changed!
Unfortunately, you forcibly turned this opportunity into an ill-fated relationship! "
The old man looked at the woman. "What level has he reached now?
Has he reached the Dharma Realm? "
The woman blinked. "Dharma Realm?"
The old man stared at the woman. "I heard that the strongest in the entire Azure Province is the Dharma Realm!
Has he reached the Dharma Realm? "
The woman smiled. "He's probably tens of thousands of times stronger than the Dharma Realm!
With his current strength, he should be able to destroy your Azure Province with a sneeze! "
Hearing this, the old man was stunned. Then, as if he had gone mad, he said, "Impossible … He can't be that strong …"
The woman ignored the old man. She turned around and looked around. Then, she said softly, "This small place can't cultivate someone like him …"
With that, she slowly closed her eyes. Soon, the surrounding space trembled.
Seeing this, the old man's expression changed. He quickly retreated. "You …"
At this moment, the woman suddenly opened her eyes. She narrowed her eyes. "I can't find out … What kind of force is behind you …"
A moment later, the woman turned around and left.
Behind her, the old man said in a trembling voice, "Who, who are you!"
The woman smiled. "I come from the Whirling World. Hmm, you probably haven't heard of it.
This time, I came to the Ye family to see his past and then to see the woman behind him. Unfortunately, she didn't leave any information.
However, it's not like I didn't gain anything! "
After saying that, she disappeared.
"Whirling World?"
In the field, the old man's eyes were filled with confusion. What was that place?
...
The Five-Dimensional Universe.
Somewhere in the starry sky, the Celestial Venerable stood quietly. Behind her were the Master and the Earth Venerable.
On the right of the Celestial Venerable stood a middle-aged man. He was Li Qiuheng of the Xuanhuan Sect.
Opposite Li Qiuheng was a middle-aged man. This person was Ye Jun, whose body had been destroyed by Ye Xuan.
At this moment, an old man suddenly appeared in front of everyone.
Li Qiuheng glanced at the old man and smiled. "So it's Elder Hu Bugui of the Dao Returning Academy."
The old man called Hu Bugui said indifferently, "I heard that you're preparing to join forces to deal with the force behind Ye Xuan?"
The Celestial Venerable smiled. "Yes!"
Hu Bugui looked at the Celestial Venerable. "Count the Dao Returning Academy in!"
The Celestial Venerable smiled. "Welcome!"
Li Qiuheng suddenly looked at the Celestial Venerable. "Celestial Venerable, is the force behind Ye Xuan really that strong?"
The Celestial Venerable said softly, "Everyone, there was a woman who appeared to help Ye Xuan before, and she killed my third brother in the Dark Abyss Forbidden Area. My third brother is also at the Consolidation Realm, and the other party is only a clone!"
Hearing this, everyone's expressions became solemn.
A clone!
A clone had killed a Consolidation Realm expert!
The Celestial Venerable continued, "Also, you should already know that Ye Xuan has the Calamity Cause, but he's still alive. If I'm not wrong, someone must be blocking the Calamity Cause for him!"
In the distance, Hu Bugui frowned. "What kind of force is it?"
The Celestial Venerable shook his head. "I don't know, but I'm sure that it's definitely a very strong force!"
"Very strong?"
Hu Bugui sneered. "Isn't that a little exaggerated?"
The Celestial Venerable looked at Hu Bugui and smiled. "Can you kill a Consolidation Realm expert with a clone?"
Hu Bugui fell silent.
He couldn't!
Hu Bugui looked at the Celestial Venerable. "But I don't think there are many experts of that level!"
The Celestial Venerable asked, "What if there are many?"
Hu Bugui frowned. "How is that possible? Even in the Whirling World, there aren't many experts of that level …"
The Celestial Venerable smiled. "What if there are many?"
At this moment, Li Qiuheng suddenly said, "The Celestial Venerable is right, what if there are many?
Even if there aren't many, what if there are two or three? "
Hu Bugui fell silent.
The Celestial Venerable smiled. "I, An Yuan, suffered a great loss because I underestimated him!"
As she said this, she looked down and said softly, "Everyone, if we want to destroy Ye Xuan and obtain the Dao Scripture, we must first take care of the people behind him.
So, this time, everyone, don't hide it anymore!
Call as many experts as you can! "
Hu Bugui frowned. "If we call too many experts, what if the people behind him are afraid and don't show up? Wouldn't it be a loss?"
The Celestial Venerable said softly, "That's true …"
....







Chapter 1427
In the starry sky, Li Qiuheng said, "We can do this, call more experts, but let the Consolidation Realm experts hide in the dark. Once the people behind Ye Xuan appear, we can annihilate them in one fell swoop!"
As he spoke, he glanced at the crowd. "What do you think?"
Li Qiuheng smiled and said, "That's fine!"
As he spoke, he looked at the Celestial Venerate. "Celestial Venerate, what do you think?"
After a moment of silence, the Empyrean said, "I feel that we shouldn't underestimate the people behind him. It's better to be safe than sorry."
Li Qiuheng smiled and said, "I know Sky Sovereign's concerns. Therefore, just in case, my Black Illusion Sect will send six peak Consolidation Realm experts and twenty Dao Attainment Realm experts to the Fifth Dimension!"
Hu Bugui added, "The Dao Returning Academy will also send six peak Unity realm experts and twenty Dao Attainment realm experts!"
As he spoke, he looked at Ye Jun.
After a moment of silence, Ye Jun said, "I'll withdraw!"
Quit?
Everyone looked at Ye Jun.
Ye Jun said indifferently, "Everyone, my Ye Family isn't as strong as you all, so we won't get involved!"
With that, he turned around and left.
Although the Ye Family was not considered weak in the Whirling World, it was not particularly strong either!
He had initially sought out Ye Xuan because he didn't know Ye Xuan's background. However, after hearing the Heavenly Venerate's words, he realized that Ye Xuan wasn't as simple as he seemed!
Even the Dark Abyss needed to join forces with the Whirling World. One could imagine how powerful the force behind Ye Xuan was!
At this time, if the Ye Clan still wanted to participate, it would be very stupid.
Moreover, even if he won in the end.
The Ye Family would not benefit at all, because the Ye Family was much weaker than the other forces!
Therefore, no matter if they won or lost, the Ye Family would not benefit from it!
Leaving was the best choice!
As for the grudge of having his body severed by Ye Xuan … He no longer cared!
It was good enough that he was alive!
The others didn't say anything when they saw Ye Jun leave, nor did they try to persuade him to leave.
The Ye Family's strength was indeed nothing to them.
Meanwhile, Li Qiuheng suddenly said, "What's the attitude of the Whirling Sect?"
The Whirling Sect!
Everyone looked at the Heavenly Exalt when they heard this.
The Whirling Sect's attitude was extremely important because the Whirling Sect was known as the number one sect in the Whirling World!
After all, the Whirling Sect possessed the last Dao Scripture. Yet, it was still standing. Just this alone was sufficient to prove how powerful the Whirling Sect was!
The Empyrean said softly, "Their attitude is unclear!
However, we can be sure that even if they don't help us, they will definitely not help Ye Xuan! "
Li Qiuheng nodded. "Although the Whirling Sect is strong, they will definitely not go against all of us just for Ye Xuan!
However, we have to be careful. If they really help Ye Xuan, then the matter will be slightly troublesome! "
The Empyrean nodded. "I'll go see them again and probe their attitude!"
After that, she looked at Li Qiuheng. "When will Profound Theory Sect's teleportation array be completed?"
Li Qiuheng said solemnly, "Five days at most!"
Five days!
The Heavenly Exalt nodded and said, "The Xiao Clan also participated in the construction of the teleportation formation, right?"
Li Qiuheng nodded. "Not only the Xiao Clan, but the Whirling Sect also participated!"
The Empyrean smiled. "It seems that you are very ambitious."
Li Qiuheng smiled. "Since we're here, we naturally can't just bring along the Dao Scripture.
What do you say, Empyrean? "
The Empyrean smiled. "Of course!
You guys chat. I'll go see the two from the Whirling Sect and see what their attitude is! "
After that, she left with the Earth Venerable and the Deceased Master.
Li Qiuheng looked at the Fifth Dimension below. "Let's get ready!"
After that, everyone left. The starry sky became quiet.
...
Dao City, inside the Sword Hall.
Ye Xuan and Guan Yin sat opposite each other.
Venerable Mi was also beside Ye Xuan.
Ye Xuan suddenly looked at Venerable Mi. "Are there many people coming recently?"
Venerable Mi nodded. "In the Fifth Dimension, more and more mysterious experts are appearing!
Most of them are from the Whirling World! "
After that, he paused. "We must think of a countermeasure!"
Ye Xuan nodded. "I know!"
After that, he looked at Guan Yin. "What's the overall situation in the Fifth Dimension?"
Guan Yin said in a low voice, "There are no problems internally!
But … if the Whirling World and the Dark Abyss really join forces, then we … "
Ye Xuan was silent.
Guan Yin said again, "No matter what, we cannot fight in the Fifth Dimension. Otherwise, it will cause a destructive blow to the Fifth Dimension!"
Venerable Mi sighed. "Their goal is the Fifth Dimension. Therefore, they will definitely not place the battlefield elsewhere. Moreover, we are very passive."
After that, he looked at Ye Xuan. "Sect Master, I feel that even if the Ancient God Abyss helps us, we have no chance of winning. Moreover, if they pay too high a price, they will most likely withdraw!"
Ye Xuan nodded. "This time, we can only rely on ourselves."
Venerable Mi wanted to say something but stopped.
Ye Xuan said softly, "Based on the current situation, we have no chance of winning!
Am I right? "
Venerable Mi said in a low voice, "Unless Miss Nian Nian regains her memory!"
Nian Nian!
Guan Yin and Ye Xuan looked at Ye Xuan. The only thing that could save the Fifth Dimension now was Nian Nian.
As long as Nian Nian regained her memory, all the problems would be solved.
But the problem was that Nian Nian showed no signs of recovering!
Ye Xuan suddenly stood up and left. Inside the hall, Venerable Mi and Guan Yin looked at each other.
Ye Xuan came to the starry sky and looked down at the Fifth Dimension.
This was the place that Ye Xuan wanted to protect!
But now, with the Whirling World and the Dark World joining forces, could he still protect this universe?
As if thinking of something, he opened his palm and six scrolls of Dao Scripture appeared in his hand.
Ye Zhiming suddenly said, "What's your plan?
Hand it over? "
Ye Xuan shook his head. "It's useless to hand it over. Because their goal is not only the Dao Scripture, but also this universe."
Ye Zhiming said in a low voice, "Compared to the Whirling World, the Fifth Dimension and the Daoting are too weak.
As for the Ancient God Abyss, as Venerable Mi said, if they pay too much, they will most likely retreat! "
Ye Xuan was silent.
Ye Zhiming said again, "Do you want to use this Dao Scripture to make them kill each other?"
Ye Xuan shook his head. "Impossible!
Those people are not stupid. If I do that, I will only give away the Dao Scripture for nothing! "
Ye Zhiming said, "Whirling School?"
Ye Xuan still shook his head. "The Whirling Sect is powerful, but they only want my Taoist scripture. They won't really help me. Even if they help me, they will only help me. They won't help the entire Five-Dimensional Universe!
They will even give up the Fifth Dimension to ease the relationship with other forces … In short, they will not rely on others. "
Ye Zhiming said in a low voice, "Can you contact the woman in the plain dress?"
Ye Xuan raised his head and looked into the depths of the starry sky. He could not sense the woman at all!
Ye Zhiming said in a low voice, "This time is not like before. If the difference in strength between us is too great, the Fifth Dimension might become chaotic."
Ye Xuan nodded. This was also the problem he was most worried about!
If the Whirling World and the Dark World joined hands, the Fifth Dimension would not be able to resist!
In this situation, many experts in the Fifth Dimension might collapse.
But this was normal, because the difference in strength between the two sides was too great.
Ye Zhiming said, "What are your plans?"
Ye Xuan was silent. After a while, he looked at the Dao Scripture in his hand. This Dao Scripture was a hot potato!
Actually, if it was only because of the Dao Scripture, it would be easy to deal with. But the problem was not only the Dao Scripture. The Whirling World built the teleportation array to invade this universe and take it for themselves!
As if he thought of something, Ye Xuan squinted his eyes. "Teleportation array!"
Ye Zhiming said solemnly, "If the teleportation array can't be built, then the Whirling World won't pose much of a threat to us. If there is only Dark Abyss, then Ancient God Abyss won't have to sacrifice too much and the situation will become advantageous to us.
Of course, the prerequisite is to stop them from building the teleportation array! "
Ye Xuan suddenly kept the Dao Scripture and came to Seven's room. Ye Xuan said solemnly, "Seven, I want you to help me find someone!"
Seven looked at Ye Xuan, "Who!"
Ye Xuan said a few words and moments later, Seven got up and left. "Hold on until I return!"
After saying that, she turned into a streak of sword light and disappeared.
At the entrance of the room, Ye Xuan raised his head and looked at the sky, "I will try my best!"
After saying that, he disappeared.
Soon, Ye Xuan found Xuan Chu because he had to ask Xuan Chu to know the coordinates of the teleportation array built by Xuanji Sect.
Xuan Chu looked at Ye Xuan, "You want to destroy the teleportation array!"
Ye Xuan nodded.
Xuan Chu shook his head, "Impossible!
That teleportation array was built by a few major forces … Moreover, my Whirling Sect also participated in it. It's definitely not something you can destroy! "
Ye Xuan smiled, "I still want to try!"
Xuan Chu fell silent.
Ye Xuan asked again, "Can I?"
After a moment of silence, Xuan Chu said, "It's in the starry sky 120 thousand li south of here. That's the coordinates chosen by Xuanji Sect. They didn't expect you to destroy the teleportation array, so you can try."
Ye Xuan cupped his fists, "Thank you!"
After saying that, he got up and was about to leave.
Xuan Chu suddenly said, "Even if you destroy the teleportation array, you'll only buy some time!
And they won't give up! "
Ye Xuan said softly, "All I need is some time!"
As soon as he finished speaking, he vanished.
Xuan Chu frowned slightly, "What did he mean?"
Ye Xuan didn't swagger off. Instead, he left Dao City stealthily and arrived at a starry sky according to Xuan Chu's directions.
This starry sky was the teleportation coordinates chosen by Xuanji Sect.
Ye Xuan slowly closed his eyes, and it didn't take long for the Spatial Dao Law to appear between his brows. A short while later, Ye Xuan suddenly opened his eyes and looked into the distance. The space there was 300m away was the coordinates chosen by Xuanji Sect because he'd sensed a mysterious force there!
Ye Xuan was about to attack when a voice resounded from behind him, "If you dare to attack, you'll die right now!"
.....







Chapter 1428
Ye Xuan turned around. In front of him stood a woman.
She was dressed in a spotless white dress.
The woman smiled, "I am Xuan Chu's master!"
Xuan Chu's master!
Ye Xuan looked at the woman, "Whirling Sect!"
The woman nodded, "Yes!
You can call me Yue Zun. They all call me that! "
Ye Xuan was silent.
The woman smiled, "Don't worry. I have no ill intentions towards you. Whirling Sect will not ally with An Yuan."
Ye Xuan looked at the woman, "Why?"
The woman smiled, "There are two reasons. First, I am good friends with the ancestor of Daoting, Zhao Zhiqing.
As for the second reason, I can't tell you for now! "
Ye Xuan smiled, "Don't you want the Dao Scripture?"
Yue Zun said, "We want it, but we won't snatch it from you!"
Ye Xuan looked at Yue Zun, "Why?"
Yue Zun smiled, "I won't answer this question!"
As she spoke, she looked at the space a hundred zhang in front of Ye Xuan, "Do you really think you can destroy this teleportation array?"
Ye Xuan said in a deep voice, "Sir, please give me some pointers!"
Yue Zun smiled, "In that space, there are at least five Consolidation Realm experts protecting the array. If you go in, do you think you can fight against five Consolidation Realm experts?"
Ye Xuan shook his head, "I can't!"
Yue Zun walked in front of Ye Xuan and looked at Ye Xuan, "Now, you have two choices. First, take the Fifth Dimension Tendo and run as far as you can. If you want to escape, with the help of Ancient God Abyss, they might not be able to catch you!
Second, hand over the Dao Scripture! "
Ye Xuan smiled, "Give it to Whirling Sect?"
Yue Zun nodded, "If you give it to my Whirling Sect, I can promise you that my Whirling Sect will protect your Fifth Dimension."
Ye Xuan shook his head, "I don't believe you!"
Venerable Yue smiled, "Why?"
Ye Xuan looked at Yue Zun, "Are you the Sect Leader of Whirling Sect?"
Yue Zun shook his head, "No, but the Whirling Sect's Sect Leader is my Senior Sister. Normally, she would not go back on her word!"
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "Average?"
Venerable Yue smiled and said, "Then do you have a better choice?"
Ye Xuan looked at Yue Zun, "Miss Yue, I can choose to die together with you."
As soon as he finished speaking, he turned around and transformed into a streak of sword light that vanished into the horizon.
Indiscriminate destruction!
Yue Zun spoke softly, "Would you do that?"
Right at this moment, the space before her suddenly started trembling. Yue Zun frowned slightly when he witnessed this scene, "So quickly?
Looks like he can't wait any longer! "
...
Ye Xuan returned to the Fifth Dimension. He looked at the world below him in silence.
Passive!
The current situation in the Fifth Dimension was too passive!
Although the Ancient God Abyss had agreed to help, he knew that if the price was too high, the Ancient God Abyss would definitely retreat!
Because it was impossible for the Ancient God Abyss to become enemies with so many forces!
Currently, if the Ancient God Abyss retreated, the Fifth Dimension would not be able to fight back!
Why did the Whirling World and the Ancient God Abyss join hands?
It was because they wanted to deal with the forces behind him!
However, he was aggrieved because he did not know what forces were behind him!
What forces were behind him?
Ye Xuan was also a little confused.
He only knew of Qing 'er. As for the others, he wasn't familiar with them, including the aunt from the Nether World Hall who had come earlier!
Thinking of this, Ye Xuan sighed softly. Why did he feel like a scapegoat?
At this moment, a woman suddenly appeared in front of Ye Xuan. It was the Sky Sovereign.
The Sky Sovereign looked at Ye Xuan and said with a smile, "You are very calm!
If I'm not wrong, you must have contacted the people behind you.
Am I right? "
Ye Xuan was silent. He wanted to curse!
Contact?
I will contact your mother!
Qingcheng, Ye Clan, Ancestral Hall.
"Ancestors, Ye Xuan has no talent, no virtue … From now on, Ye Xuan's position as Crown Prince will be replaced by Ye Lang."
The one who spoke was an old man wearing a black robe.
Not far behind the old man stood a youth with a faint smile on his face.
This person was Ye Lang.
On both sides were the Ye Clan's Elders.
"Why!"
At this moment, a timid voice suddenly rang out in the ancestral hall.
Everyone turned to look and saw a little girl standing at the door. She was about 12 or 13 years old, and her hands were tightly gripping the hem of her skirt. Her face had a sickly pallor, and she looked a little weak. There was even a trace of fear in her eyes.
This little girl was called Ye Ling, Ye Xuan's sister. When she heard that the clan wanted to remove Ye Xuan, she rushed over despite her illness.
The black-robed old man frowned, "Ye Ling, what are you doing!"
The little girl called Ye Ling bowed to the people in the ancestral hall and said timidly, "Great Elder, my brother Ye Xuan is a Crown Prince. Why did you discard him for no reason?"
The Great Elder looked at Ye Ling coldly, "This is a matter of the clan. Why are you interrupting?
Leave! "
Ye Ling was afraid and didn't dare to look at the Great Elder, but she didn't leave. Instead, she plucked up her courage and walked into the ancestral hall. She bowed again to the Elders on both sides, "Elders, my brother is fighting with the Li Clan for the mining rights in Nanshan. He's fighting for the clan, and we don't know if he's dead or alive. But the clan is using a groundless excuse to discard his position. This is really unfair."
"Impudent!"
The Great Elder suddenly said angrily, "It's not up to a little girl like you to decide whether to discard him or not.
Men, drag her away. "
At this moment, the new Crown Prince Ye Lang suddenly smiled and said, "She should be flogged thirty times as a warning to others!"
The Great Elder said coldly, "Then flog her thirty times!"
Soon, two guards of the Ye Clan rushed in.
Ye Ling clenched her fists and said angrily, "This is unfair. My brother has risked his life for the clan for so many years. Even now, he's fighting for the clan. The clan is so unfair to him …"
One of the guards glanced at the new Crown Prince Ye Lang. He knew it was his chance to show off.
The guard sneered, "Young Master Ye Lang inherits the position of Crown Prince. Why are you shouting?" As he said this, he raised his hand and slapped Ye Ling's face.
Slap!
A crisp slap sounded. The right side of Ye Ling's face instantly turned red and swollen. But she didn't cry. She just held her cheek tightly.
Ye Lang looked at the guard and smiled, "What's your name?"
The guard hurriedly bowed, "I'm Zhang Mu. Greetings, Crown Prince."
Ye Lang nodded, "You're not bad. After I become the Crown Prince, I'll need ten guards. You can be my guard from now on."
Hearing this, Zhang Mu was overjoyed. He hurriedly bowed deeply, "I'm willing to go through fire and water for the Crown Prince!"
Ye Lang nodded slightly, "Drag him away. This person is disturbing the ancestral hall. Don't show any mercy. Do you understand?"
Zhang Mu glanced at Ye Lang. When he saw the murderous intent in Ye Lang's eyes, he understood.
He immediately grabbed Ye Ling's hair and dragged her out.
At this moment, Zhang Mu suddenly stopped when he saw something.
In the ancestral hall, everyone turned their heads to look outside.
Not far from the ancestral hall, a young man was walking toward the ancestral hall. The young man was wearing a tight-fitting robe. The robe was tattered and covered in blood.
This young man was Ye Xuan, who had rushed back from Nanshan!
Seeing Ye Xuan, Ye Lang's lips curled into a sinister smile.
Inside the ancestral hall, the Elders frowned.
The Great Elder narrowed his eyes, his face dark and gloomy. No one knew what he was thinking.
From afar, when Ye Xuan saw Zhang Mu dragging Ye Ling, his face turned savage. "Who gave you the guts to touch my sister?"
When Zhang Mu saw Ye Xuan, his face changed. He hurriedly looked at Ye Lang and was about to speak. At this time, Ye Xuan was like a ferocious tiger leaping in front of him. Before the latter could react, Ye Xuan's fist landed on his face.
Peng!
Zhang Mu felt a wave of dizziness, and he stumbled and fell.
However, Ye Ling did not stop there. He charged at Zhang Mu again. At this time, Ye Lang suddenly roared, "Ye Xuan, he's my man. How dare you …"
Ye Xuan suddenly stepped on Zhang Mu's chest.
Pu!
Zhang Mu spat out a mouthful of blood.
Seeing this, Ye Lang's face turned ugly. Ye Xuan looked up at him and said, "Your man?"
As he spoke, he stepped on Zhang Mu's face.
Zhang Mu's face turned into a bloody mess, as he screamed, "Prince, save, save me …"
Ye Xuan did not care about Zhang Mu, as he walked up to Ye Ling. Seeing Ye Ling's appearance, Ye Xuan felt as though his heart was being cut by a knife. He clenched his fists, and his entire body trembled.
When Ye Ling saw Ye Xuan, her tears flowed out, "Brother, it hurts, it hurts …"
Hearing this, Ye Xuan's expression turned savage. In the next instant, he charged in front of Zhang Mu and kicked Zhang Mu's head.
Peng!
Qingcheng, Ye Clan, Ancestral Hall.
"Ancestors, Ye Xuan has no talent, no virtue … From now on, Ye Xuan's position as Prince shall be replaced by Ye Lang."
The one who spoke was an old man in black robes.
Not far behind the old man, there was a youth with a faint smile on his face.
This person was Ye Lang.
On both sides were the Elders of the Ye Clan.
"Why!?"
At this time, a timid voice rang out in the Ancestral Hall.
Everyone turned to look and saw a little girl standing at the door. She was about 12 or 13 years old, and her hands were tightly gripping the hem of her skirt. Her face had a sickly pallor, and she looked a little weak. There was even a trace of fear in her eyes.
This little girl was called Ye Ling, and she was Ye Xuan's younger sister. When she heard that Ye Xuan was to be replaced, she disregarded her illness and rushed over.
The black-robed old man frowned, "Ye Ling, what are you doing!?"
The little girl called Ye Ling bowed to the people in the Ancestral Hall, and said timidly, "Great Elder, my brother Ye Xuan is a Prince, why did you discard him for no reason?"
The Great Elder looked at Ye Ling coldly, "This is a matter of the Clan, what are you interrupting?
Leave! "
Ye Ling was obviously afraid, and did not dare to look at the Great Elder, but she did not leave. Instead, she plucked up her courage and entered the Ancestral Hall. She bowed to the Elders on both sides, "Elders, my brother is fighting with the Li Clan over the mining rights at Nanshan. He is fighting for the Clan, and we don't know if he's dead or alive. Yet, the Clan is using a groundless excuse to discard his position. This is unfair."
"Impudent!"
The Great Elder suddenly raged, "Whether he discards his position or not, it's not up to a little girl like you to decide.
Men, drag her away. "
At this time, the new Prince, Ye Lang, suddenly laughed, "You should be flogged 30 times as a warning to others!"
The Great Elder replied coldly, "Then flog her 30 times!"
Soon, two guards of the Ye Clan rushed in.
Ye Ling clenched her fists, and said angrily, "This is unfair. My brother has risked his life for the Clan for so many years, and even now, he is fighting for the Clan. The Clan is so unfair to him …"
One of the guards glanced at the new Prince, Ye Lang. He knew that his chance to shine had come.
The guard sneered, "Young Master Ye Lang inherits the Prince's position, and it's everyone's wish. What are you yelling about?" As he spoke, he raised his hand and slapped Ye Ling's face.
Slap!
A crisp slap sounded, and the right side of Ye Ling's face instantly swelled up. However, she did not cry, and only held her cheek tightly.
Ye Lang looked at the guard, and smiled, "What's your name?"
The guard hurriedly bowed, "Subordinate Zhang Mu greets the Prince."
Ye Lang nodded, "You're not bad. After I become the Prince, I need 10 guards. You can be my guard from now on."
Hearing this, Zhang Mu was overjoyed, and hurriedly bowed deeply, "This subordinate is willing to go through fire and water for the Prince, even if it means death!"
Ye Lang nodded slightly, "Drag him out. This person is disturbing the ancestral hall, don't show mercy, understand?"
Zhang Mu glanced at Ye Lang, and when he saw the murderous intent in Ye Lang's eyes, he understood.
He immediately grabbed Ye Ling's hair and dragged her out.
At this moment, Zhang Mu seemed to have seen something, and suddenly stopped.
In the ancestral hall, everyone turned their heads to look outside.
Not far from the ancestral hall, a young man was walking towards the ancestral hall. The young man was wearing a tight-fitting robe, and the robe was tattered, and there was blood everywhere.
The young man was Ye Xuan, who had rushed back from Nanshan!
Seeing Ye Xuan, Ye Lang's lips curled into a sinister smile.
Inside the ancestral hall, the Elders frowned.
The Great Elder narrowed his eyes, and his face darkened. No one knew what he was thinking.
From afar, when Ye Xuan saw Zhang Mu dragging Ye Ling, his face turned savage, "Who gave you the guts to touch my sister?"
When Zhang Mu saw Ye Xuan, his face changed. He hurriedly looked at Ye Lang, and just as he was about to speak, Ye Xuan leaped in front of him like a ferocious tiger. Before the latter could react, Ye Xuan's fist landed on his face.
Peng!
Zhang Mu felt a wave of dizziness, and he stumbled and fell.
However, Ye Ling did not stop there. He charged towards Zhang Mu again. At this time, Ye Lang suddenly roared, "Ye Xuan, he's my man, how dare you …"
Ye Xuan suddenly stepped on Zhang Mu's chest.
Pu!
Zhang Mu spat out a mouthful of blood.
Seeing this, Ye Lang's face turned ugly. Ye Xuan looked up at him, and snarled, "Your man?"
As he spoke, he stepped on Zhang Mu's face.
Zhang Mu's face turned into a bloody mess, as he screamed, "Prince, save, save me …"
Ye Xuan did not care about Zhang Mu, as he walked to Ye Ling's side. Seeing Ye Ling's state, Ye Xuan felt as though his heart was being cut by a knife. He clenched his fists, and his entire body trembled.
When Ye Ling saw Ye Xuan, her tears flowed, "Brother, it hurts, it hurts …"
Hearing this, Ye Xuan's expression turned savage. In the next instant, he charged in front of Zhang Mu, and kicked Zhang Mu's head.
Peng!







Chapter 1429
The appearance of these experts caused the entire starry sky to tremble.
This expanse of the universe couldn't endure so many experts at all!
Meanwhile, Li Qiuheng gazed at the Heavenly Exalt and smiled, "Heavenly Exalt, my Black Illusion Sect has a total of 8 Consolidation Realm experts and 22 Dao Transformation Realm experts. The same goes for the Profound School, Dao Returnance Institute, and Xiao Clan!
What about you? "
Everyone gazed at the Heavenly Exalt.
The Heavenly Exalt grinned. She knew that the members of the Whirling Sect wanted to see An Yuan's strength.
At this moment, she had no choice but to reveal An Yuan's strength. Because if An Yuan didn't reveal his formidable strength, then he wouldn't have the right to speak!
The Heavenly Exalt smiled, "Come out!"
As soon as she finished speaking, 12 black robed experts suddenly appeared behind her!
The expressions of Li Qiuheng and the others changed slightly when they witnessed this scene!
All 12 of them were actually Consolidation Realm experts!
If the Heavenly Exalt and Earthly Exalt were included, then it was a total of 14 Consolidation Realm experts!
Besides that, there were 30 Dao Transformation Realm experts!
It could be said that An Yuan had the most experts amongst the great powers!
At this moment, the members of the Black Illusion Sect didn't dare underestimate An Yuan!
Meanwhile, a white robed old man walked forward. He glanced at them and smiled, "Everyone, I'm the Old Man, the Grand Elder of the Xiao Clan, Xiao Pingsheng. I think I should mention something in advance, and it's that there are only six scrolls of the Dao Scripture. If we kill Ye Xuan, then how will the six scrolls be divided?"
Everyone fell silent when they heard this.
How to divide the Dao Scripture was a very important question!
Xiao Pingsheng smiled, "We wouldn't have to kill each other then, right?"
Meanwhile, the Heavenly Exalt suddenly said, "Elder Xiao, I think it's not suitable for us to talk about this now!"
Xiao Pingsheng gazed at the Heavenly Exalt, "But this isn't a problem that can't be resolved without discussing it!"
The Heavenly Exalt gazed at Xiao Pingsheng, "Elder Xiao, the premise of this question is that we're able to kill Ye Xuan and annihilate the power that stands behind him. However, do you think we're 100% confident in our ability?"
Xiao Pingsheng chuckled and said, "It's not that I look down on Ye Xuan, but I really can't find any force in the entire universe that can fight against our joint forces!
Even with the help of the Ancient God Abyss and the Whirling Sect, it was impossible!
According to what I know, the Whirling Sect has already chosen not to interfere in this matter. As for the Ancient God Abyss, haven't they already left the Fifth Dimension? "
The Empyrean shook his head. "Elder Xiao, the influence behind Ye Xuan is unknown to us, and the unknown means that anything is possible!"
Xiao Pingsheng was about to speak when Li Qiuheng suddenly said, "What the Heavenly Venerate said makes sense. I think it's still too early for us to talk about the Dao Scriptures!
It wasn't appropriate either!
It wouldn't be too late to discuss the matter of the Dao Scripture after he destroyed Ye Xuan and the forces behind him.
And if we talk about it now, it's very likely to cause some unnecessary trouble and problems. "
Hu Buhui also nodded, "Let's get rid of Ye Xuan first!"
Seeing this, Xiao Pingsheng did not insist. He immediately nodded, "Then let's get rid of Ye Xuan first!"
At this moment, Li Qiuheng suddenly laughed, "Speaking of which, with so many of us, will the forces behind Ye Xuan be so scared that they won't dare to show themselves?
If that's the case, then this trip to the Fifth Dimension will be too boring! "
The Empyrean chuckled, "Let's go!
Let's go and meet Ye Xuan! "
Everyone nodded.
Soon, everyone disappeared. When they reappeared, they were already in the sky above the Dao City.
When so many experts appeared in the sky above the Dao City, everyone in the Dao City was petrified.
Then, everyone fell into despair!
Even Revered Mi felt despair at this moment!
So many experts!
How could the current Fifth Dimension fight against them?
Below, Ye Xuan walked out of the Sword Hall and looked up at the sky. When he saw so many experts in the sky, he fell silent.
They really wanted to gang up on Ye Xuan!
Ye Xuan slowly walked towards the sky. At this moment, a little girl appeared beside him.
It was Nian Nian!
Nian Nian grabbed Ye Xuan's hand and softly said, "I'll go with you!"
Ye Xuan smiled, "Okay!"
At this moment, Zhang Wenxiu, An Lanxiu, and Lian Wanli also appeared beside him.
There were also two people he was very familiar with. They were Xiao Dao and Qian Mo!
Ye Xuan looked at Xiao Dao and smiled, "You shouldn't have come at this time!"
Xiao Dao looked at Ye Xuan and said, "If I didn't come now, I might not have the chance to come in the future!"
Ye Xuan shook his head and smiled. He looked at Qian Mo, "Miss Qian Mo, what about you?"
Although he had slept with Qian Mo, that was Sister Nian's sin.
There were feelings between him and Qian Mo, but there didn't seem to be any. On the other hand, they had dual cultivated!
What was this?
Were they sleeping partners?
Qian Mo looked at Ye Xuan and didn't say anything.
Ye Xuan was about to speak when the Celestial Venerate in the sky suddenly smiled, "Ye Xuan, you seem to have a lot of female confidantes!"
Ye Xuan looked up at the Celestial Venerate and said with a smile, "Celestial Venerate, to be honest, aren't you overestimating me?
Let me count, tsk tsk, 46 Consolidation Realm, more than 100 Dao Attainment Realm … I'm only at Dao Defense Realm!
Aren't you guys going too far? "
The Celestial Venerate looked at Ye Xuan and said with a smile, "I've investigated you. You had many opponents in the past, but they're all dead!
Why?
There's a very important reason, and that's because they looked down on you!
They didn't go all out!
They always gave you a chance to grow!
So, you're alive, but they're dead!
We won't make their mistakes!
Look, we value you enough, right? "
Ye Xuan was silent.
The Celestial Venerate looked around and said with a smile, "Ye Xuan, where are your people?"
Ye Xuan looked around and cursed in his heart, I also want to know where my people are!
At this time, Li Qiuheng suddenly smiled, "If an expert appears, with our strength, even if they're millions of miles away, we'll still be able to sense them!
Unfortunately, I don't sense any powerful aura! "
As he said this, he looked at Ye Xuan, "Ye Xuan, don't tell me the people behind you are afraid?"
Below, Ye Xuan suddenly turned to Venerable Mi and the rest, "You guys go!"
Venerable Mi and the rest were stunned.
Ye Xuan smiled, "There's no point in staying here!"
Venerable Mi was silent.
Ye Xuan looked at Guan Yin below, "Go!"
Guan Yin was silent.
Go!
It was obvious that the Fifth Dimension had no chance of winning!
With all the experts of the Whirling World and the Dark Abyss joining hands, how could Ye Xuan resist?
It should be known that these factions had a foundation of hundreds of thousands of years or even hundreds of thousands of years!
And what about Ye Xuan?
His biggest support was Nian Nian, but now, Nian Nian had become a little girl. Not only could she not help Ye Xuan, but she also needed Ye Xuan to protect her …
It could be said that the Fifth Dimension was a dead end!
At this time, Ye Xuan looked at Dao City below, "Everyone, leave!"
He did not ask everyone to face the Whirling World and the Ancient God Abyss with him, because that was equivalent to sending others to their deaths!
In fact, he himself wanted to run away!
But he knew that he could not escape, and he did not want to escape!
He promised Sister Nian that he would protect this part of the universe, and he would do his best to do what he promised.
Hearing Ye Xuan's words, the people below had a complicated expression.
They knew that Ye Xuan wanted them to escape!
Ye Xuan looked at the people below and smiled, "I'm sorry, I don't have the ability to protect you!"
Below, countless people suddenly slowly bowed to Ye Xuan.
In fact, Ye Xuan not only changed the Fifth Dimension, but he also changed the fate of everyone!
In the past, the Fifth Dimension, the Sixth Dimension, and the Dao World did not have a single True Release Realm expert, but now, let alone True Release Realm experts, there were many Dao Validation Realm experts!
Moreover, Ye Xuan also shared the Dao Scripture … It could be said that Ye Xuan changed everyone's fate!
At this moment, when many people heard Ye Xuan asking them to leave, their hearts were incomparably complicated.
Unknowingly, they had already regarded the Fifth Dimension as their home.
Here, it was really harmonious!
In the sky, Ye Xuan smiled again and said, "Everyone, it is I, Ye Xuan, who does not have the ability to protect everyone and this part of the universe. It has nothing to do with you!"
Below, an old man suddenly said in a trembling voice, "Dao Master, why don't you escape? If you escape, with your talent, you might be able to contend against these people in the future!"
Escape?
Ye Xuan smiled lightly. "They won't let me escape. Of course, I won't escape either!"
As he said that, he turned to look at Nian Nian beside him and said with a smile, "I swore to you before. At that time, I said that I would live and die with the Five-Dimensional Universe in the future … Although I was just playing tricks at that time, I never thought that this oath would actually come true!"
Nian Nian nodded slightly. She tightly held onto Ye Xuan's hand. "I will go with you!"
Ye Xuan smiled. "Okay!"
As he spoke, he looked at Dao City below. "Everyone, stop wasting time!
Let's go! "
Below, many people hesitated for a moment before fleeing one after another.
This was a battle that they had no chance of winning!
But there were still some people who stayed. Of course, there were not many!
Ye Xuan suddenly looked at Venerable Mi. At this moment, an old man appeared beside Venerable Mi.
The person who came was Bai Dizi!
Bai Dizi said softly, "They can let those people below go, but they won't let us go!"
Ye Xuan looked at Bai Dizi and smiled. "Bai Dizi, as far as I know, your escaping skills are top-notch. Why don't you escape?"
Bai Dizi looked at Ye Xuan. "You are Daoting's only hope. If you die, then Daoting really doesn't exist anymore!
If Daoting is gone, there is not much meaning in me living!
So, let me accompany you to death! "
Ye Xuan was speechless.
Venerable Mi suddenly said, "Bai Dizi is right. You are the Daoting's last hope. If you perish today, then Daoting will have no more hope. If Daoting has no more hope, then what's the point of us living?"
As he spoke, he gazed at Ye Xuan and smiled. "Today, let us accompany you on your last journey!"
Ye Xuan smiled. Then he said, "I didn't expect that we would have to live and die together today. Life is so wonderful!"
As he spoke, he gazed at An Lanxiu and the others. His gaze swept past them with a complicated expression. "I really want to let all of you go, but I know that all of you definitely won't …."
When he spoke up to this point, he grinned. "All of you wanted to return the favor in the afterlife, but I feel like they won't allow me to have an afterlife. So, I'm sorry!
If there is a next life, please don't meet a man like me. Even I feel like I'm trash! "
Zhang Wenxiu gazed at Ye Xuan. "You've finally spoken the truth!"
Ye Xuan laughed. He glanced at the women again and said, "I don't want to see all of you die because that would be worse than death. So, let me die before all of you!"
As he spoke, he looked up at Venerable Tianji and the others and said softly, "I want to defy the heavens and change my fate. I want to protect all of you and the Fifth Dimension by myself. But I can't do it!
Reality is just so cruel! "
As he spoke, the blood within his body suddenly surged. In the next moment, a flame suddenly ignited within his body!
Bloodline ignition!
That wasn't all!
His soul actually started to ignite as well!
...
In a certain distant starry sky, a woman in a white robe suddenly stopped. She seemed to have sensed something, and she clenched her fists tightly while her eyes almost split apart from rage. "Brother!
Wait for me!
Wait for me! "
As she spoke, she suddenly vanished at the end of the starry sky, and everywhere she passed was annihilated inch by inch ….
....







Chapter 1430
In the sky above Dao City, Ye Xuan's ignition of his soul and bloodline shocked everyone!
Even the Celestial Venerables and the others were shocked.
They didn't expect Ye Xuan to directly ignite his bloodline and soul!
The Celestial Venerables stared at Ye Xuan, "Where is the person behind you!"
She had been waiting for the person behind Ye Xuan to appear.
But now, there was no one!
Could it be that Ye Xuan didn't have any force behind him?
Or could it be that the force behind Ye Xuan wasn't strong at all? After seeing the Whirling Sect and An Yuan joining forces, the force behind him was afraid!
They didn't dare to appear!
Below, Ye Xuan suddenly laughed, "Celestial Venerables, I want to see the power of a Consolidation Realm expert before I die. Can you satisfy me?"
The Celestial Venerables looked at Ye Xuan, "Where is the person behind you!"
"I'm afraid he won't dare to appear!"
Li Qiuheng suddenly laughed, "Just like the Ancient God Abyss, once the price is too high, no one will be willing to protect Ye Xuan!
So, Ye Xuan must have been abandoned. He has been abandoned! "
The Celestial Venerables scanned the surroundings, but still didn't sense any powerful aura.
No one appeared!
At this moment, Li Qiuheng suddenly laughed, "Ye Xuan, didn't you want to see the power of a Consolidation Realm expert?
I'll fulfill your wish! "
With that, he suddenly disappeared.
Down below, Ye Xuan laughed. "Bring it on!"
With that, he leaped up and slashed at the sky with his sword.
Dao Sword!
This slash was unprecedentedly powerful!
After igniting his bloodline and soul, Ye Xuan's strength skyrocketed like a volcanic eruption!
And the moment Ye Xuan slashed with his sword, he also used his Dao Seal!
With the enhancement of the Dao Seal, bloodline, and soul, although he wasn't at the Dao Attainment Realm, his aura was several times stronger than an average Dao Attainment Realm expert!
With this slash, a trace of shock flashed in the eyes of the Celestial Venerables!
Ye Xuan was only at the Dao Defense Realm!
He was actually able to display such a powerful sword!
The Empyrean looked down at Ye Xuan, "Truly a monster!"
At the moment when Ye Xuan slashed out with his sword, a fist print swept down from the sky and directly blasted on Ye Xuan's sword.
Boom!
Under everyone's gaze, Ye Xuan returned to his original position. Li Qiuheng also returned to his original position. On his right fist, there was a deep sword scar.
At this moment, Li Qiuheng's eyes turned solemn.
This Ye Xuan's strength had actually reached such a level!
Meanwhile, the distant Heavenly Exalt suddenly said, "He's still getting stronger!"
Everyone looked at Ye Xuan and saw that Ye Xuan's aura was still rising crazily, as if there was no limit.
Meanwhile, Ye Xuan's body was slowly turning illusory!
At this moment, Ye Xuan suddenly looked up at Li Qiuheng. "Again!"
As soon as he finished speaking, he suddenly disappeared on the spot.
Hiss!
A ray of sword light shot into the sky from below!
A strand of monstrous sword energy shook the heavens and the earth, and it was so powerful that all the experts in the surroundings were visibly moved!
Li Qiuheng's eyes narrowed slightly, and then he suddenly clenched his right fist. At the instant he clenched his fist, the space around his fist suddenly transformed into a spatial vortex. In the next moment, he suddenly smashed his fist forward!
Bang!
The spatial vortex suddenly swept down, and the entire sky actually warped at this moment!
Meanwhile, Ye Xuan's sword arrived before him.
Bang!
The spectators watched as Ye Xuan's sword slashed against the spatial vortex. The entire heavens and the earth trembled violently, and then the spatial vortex exploded apart and transformed into nothingness.
The sword continued forward and slashed straight at Li Qiuheng.
A wisp of viciousness flashed through Li Qiuheng's eyes. He flicked his sleeve, took a step forward, squatted down, clenched his right fist, and then smashed it down. "Obliterate!"
A strand of obliterating energy swept down, and everywhere it passed, space was obliterated!
Bang!
Ye Xuan and his sword were blasted back to where they stood earlier, and the space before him and Li Qiuheng had become pitch black!
At the same time, a wisp of blood slowly seeped out from the corner of Ye Xuan's mouth.
In the sky, Li Qiuheng looked down at Ye Xuan and said, "It's over!"
As soon as he finished speaking, he suddenly stomped his right foot on the ground, and then his figure plunged down. This charge seemed as if he intended to smash this expanse of the heavens and the earth into pieces. It was an extremely shocking sight!
Ye Xuan's eyes slowly closed while his right hand clenched tightly onto his sword. At this moment, he felt like he wasn't himself anymore!
Strength!
He felt like his body possessed boundless strength!
He'd never felt so strong in his life!
Of course, he knew that he'd obtained all of this at the cost of his life!
Ye Xuan didn't think too much about it and suddenly opened his eyes. In the next moment, he transformed into a fiery red ray of light that shot into the sky!
Bang!
Under the gazes of everyone, Ye Xuan slashed Li Qiuheng back with a single strike of his sword, and the latter directly retreated 3km away!
The eyes of the Heavenly Exalt in the sky instantly narrowed when he saw this scene. Ye Xuan's strength was unusually strong!
The other experts had extremely solemn expressions as well. Ye Xuan's current strength wasn't inferior to a Consolidation Realm expert in the slightest!
Even though Ye Xuan had paid the price with his life, it was still too terrifying!
In the sky, Li Qiuheng glanced at his chest. There was a sword mark there, and it was extremely deep to the point his bones could be seen!
Li Qiuheng's expression was extremely unsightly!
He'd never imagined that he'd actually been injured by Ye Xuan twice in succession!
An extraordinary humiliation!
Li Qiuheng looked down at Ye Xuan. Right at this moment, Ye Xuan suddenly vanished on the spot.
Om!
A sword howl shook the heavens and the earth as a ray of light shot into the sky from below and slashed straight at Li Qiuheng!
The expressions of everyone in the surroundings instantly changed when they saw this attack!
This attack was even stronger than the previous one!
Each attack was stronger than the previous one!
Li Qiuheng didn't dare act carelessly in the sky. He pressed his palms together, and then he flipped his palms outwards when the attack arrived in front of him before swiftly pressing them forward.
Bang!
A powerful force swept out like a volcanic eruption from his palms!
As soon as this force appeared, the entire sky instantly became illusory!
Bang!
Ye Xuan's attack had been forcefully blocked!
However, Li Qiuheng's countenance instantly turned ghastly pale!
Meanwhile, Ye Xuan suddenly stomped his right foot on the ground, and then he spun forward with his sword in hand.
Hiss!
The sound of something tearing resounded. Li Qiuheng's pupils constricted, and then he swiftly moved his arms forward to block Ye Xuan's attack!
Bang!
As soon as Ye Xuan's sword descended, Li Qiuheng was instantly pushed over 10km back. At the same time, one of his arms had been slashed into pieces by Ye Xuan!
The Heavenly Exalt stared fixedly at Ye Xuan from afar. At this moment, she suddenly realized that she'd overlooked Ye Xuan until now!
Even though she felt that Ye Xuan was an extraordinary genius, Ye Xuan hadn't been able to pose any threat to her at all.
But at this moment, she suddenly realized that her thoughts were wrong!
If Ye Xuan were to mature, then he would be extraordinarily terrifying!
The experts from Whirling World had extremely solemn expressions on their faces as well. Because Ye Xuan's combat strength had far exceeded their expectations. It could be said that not to mention the Fifth Dimension, even if Ye Xuan was in Whirling World, he would definitely be the number one expert in the younger generation!
Ye Xuan must die!
At this moment, both the Dark Abyss and Whirling World had unanimously come to a common understanding!
The best way to deal with a genius was to strangle him!
At this moment, Ye Xuan once again rushed towards Li Qiuheng from afar. Wherever the sword light passed, it tore through everything!
In the distance, Li Qiuheng's pupils suddenly shrank as he hurriedly said, "Attack!"
At this moment, he no longer dared to fight against Ye Xuan by himself!
As soon as his voice fell, two Consolidation Realm experts from the Xuanhuan Sect suddenly appeared in front of him!
But Ye Xuan didn't choose to retreat!
He slashed out with his sword!
The two experts suddenly disappeared from where they stood!
Rumble!
Rumble!
The sky trembled violently. Under the joint attack of the two Consolidation Realm powerhouses, Ye Xuan was forced to retreat repeatedly. However, he did not retreat for long before he suddenly stopped and slashed forward.
Chi!
A blood-red sword light pierced through the air!
Boom!
This sword strike directly forced the two Consolidation Realm experts to retreat!
Seeing this scene, the expressions of the Heavenly Exalt and the others not far away became even more unsightly!
Ye Xuan's strength was constantly growing!
Stronger and stronger!
At this moment, Ye Xuan suddenly disappeared from where he stood. When he reappeared, he was already in front of one of the Consolidation Realm experts. Just like before, he slashed down with his sword again!
The Consolidation Realm expert didn't dare to be careless and was about to attack with all his might when a sudden change occurred. A black and white Tai Chi circle suddenly appeared above his head, and in an instant, his realm was directly suppressed to the Dao Attainment Realm!
At the same time, Ye Xuan's four domains directly enveloped the old man!
This sudden turn of events caused the old man's expression to change drastically. He was just about to retreat, but it was too late.
Ye Xuan's sword fell.
Chi!
Under everyone's gaze, Ye Xuan's sword slashed straight down from the old man's head.
Chi!
The sword slashed to the end, and the old man's body was split into two.
His soul was directly destroyed!
The surroundings suddenly fell silent when they witnessed this scene!
Ye Xuan had killed a Consolidation Realm expert!
After all, Ye Xuan was only at the Dao Attainment Realm at this moment!
Killing an enemy two levels above him?
Not far away, the experts of the Whirling World looked at Ye Xuan as if they were looking at a monster!
At this moment, Hu Bugui, who was next to the Celestial Venerable, suddenly said, 'This person is too monstrous!
Kill him! '
The Celestial Venerable nodded. "Kill him!"
As soon as her voice fell, a dozen Consolidation Realm experts suddenly rushed out in unison, heading straight for Ye Xuan!
Seeing the dozen Consolidation Realm experts rushing over, Ye Xuan turned his head and glanced. He saw An Lanxiu, Nian Nian, Zhang Wenxiu, Lian Wanli, Xiao Dao, and Qian Mo …
The only regret was that he didn't see Ye Ling!
But it was good that Ye Ling wasn't here, so he could live on!
As long as he could live on, that was good!
Ye Xuan slowly closed his eyes. "Ling 'er … I can't go find you!
Don't blame me … You must live well … "
At this point, he suddenly opened his eyes, looked at the Consolidation Realm experts rushing towards him, and laughed. "Come on!"
As his voice fell, he began to completely release all his power!
Self-destruct!
Not far away, Li Qiuheng said somewhat crazily, "Kill him!
Kill him! "
As soon as he finished speaking, the experts behind him also rushed out one after another.
And at this moment, a beast-like roar came from nowhere. "Who dares to touch him!
Who dares!
Ahhhhh! "
The starry sky trembled!
.....
PS: Vote for me!







Chapter 1431
Everyone was stunned when they heard this voice!
Who is it?
Ye Xuan listened to it as well, and he looked towards the depths of the starry sky. The voice was slightly familiar, but he couldn't recall who it was!
The Heavenly Venerable's eyes narrowed.
It's here!
The force behind Ye Xuan has finally appeared!
Hu Bugui raised his head and frowned. "I don't sense her aura!"
The nearby Xiao Clan's Xiao Pingsheng said in a low voice, "The person hasn't arrived, but his voice arrived first!"
Hu Bugui said softly, "Looks like it's not easy to deal with her!"
Xiao Pingsheng spoke indifferently, "It's good to increase the difficulty. Otherwise, it would be too boring!"
Hu Bugui smiled, "Indeed!"
They were curious about the force behind Ye Xuan, but they weren't afraid at all!
What a joke! A few dozen Consolidation Realm experts were gathered here!
Did they need to be afraid?
Suddenly, Li Qiuheng spoke fiercely, "No matter who she is, kill Ye Xuan first!"
As soon as he finished speaking, he charged towards Ye Xuan.
Ye Xuan was an arrow at the end of its flight, and it was the best time to kill him!
In next to no time, Li Qiuheng arrived in front of Ye Xuan, and then he smashed his fist towards Ye Xuan!
At this moment, Ye Xuan was powerless to resist because he'd overdrawn all his strength!
He could only watch as the fist smashed towards him!
Right at this moment, the Executing Heaven Sword in his hand suddenly trembled violently, and numerous sword howls shook the heavens and the earth. At the same time, the space in front of Ye Xuan was suddenly torn apart, and then a woman walked out from within it.
The woman wore a white robe and had a wine gourd hanging from her waist.
Along with the appearance of this woman, the gazes of everyone present descended onto her.
Who is she?
Ye Xuan grinned when he saw her. "Qing 'er!"
She was Qing 'er as well!
But she wasn't a woman in a plain dress!
Meanwhile, Li Qiuheng had arrived behind her.
Li Qiuheng stared at the woman who had just appeared and said fiercely: "You can go and die too!"
As soon as he finished speaking, his left hand suddenly blasted a punch towards the woman. However, in the next moment, he was stunned.
It wasn't just Li Qiuheng who was stunned, everyone else was stunned as well!
Because a hand that was pure white like jade had suddenly grabbed onto Li Qiuheng's throat.
This hand belonged to the white-robed woman!
No one saw how the white-robed woman attacked!
Even Li Qiuheng was dumbfounded at this moment. How did he get caught?
The white-robed woman looked at Li Qiuheng. She lifted Li Qiuheng up like a little chick, her eyes bloodshot. "What kind of trash are you?"
At this moment, everyone in the surroundings was stunned.
At this moment, the expressions of the powerhouses from the Whirling World turned solemn!
A Consolidation Realm expert was actually powerless in front of this woman?
The one who felt the most despair was still Li Qiuheng!
He wanted to resist, but at this moment, all his strength seemed to have disappeared. He couldn't resist at all!
At this moment, the white-robed woman exerted some force with her right hand.
Ka-cha!
A clear and melodious sound of bones breaking resounded in the field!
Immediately after, under everyone's gaze, she directly plucked off Li Qiuheng's head. In the next moment, she held Li Qiuheng's head and threw it to the right.
Boom!
In the distance, a Consolidation Realm powerhouse was directly smashed by the head before he could react!
Instant kill!
Instantly killing two Consolidation Realm powerhouses!
At this moment, the expressions of the Sky Sovereign and the others finally changed!
At this moment, they seemed to realize the seriousness of the matter!
Killing a Consolidation Realm powerhouse was like killing a chicken!
The white-robed woman didn't attack again. Instead, she turned to look at Ye Xuan. Ye Xuan grinned. "I'm going to die!"
At this moment, he felt extremely weak. Especially his soul, it was terrifyingly weak.
The power of his bloodline was fine because he realized that although he had burned the power of his bloodline, it was useless!
Even he couldn't extinguish his own blood!
He had to admit that this made him feel a little ridiculous!
If he couldn't do anything to his own blood, what the hell was this?
The white-robed woman looked at Ye Xuan, and tears suddenly flowed from her eyes. "With me here, how can you die?"
As she spoke, she gently placed her right hand on Ye Xuan's shoulder. In the next moment, a powerful force directly enveloped Ye Xuan. At the same time, with a wave of her right hand, the Soul Suppressing Sword appeared in her hand. She glanced at the Soul Suppressing Sword, then suddenly stabbed it into Ye Xuan's chest.
Boom!
Suppressing the soul with the sword!
Ye Xuan's soul, which was about to dissipate, was forcibly suppressed by her power and the Soul Suppressing Sword!
The white-robed woman looked at Ye Xuan. "You need to nourish yourself!"
After saying that, she turned to look at the Sky Sovereign and the others and said fiercely, "My brother's soul is weak. Why don't you all die?"
As soon as her voice fell, she suddenly punched out!
A hundred feet away, a Consolidation Realm powerhouse died on the spot!
Seeing this scene, everyone present was petrified!
At this moment, the seriousness in the eyes of the Sky Sovereign and the others had turned into fear!
With just one punch, the Consolidation Realm powerhouse died instantly!
That was a Consolidation Realm powerhouse!
The strongest powerhouse in the world!
Not only the Sky Sovereign and the others, but Su Zhe and the others who were hiding in the dark were also stunned.
Su Zhe gulped. He looked at Ye Xuan below and said with a trembling voice, "This Young Master Ye's sister … What kind of deities are they …"
On the other side, the Lord and the others were silent.
Especially Luo Hou and Ah Ku Wang. At this moment, both of them were sweating profusely.
Back then, they had wanted to kill Ye Xuan and obtain the Dao Scripture!
If they really killed Ye Xuan …
The two of them did not dare to think about the consequences!
Yan Yaoyao looked at the weak Ye Xuan in the distance and said softly, "We still underestimated him!"
It was not just her. Everyone had underestimated the people behind Ye Xuan!
In the distance, after the white-robed woman killed the Consolidation Realm powerhouse with a punch, she waved her right hand and the Consolidation Realm powerhouse's soul was directly caught in her hand. Then, she turned around and placed the soul in front of Ye Xuan. "Absorb!"
Ye Xuan, "…"
At this moment, the Sky Sovereign suddenly said in a deep voice, "Your Excellency, what happened between us and Young Master Ye was a misunderstanding!"
The white-robed woman suddenly turned around and in the next moment, she suddenly appeared in front of the Sky Sovereign. The Sky Sovereign's pupils suddenly shrank. Before he could react, the white-robed woman punched him in the face.
Boom!
The Sky Sovereign's head exploded like a watermelon!
The white-robed woman grabbed the Sky Sovereign's soul, her face expressionless. "This is also a misunderstanding!"
The Sky Sovereign's soul stared at the white-robed woman. "Who the hell are you!"
The white-robed woman did not answer the Sky Sovereign. She sent the Sky Sovereign's soul in front of Ye Xuan. "Absorb!"
Ye Xuan, "…"
The Sky Sovereign suddenly laughed self-deprecatingly. "Ridiculous!
I'm really ridiculous! "
All this time, her goal had been to deal with the people behind Ye Xuan, but at this moment, she realized how ridiculous her idea was!
The person in front of her was definitely far beyond the Consolidation Realm, and had even reached a realm that even she did not know!
The reason why the people behind Ye Xuan were not in this universe was because they were too strong, and this world was too weak!
They did not want to play in this world!
This was great!
She and the others had joined forces to force them back!
What was courting death?
She was courting death!
At this moment, a voice suddenly came from the horizon. "Your Excellency, do you really have to be so ruthless?"
Hearing this, the Sky Sovereign suddenly looked up.
There were two old men standing in the sky!
One wore a white robe, and the other wore a black robe!
The Dark Abyss Yin Yang God!
Seeing these two, the Sky Sovereign, who had originally given up resisting, suddenly opened her eyes. At this moment, she saw hope!
Yin Yang God!
These two had reached the peak of the Consolidation Realm tens of thousands of years ago!
As for now, their strength was unfathomable, and even she did not know how strong they were!
At this moment, the white-robed woman looked up at the Yin Yang God, and among them, the white-robed old man looked at the white-robed woman. "Don't go too far!"
The white-robed woman's lips curled into a mocking smile. "Go too far?
I'll show you what it means to go too far! "
As soon as she finished speaking, she suddenly disappeared on the spot.
In the sky, the Yin Yang God's expressions changed drastically, and the white-robed old man who led them directly smashed his fist down!
This fist smashed down, and the entire starry sky trembled as if it was about to collapse. It was extremely terrifying.
At this moment, the white-robed woman suddenly punched out.
Boom!
Under everyone's gaze, the white-robed old man's power suddenly disappeared, and at the same time, the white-robed old man was directly sent flying tens of thousands of feet away. As soon as he stopped, his physical body directly exploded, and only his soul remained!
At the same time, the white-robed woman punched out again, but this time, her target was the black-robed old man on the other side!
The black-robed old man didn't even have the chance to react before his body exploded into pieces!
It was an instant kill!
Everyone here was petrified when they witnessed this scene!
As for the Heavenly Exalt, he felt despair!
He truly felt despair!
The Yin Yang God actually didn't even have the ability to fight back before her!
How strong is she?
The white-robed woman directly brought the Yin Yang God's souls over to Ye Xuan, and then she gazed at Ye Xuan and spoke gently, "Quickly absorb them!
Replenish them! "
Ye Xuan was speechless.
When she saw Ye Xuan stunned, the white-robed woman spoke gently, "Don't just stand there!
Quickly absorb them! "
The expressions of everyone here became extremely strange when they witnessed this scene.
This woman was as bad-tempered as a volcano in front of others, but she was as gentle as water in front of Ye Xuan.
Ye Xuan hesitated for a moment, and then he gazed at the Heavenly Exalt's soul. The Heavenly Exalt stared fixedly at Ye Xuan with slight resentment, "Ye Xuan, why didn't you tell me earlier that the person behind you is so heaven defying!?"
Ye Xuan gazed at the Heavenly Exalt and said, "Would you believe me if I told you that I'm the son of the Ninth Dimension?"
The Heavenly Exalt turned to gaze at the white-robed woman, but she remained expressionless, "What's the point of being the son of the Ninth Dimension?
Big Brother, if you want, then I can destroy the Ninth Dimension and make you the master of it! "
Ye Xuan was speechless.
The Heavenly Exalt was speechless.
Suddenly, a formidable aura suddenly assaulted them from afar, and it was so strong that it caused the entire starry sky to tremble!
Everyone here raised their heads and looked towards the depths of the starry sky when they witnessed this scene.
The white-robed woman's eyes narrowed slightly, and there was a rare trace of seriousness in them.
Meanwhile, the Heavenly Exalt suddenly gazed towards the depths of the starry sky and spoke in a trembling voice, "It's definitely an expert of my Dark Abyss!
Could it be the Abyss Master? "
The Abyss Master?
Hope arose in the eyes of the Yin and Yang Gods when they heard the Heavenly Exalt!
The Abyss Master!
That was a true powerhouse above the Consolidation Realm!
Moreover, that was an expert that had surpassed the Consolidation Realm over 100,000 years ago!
On the other side, the experts of the Peaceful Whirling World were quite excited as well!
A top-rate expert of the Dark Abyss has arrived!
There's hope!
Didn't they notice that the invincible white-robed woman's expression had become slightly solemn?
The aura in the starry sky was growing stronger and stronger, and it was so strong that it wasn't inferior to the white-robed woman at all!
Right at this moment, the starry sky was suddenly torn apart, and then a woman walked out from within it.
She held a sword in her hand!
After she walked out, she glanced at the crowd below and said, "Who bullied the members of the Yang Clan?"
Everyone was speechless.
...







Chapter 1432
Who's bullying the members of the Yang Clan?
Everyone in the surroundings was stunned when they heard this.
Ye Xuan was stunned as well.
Who's here?
On the other hand, the Heavenly Exalt and the others were stunned as well. Because there were quite a few people here, and it was the Master of the Dark Abyss!
After all, the Master of the Dark Abyss was a man!
Suddenly, the Heavenly Exalt's pupils constricted, "You … you're Situ Tingyun!"
Situ Tingyun!
The expressions of the Yin and Yang Gods changed drastically when they heard the Heavenly Exalt!
Situ Tingyun!
This name was simply like a nightmare to An's Abyss!
It was exactly that woman who'd fought her way into An's Abyss all those years ago, and she'd practically destroyed it!
If she hadn't suddenly left, then An's Abyss would have been gone by now!
She's here!
The Heavenly Exalt felt utter despair!
She'd vanished for countless years, yet she'd returned to this universe for Ye Xuan's sake!
At this moment, she suddenly realized how naïve her intentions to annihilate the people standing behind Ye Xuan were!
Any random person standing behind Ye Xuan wasn't someone they could deal with!
On the other side, the experts from the Whirling World were dumbfounded.
That woman isn't from An's Abyss but from Ye Xuan's side?
We're finished!
At this moment, the experts from Whirling World felt despair as well!
Just the white robed woman was enough to make them feel despair!
Now, a Swordsman who wasn't inferior to the white robed woman had joined the fray ….
Situ Tingyun's gaze suddenly descended onto Ye Xuan, "It's you!"
Ye Xuan hesitated for a moment before he said, "Are you Senior Situ Tingyun?"
Situ Tingyun smiled, "You should call me Senior Sister!"
Senior Sister!
Ye Xuan was speechless.
Situ Tingyun walked over to Ye Xuan, sized up Ye Xuan, and then shook her head, "He's on the weak side!"
Ye Xuan broke out in a cold sweat!
Situ Tingyun suddenly gazed at the white robed woman. The white robed woman had a calm expression on her face.
Situ Tingyun smiled, "I've heard of you!"
The white-robed woman glanced at Situ Tingyun. "He's indeed the person with the greatest natural talent in the Sword Dao after him!
No, your talent in the Sword Dao is above his! "
Situ Tingyun!
Actually, the white-robed woman was not exaggerating!
After all, Situ Tingyun had relied on the green clothed man's three strands of Sword Intent to attain her current accomplishments. It could be said that besides the green clothed man, Situ Tingyun's accomplishments in the Sword Sect were the highest!
Situ Tingyun smiled and said, "Shall we get down to business first?"
White Robe nodded and looked at Ye Xuan. "Absorb it quickly!"
Ye Xuan did not hesitate. He absorbed the souls of the Celestial Venerate and the Yin-Yang Gods. After absorbing the souls of the three, his soul recovered at a ridiculous rate.
While Ye Xuan was digesting those formidable souls, the white robed woman suddenly turned around to gaze at the members of the Whirling World. Meanwhile, an old man walked forward!
The old man bowed slightly to the white-robed woman. "I am Xiao Pingsheng from the Xiao Clan. Greetings, Senior …"
The white-robed woman suddenly punched out!
Boom!
Xiao Pingsheng died instantly!
His soul was annihilated!
Everyone was speechless.
At this moment, the remaining experts of the Whirling World were shocked to the extreme!
It was an instant kill!
It wouldn't be so terrifying if it was just a victory!
But it was an instant kill!
A peak Consolidation Realm expert didn't even have the ability to fight back!
At this moment, Hu Bugui from the Dao Returning Courtyard suddenly said.
Bu Gui suddenly said, "Retreat!"
With that, he turned around and fled!
They could only flee!
They had no chance against the white-robed god of death!
The white-robed woman glanced at Hu Bugui. "Did I allow you to flee?"
As soon as she finished speaking, she suddenly punched out!
Boom!
In the distance, Hu Bugui's expression changed drastically. He suddenly turned around and punched out!
He knew he couldn't beat her, but he had to fight. If he didn't fight, he would definitely die. If he fought, he might have a chance to live!
Boom!
As soon as Hu Bugui punched out, a powerful force swept out from his fist like a tide. However, in the next moment, this powerful force vanished without a trace. At the same time, his entire body was forcefully wiped out by a powerful force!
It was directly wiped out!
The white-robed woman didn't stop. She suddenly pointed with her finger and the Executing Heaven Sword flew out. The next moment, a ray of sword light pierced through the air and traveled tens of thousands of miles.
Chi!
The sword traveled tens of thousands of miles. In the sky, bloody heads kept falling …
Seeing this scene, Su Zhe and the others who were hiding in the dark looked extremely fearful.
One should know that the Whirling Sect and the Dark Abyss had dozens of Consolidation Realm experts and more than a hundred Dao Attainment Realm experts!
However, these people were like vegetables being chopped up. They didn't even have the ability to fight back!
That sword directly killed dozens of Dao Attainment Realm and Consolidation Realm experts!
This strength …
Su Zhe wiped the cold sweat off his forehead. He once again looked at Ye Xuan who was still absorbing souls not far away. "This Young Master Ye's sister … I don't know how many sisters he has … It's too scary!"
On the other side, the Lord and the others were silent.
They had to admit that they had been dealt a heavy blow!
What was a strong expert?
This was a strong expert!
As for themselves, they were as weak as chickens in front of such a strong expert …
On the other side, Xuan Chu was also watching this scene.
In front of her stood a woman. It was Yue Zun, who had come into contact with Ye Xuan before!
At this moment, Yue Zun's expression was extremely grave!
Before she came, she had specially investigated Ye Xuan. Of course, she mainly wanted to investigate the white-robed woman.
However, she didn't expect that the white-robed woman would appear instead of the white-robed woman!
She also didn't expect that the white-robed woman would be so powerful. She definitely far surpassed Consolidation Realm experts!
This time, the Dark Abyss and the Whirling World had kicked an iron plate!
Behind Yue Zun, the Great Elder of the Whirling Sect suddenly wiped the cold sweat off his forehead. "Fortunately, we listened to Xuan Chu and didn't join forces with the Dark Abyss and the others …"
At this moment, he was indeed afraid!
If they had joined forces with the Dark Abyss and the other forces, it would have brought disaster to the Whirling Sect!
Although the Whirling Sect had a deep foundation, they couldn't withstand the revenge of such a strong expert!
Moreover, most importantly, there was more than one such expert!
Who knew how many more there were?
Xuan Chu looked at Ye Xuan in the distance and didn't say anything.
In the distance, after the white-robed woman had killed those strong ones, she collected all of their souls and then sent them to Ye Xuan. "Absorb!"
Ye Xuan's soul could be said to be extremely weak. The best way to nourish a soul was to use it to nourish it!
At this moment, the souls of these experts were simply great nourishment for the current Ye Xuan!
After Ye Xuan devoured the souls of the Sky Sovereign and the Yin Yang Gods, his soul aura suddenly skyrocketed …
The white-robed woman suddenly turned to look at Su Zhe who was not far away.
Seeing this, Su Zhe hurriedly said, "Greetings, Senior!
We are Young Master Ye's friends! "
The white-robed woman looked at Ye Xuan and Ye Xuan nodded. "Senior Su Zhe and the others have helped me a lot!"
The white-robed woman nodded slightly and looked at Su Zhe. "Thank you!"
Hearing this, Su Zhe trembled. He was slightly flattered by this senior's thanks.
But fortunately, this senior seemed to be reasonable!
As for the white-robed woman, she was really a little unreasonable!
The white-robed woman looked at Yue Zun and the others. Seeing this, the Great Elder hurriedly said, "Sir, we are also good friends with Young Master Ye!"
The white-robed woman retracted her gaze and looked at Ye Xuan. At this moment, Ye Xuan was madly absorbing the souls of those experts!
It was really great nourishment!
Especially since he had the Soul Suppressing Sword!
There wasn't much difference between him and the Soul Suppressing Sword!
The white-robed woman just looked at Ye Xuan, her eyes filled with gentleness.
Actually, she didn't care about anything back then because there was nothing left for her to care about.
During the battle between the white-robed woman and the green-robed man, she didn't choose to help the green-robed man not because she was afraid of the white-robed woman, but because she actually hoped that the white-robed woman could defy the heavens and change her fate.
Among the four of them, the one they owed the most was her brother.
No matter if it was her or the white-robed woman, they would never be able to forget that little boy that had starved to death in the cave.
Right at this moment, Ye Xuan suddenly opened his eyes. He didn't continue absorbing those souls because his soul had returned to normal, and it was better for the Soul Suppressing Sword to absorb the remaining souls!
Ye Xuan looked at the white-robed woman. "Qing 'er!"
The white-robed woman nodded. She walked over to Ye Xuan, and then she took Ye Xuan's hand and said softly, "I'm sorry I'm late!"
Ye Xuan laughed bitterly. "I thought I was dead for sure!"
The white-robed woman gazed at Ye Xuan. "You won't die with me here!"
Ye Xuan said softly, "Qing 'er, you and Qing' er …. Both of you are so strong!
Do you know where she is now? "
The white-robed woman raised her head and looked towards the depths of the starry sky. After a short moment, she shook her head. "She's very, very far away from us!"
Ye Xuan asked, "Is it because of my Misfortune Seed?"
The white-robed woman nodded. "Yes."
Ye Xuan furrowed his brows. "What is it?"
The white-robed woman fell silent for a moment. "It's a very complicated thing!
I don't know if this Misfortune Seed was forced upon you by others, or if it was your own doing. I've been investigating this matter, and I've just made some progress. Then, someone informed me that you're in danger … "
Ye Xuan hurriedly asked, "Who informed you?"
The white-robed woman fell silent.
Ye Xuan was about to ask more questions, but the white-robed woman shook her head. "One day, you'll understand everything."
Ye Xuan hesitated for a moment, then nodded. "Alright!
I won't ask anymore! "
The white-robed woman turned to look at Su Zhe. "Where is the Dark Abyss?"
Hearing this, Su Zhe was stunned for a moment, then he was overjoyed!
Su Zhe hurriedly said, "Senior, I'm willing to lead the way!"
The white-robed woman nodded. "Lead the way!"
As she said this, she looked at Ye Xuan. "Let's go settle the score!"
Ye Xuan was speechless.
Situ Tingyun suddenly asked, "Do you need my help?"
The white-robed woman pulled Ye Xuan's hand and walked away without looking back. "Do you think it's necessary?"

Along with the departure of Ye Xuan and the white-robed woman, the Fifth Dimension suddenly fell silent.
Venerable Yue said softly, "A calamity has descended upon Dark Abyss!"
Xuan Chu said softly, "I'm afraid it isn't just Dark Abyss!"
The corners of Venerable Yue's mouth curled up. "Yes!
However, it's great news for us. "
The Grand Elder suddenly said, "Venerable Yue, if Ye Xuan wants the last scripture of our Swaying Sect, then we …"
Venerable Yue glanced at the Grand Elder. "Wait for him?
Shouldn't we be the ones to give it to him? "
The Grand Elder was speechless.
...
On the other side, the Lord suddenly smiled, "What do you think?"
Behind him, Rahu and the others were silent.
What do they think?
That woman is already invincible!
How do they think?
Chi Yaoyao suddenly smiled, "Shouldn't we rejoice?"
The Lord smiled, "Indeed!"
As he spoke, he looked towards the distance and said softly, "I finally know why Ancestor Daoting chose him!
With such an expert behind him, wouldn't it be extremely easy for him to rebuild order? "
Rahu suddenly said, "Can Dark Abyss stop that senior?"
The Lord replied softly, "I don't think so!
However, Ancestor Dark Abyss isn't a simple figure. How could someone who could create the Dark Abyss be ordinary?
Moreover, the Dark Abyss has existed for so long, and its foundation is far beyond our imagination! "
Chi Yaoyao smiled, "That's not something we should worry about!"
The Lord grinned, "Indeed!"
As if he'd thought of something, he suddenly looked towards Situ Tingyun, "We almost forgot about this senior …"
...
A woman walked over to Situ Tingyun, it was Senior Sister Lu.
Senior Sister Lu smiled and said, "Tingyun!"
Situ Tingyun grinned, "Senior Sister Lu!"
Senior Sister Lu hesitated for a moment before she said, "Do you know anything about him?"
Situ Tingyun shook her head, "I don't."
Senior Sister Lu fell silent.
Situ Tingyun suddenly turned to look at Nian Nian. Nian Nian hurriedly lowered her head when she saw Situ Tingyun looking over.
Situ Tingyun walked over to Nian Nian and smiled, "What's your name?"
Nian Nian said softly, "Nian Nian!"
Situ Tingyun turned around to gaze at Senior Sister Lu. Senior Sister Lu hesitated for a moment before she said, "She's a Fifth Dimension Tendo!"
Tendo!
Situ Tingyun smiled. "Interesting. There's actually such an expert in this universe!"
Senior Sister Lu looked at Situ Tingyun, "Tingyun, can you help her recover her memories?"
Situ Tingyun shook her head.
Senior Sister Lu frowned slightly. "Not either?"
Situ Tingyun smiled and said, "She might have intentionally lost her memories. I believe that she will recover her memories when it's necessary."
Was it intentional?
Senior Sister Lu looked at Nian Nian in silence.
Soon, her expression became complicated.
What kind of person was the Fifth Dimension Tendo?
That was a person whose strength and intelligence were close to that of a demon!
How could such a person lose his memory?
Could she be plotting something again?
At that moment, Situ Tingyun suddenly turned her head. A powerful aura was rapidly approaching the Fifth Dimension's starry space from the Whirling World to the Fifth Dimension.
Another expert from the Whirling World had arrived!
Everyone was looking at the teleportation formation.
It didn't take long for an old man to walk out from within it. He glanced at the surroundings and spoke in a low voice, "Where are they?"
No one answered him!
The old man suddenly gazed at Yue Zun's group, "Yue Zun, where are they!?"
Yue Zun smiled, "So it's the Supreme Elder of the Blackout Sect!"
The old man gazed at Yue Zun, "What exactly happened here!?"
Yue Zun hesitated for a moment before he said, "I want to tell you what happened as well, but I think that you might not believe me!"
The old man stared fixedly at Yue Zun, "Something has happened to them!"
Yue Zun nodded, "Yes!"
The old man's face turned gloomy, "Impossible!"
He seemed to have thought of something, and he glanced coldly at the surroundings. In the end, his gaze descended onto Situ Tingyun, "Who is it!?"
Situ Tingyun smiled, "I can be considered to be Ye Xuan's Senior Sister!"
Ye Xuan!
The old man's eyes narrowed slightly while he slowly clenched his right fist, but he didn't dare attack.
Because the woman before him gave him an extremely dangerous feeling!
In his opinion, this was extremely absurd because he'd already attained the peak of the Consolidation Realm, and there weren't many in this world that could pose a threat to him!
But at this moment, he really did sense danger!
The old man thought for a moment before he relaxed his right hand. He felt that it was better to be cautious and keep a low profile!
He looked at Situ Tingyun, "Where are the members of my Blackout Sect!?"
Situ Tingyun smiled, "They're dead!"
The old man's expression instantly turned cold, "They're dead?
My Blackout Sect has 8 Consolidation Realm experts and a few dozen at the Dao Attainment Realm!
You're saying that they're dead? "
Situ Tingyun nodded, "They're indeed dead!"
The old man laughed from extreme rage, "Dead?
Don't tell me that they were killed! "
Situ Tingyun shook her head, "That's not it!"
The old man pointed angrily at Situ Tingyun, "What a huge joke! Eight Consolidation Realm experts and a few dozen Consolidation Realm experts in total, yet you're saying that they were killed …"
Situ Tingyun suddenly interrupted the old man, "Is the Consolidation Realm very strong?"
The old man was stunned.
Situ Tingyun hesitated for a moment before she said, "I don't mean to offend you, but I feel that it's enough to kill a Consolidation Realm expert with hands, right?"
Everyone, "…"
On the other side, Yue Zun's expression was very unnatural.
The High Lord shook his head and smiled bitterly, "That's too much of a blow!"
In front of Situ Tingyun, the old man suddenly pointed at himself and smiled, "I'm a Consolidation Realm expert. You have hands, and two hands at that. Why don't you try killing me?"
Situ Tingyun blinked, "That's what I said!"
The old man smiled, "That's what I said! …"
At this point, the old man's pupils suddenly constricted because he saw a sword, a very, very ordinary sword. The sword was slightly blurry at first, but it quickly became clear. However, when he saw the sword clearly, it had already pierced his throat.
A sword pierced through his throat!
The old man looked at Situ Tingyun in disbelief, "This …"
Situ Tingyun shrugged. "I was the one who killed him!"
The old man was at a loss, "Why … Why can't I even take a single sword strike …"
Situ Tingyun blinked, "You might be a little weak!"
The old man suddenly roared, "I'm at the peak of the Consolidation Realm!
I'm at the peak of the Consolidation Realm! "
Situ Tingyun hesitated for a moment before she said, "I was wrong!
It's not that you're weak, but that you're very weak at the Consolidation Realm. "
The old man, "…"
On the other side, Lord Yue shook his head, "This woman's words are so infuriating!
I can't take it anymore! "
With that, she turned around and left.
Xuan Chu, "…"
The High Lord shook his head and smiled bitterly, "This senior is speaking … Farewell, farewell!"
With that, he turned around and left.
Luo Hou and the others, "…"
In the distance, the old man in front of Situ Tingyun was at a loss.
At the instant Situ Tingyun attacked, he knew that he'd encountered a true expert!
She was too strong, and he was too weak!
In some places, Consolidation Realm experts were at the top of the pyramid, but in other places, they were like cabbages.
Different environments had different values!
At this moment, Situ Tingyun suddenly looked at Senior Sister Lu, "Senior Sister Lu, let's catch up!"
Senior Sister Lu nodded, "Alright!"
The two women left.
The starry sky returned to peace once more.
...
Somewhere in the starry sky, Ye Xuan was flying on his sword, and the white-robed woman was by his side.
Su Zhe wasn't too far away from them.
At this moment, Su Zhe was extremely excited!
How many years had the Ancient God Abyss and the Dark Abyss been fighting for?
Countless years!
However, both sides hadn't come to a conclusion!
But now, the situation was about to change!
Ye Xuan suddenly looked at the white-robed woman, "Qing 'er, do you know the origin of my bloodline?"
The white-robed woman nodded, "I do!"
Ye Xuan hurriedly asked, "Who am I?"
The white-robed woman hesitated for a moment, and then she said, "I know who your father is, but I don't know your mother. However, I do know that your mother isn't ordinary!"
Dugu Xuan!
Ye Xuan spoke in a low voice, "My mother is Dugu Xuan, but she said she was going to look for someone, and we haven't heard from her since."
The white-robed woman said, "She's very complicated, and I don't know the specifics. However, I do know that she isn't an ordinary person."
Ye Xuan fell silent.
The white-robed woman continued, "Don't think too much about it. What you have to do is live well!"
Ye Xuan spoke softly, "I want to become as strong as you!"
The white-robed woman said, "Time!"
As she spoke, she gazed at Ye Xuan, "That Qing 'er I know has lived for over 200,000 years. If she lived for that long, she would be as strong as you!"
Over 200,000 years!
Ye Xuan was slightly curious, "Qing 'er, are you originally from the three-dimensional universe?"
The white-robed woman nodded, "Yes!"
Ye Xuan was slightly puzzled, "Why are all the people from the three-dimensional universe so terrifying?"
The white-robed woman fell silent for a moment, then said, "In the entire three-dimensional universe, there are only a few special ones!"
Ye Xuan asked again, "Qing 'er, you've been to very far places, do you know how big this universe is?"
The white-robed woman shook her head, "There's no end."
Ye Xuan asked, "Infinite?"
The white-robed woman nodded, "Something like that!"
As she said this, she seemed to have thought of something and said, "There's a place that we have to be careful of."
Ye Xuan asked, "What place?"
The white-robed woman was about to speak when Su Zhe suddenly said, "Senior, we've arrived!"
We've arrived!
Ye Xuan looked up and saw a huge abyss not far away. That abyss was like a pitch-black black hole in the starry sky, deep and mysterious.
The Dark Abyss!
Su Zhe said solemnly, "Senior, this is the Dark Abyss. There's a powerful enchantment around it …"
At this moment, the white-robed woman threw a punch.
Boom!
The huge abyss trembled violently. Immediately after, the boundary around the abyss vanished into thin air.
The white-robed woman looked at the abyss, her face expressionless, "Are you going to commit suicide, or should I kill you?"
Su Zhe was speechless.
....







Chapter 1434
Domineering!
Too domineering!
Su Zhe looked at the white-robed woman. Why was Ye Xuan's sister so domineering?
Right at this moment, the enormous abyss suddenly trembled. In the next moment, an old man walked out from within it.
Su Zhe quickly said, "Senior, this is an elder of An Yuan. His strength is at the peak of the Consolidation Realm!"
The white-robed woman nodded, "You don't need to introduce me to someone who is about to die!"
Su Zhe was speechless.
In the distance, the old man bowed slightly to the white robed woman, "Senior, I, An Yuan, was in the wrong this time. I, An Yuan, am willing to return the two scriptures and apologize to Young Master Ye!"
He admitted defeat!
Obviously, An Yuan already knew about what happened in the Fifth Dimension!
The white-robed woman's mouth curled into a disdainful smile, "Apologize?"
As she said that, she punched out.
Boom!
Before the old man could react, he was directly smashed into pieces by the white-robed woman's punch!
The white-robed woman said, "Brother, apologize to him!"
Ye Xuan was speechless.
Su Zhe had a strange expression on his face.
At this time, another old man came out from the abyss. This old man held a black cane in his hand and looked at the white-robed woman, "Your Excellency, do you really want to be so ruthless?"
The white-robed woman was expressionless, "When you went against my brother, did you think of holding back?"
The old man said in a low voice, "Your Excellency, we already know our mistakes!"
The white-robed woman's expression became ferocious, "Mistakes?
Since you know your mistakes, why don't you die? "
Su Zhe blinked and sweated.
This senior is too scary!
In the distance, the old man stared at the white-robed woman, "Your Excellency, I, An Yuan, am not easy to bully!"
The white-robed woman laughed, "I will bully you right now!"
As she said that, she punched out!
Boom!
The huge abyss in the distance began to shatter!
Seeing this scene, the old man's expression changed. The white-robed woman wanted to destroy the entire Dark Abyss!
The old man quickly said, "Sacrificial array!"
As soon as he finished speaking, the Dark Abyss suddenly trembled violently, and then numerous black blades flew out from within it. Moreover, figures could be seen within these blades!
Ye Xuan's expression turned solemn when he saw this. These giant blades contained extremely powerful energy that could easily tear space apart!
At this time, the white-robed woman punched out.
Boom!
Those huge blades were instantly transformed into nothingness. At the same time, the entire Dark Abyss started to shatter!
In next to no time, numerous shrill cries resounded from within the dark abyss, and then countless people fled from within it!
The old man's countenance instantly turned pale when he witnessed this scene. At this moment, he was truly on the verge of despair!
What kind of person was he?
Why was he so ridiculously powerful!
The white-robed woman was about to attack again, but at this moment, a middle-aged man, who was wearing a white robe, suddenly appeared.
The man suddenly appeared in front of the white-robed woman.
Su Zhe's expression instantly became solemn when he saw this person, and he hurriedly said, "Senior, this person is the current master of the Dark Abyss, and his name is Mo Yuan!"
Mo Yuan looked at the white-robed woman. "Are you from Xuan City?"
The white-robed woman's face was expressionless. Without answering, she directly punched out.
In the distance, Mo Yuan's pupils suddenly shrank. In the next moment, he suddenly rushed forward and also punched out!
The moment he punched out, the space around him directly distorted into a strange shape. At the same time, the surrounding starry sky even cracked inch by inch.
Compared to the white-robed woman's simple punch, the momentum of Mo Yuan's punch could be said to be earth-shattering.
But soon, the power of Mo Yuan's punch began to dissipate inch by inch, like snow meeting boiling oil!
Seeing this scene, Mo Yuan's pupils suddenly shrank. "How … How is this possible …"
As soon as he finished speaking, his entire body disappeared without a trace.
Killed with a single punch!
In the distance, Su Zhe's expression became extremely solemn!
At this moment, his heart was in turmoil, and he was extremely shocked!
He knew that he had seriously underestimated the strength of this senior!
That was Mo Yuan!
The current master of the Dark Abyss had been killed by a punch from the white-robed woman!
Ye Xuan was also a little shocked. Just how strong was this Qing 'er?
The white-robed woman didn't stop. She looked at the shattered Dark Abyss and blasted out another punch!
A fist seal swept out!
If this punch entered the Dark Abyss, the entire Dark Abyss would be turned into nothingness in an instant!
One punch to destroy a world!
However, just as the punch was about to enter the Dark Abyss, a finger seal suddenly flashed out from the Dark Abyss.
Boom!
The white-robed woman's fist seal was directly blocked, but in the next moment, the finger seal directly shattered. The fist seal went straight into the Dark Abyss, but there was no movement!
Not far away, Su Zhe's expression became solemn!
He knew that the true expert of the Dark Abyss had appeared!
Could it be the Second Elder of the Dark Abyss?
The white-robed woman looked at the Dark Abyss with a calm expression.
At this moment, an old man walked out of the Dark Abyss. The old man's back was a little heavy, and his hair was white. He looked particularly weak.
Su Zhe frowned because he didn't know the old man at all.
The hunchbacked old man gazed at the white-robed woman, and a trace of a complicated expression flashed through his eyes, "I never expected that the Dark Abyss would suffer such a calamity today!"
The white-robed woman clenched her right fist slowly.
Meanwhile, the hunchbacked old man suddenly said, "Senior, I, An Yuan, am willing to submit to Young Master Ye. I wonder if Senior can spare my life?"
The white-robed woman turned to look at Ye Xuan.
Meanwhile, the hunchbacked old man hurriedly added, "Young Master Ye, if you're willing to show mercy, I, An Yuan, will follow Young Master Ye forever …."
Ye Xuan smiled, "I don't need it!"
The hunchbacked old man was stunned.
Su Zhe was stunned as well. He'd thought that Ye Xuan would agree. After all, the entire Dark Abyss submitting to him was extremely tempting!
After all, Ye Xuan had subdued the Daoting as well.
And the Dark Abyss was even more powerful than the Daoting!
The hunchbacked old man looked at Ye Xuan, "Young Master Ye, this old man doesn't understand!
As far as I know, didn't you give the Daoting a chance?
Why can't you give it to me … "
Ye Xuan shook his head, "When the Daoting Ancestor made me the Daoting Master, the Daoting was stronger than me, Ye Xuan. The Daoting Ancestor's strength was enough to crush me. But now, you chose to submit not because you want to submit, but because you want to live.
The difference is huge! "
The hunchbacked old man was stunned, and just as he was about to speak, the white-robed woman suddenly said angrily, "My brother said there's no need!
You don't understand, do you? "
As soon as she finished speaking, she punched out!
Boom!
Before the hunchbacked old man could finish his words, his entire body turned into a wisp of green smoke and disappeared without a trace.
He was directly erased!
It was obvious that the white-robed woman had used a bit of strength in that punch!
After killing the hunchbacked old man with a single punch, the white-robed woman looked at the shattered Dark Abyss, and in the next moment, she punched out!
A fist swept through the battlefield, and the space in its path was annihilated inch by inch. It was an extremely shocking sight.
If this fist entered the Dark Abyss, the entire Dark Abyss would be instantly turned into nothingness!
Just as the fist was about to enter the Dark Abyss, a shadow suddenly appeared at the entrance of the Dark Abyss, and the shadow flicked his sleeve.
Boom!
The white-robed woman's fist was instantly blocked by a mysterious force!
Su Zhe's voice trembled as he spoke from afar, "Dao Brother!"
The shadow before them was the Ancestor of the Dark Abyss, Dao Brother. However, it wasn't his true body, it was just a shadow!
Dao Brother!
He was one of the disciples of the previous owner of the Dao Scripture!
Moreover, he had created the Dark Abyss!
Dao Brother looked at the white-robed woman in the distance, and he just looked at her without saying a word. After that, his body started to dissipate bit by bit.
Su Zhe frowned slightly when he saw this. What does this mean?
Just like that, the Dao Brother slowly disappeared in front of the three of them.
Ye Xuan was silent.
What did she mean by this?
At this moment, the white-robed woman waved her right hand, and two rays of white light suddenly flew out from the Dark Abyss and landed steadily in her hands.
Dao Scripture!
Two Dao Scriptures!
Ye Xuan was about to speak, but the white-robed woman suddenly punched out!
Boom!
In the distance, the entire Dark Abyss was directly turned into nothingness!
Completely wiped out!
Seeing this scene, Su Zhe's heart was filled with mixed feelings.
The Dark Abyss and the Ancient God Abyss had been fighting for so many years, but now, this force had completely disappeared.
At this moment, the white-robed woman suddenly said, "Let's go!"
Su Zhe hurriedly asked, "Back to the Fifth Dimension?"
The white-robed woman nodded.
Su Zhe was about to speak, but the white-robed woman said again, "Then go to the Whirling World!"
Go to the Whirling World!
Su Zhe was stunned.
This senior still didn't want to give up?
At this moment, the white-robed woman suddenly said, "Let's go!"
As she said this, she pulled Ye Xuan and turned to leave.
Su Zhe hesitated for a moment, then followed.
...
Whirling World.
Somewhere in the clouds, the clouds suddenly trembled. Soon, four experts appeared above the clouds.
These four people were the Xuanhuan Sect's Sect Master Li Shanshui, the Xuanji Sect's Sect Master Gu Wuchao, the Dao Returning Academy's Sect Master Yun Min, and the Xiao clan's Patriarch Xiao Jing!
Xuanhuan Sect's Sect Master Li Shanshui suddenly said, "I think everyone should know that something has happened to the Fifth Dimension!"
Gu Wuchao said in a deep voice, "I can no longer contact the people of my Xuanji Sect!"
Dao Returning Academy's Sect Master Yun Min said softly, "Me too!"
Xiao Jing also said, "My Xiao clan too!"
Xuanhuan Sect's Sect Master Li Shanshui suddenly said, "They might all be dead!"
Hearing this, the expressions of everyone present changed.
Li Shanshui said softly, "Everyone, this time, we might have kicked an iron plate!"
Xiao Jing looked at Li Shanshui. "No one should be able to destroy them over there!"
Li Shanshui said in a deep voice, "We might have underestimated the force behind that Ye Xuan!"
Everyone fell silent!
The force behind Ye Xuan!
Why had they sent so many experts to the Fifth Dimension this time?
They wanted to destroy the force behind Ye Xuan, seize the Dao Scripture, and divide the Fifth Dimension.
But now, all the people they had sent were gone!
Li Shanshui suddenly said, "Everyone, the people behind Ye Xuan will definitely not let this go."
Xiao Jing said in a deep voice, "In Brother Li's opinion, what should we do next?"
A cold light flashed in Li Shanshui's eyes. "We can't sit still and wait for death. We must strike first to gain the upper hand."
As he said this, he looked at everyone. "Everyone, this time, we must work together and unite as one!
I have already asked all the experts of my Xuan Fei Sect to rush back. Not only that, I have also invited some of the elders who are in seclusion … All the experts of my Xuan Fei Sect have rushed to the transmission array here … Everyone, I hope that you can do the same. Don't think that you will get lucky. The other party was able to destroy so many of us, so they must have a lot of people. None of our four clans can contend against them. Only when the four clans unite as one will we have a chance! "
After the other three were silent for a moment, Xiao Jing suddenly said, "I will immediately ask all the experts of my Xiao clan to rush here!"
Dao Returning Academy Master Yun Min also said, "The people of my Dao Returning Academy will arrive here in an hour at most!"
Xuanji Sect Master Gu Wuchao said, "Within an hour, all the experts of my Xuanji Sect who are at or above the Dao Attainment Realm will appear here!"
Soon, countless experts of the entire Whirling World rushed towards the transmission array that led to the Fifth Dimension.
More and more people came because there were many vassal forces under the four super forces …

Chapter 1435
Under the call of the four major forces, more and more forces from the Saha World began to join them.
However, the Whirling Sect, which had the greatest influence in the Whirling World, did not make any moves.
Whirling Sect.
In a certain pavilion, two women sat facing each other.
One of the women was Yue Zun, who had rushed back from the Fifth Dimension.
The other woman was the current Sect Master of the Whirling Sect, Yue Xi!
The two of them were playing chess.
Yue Xi raised a piece and placed it down, "Is what you said true?"
Venerable Yue laughed, "Senior Sister, do you think I would lie to you?"
Yue Xi shook her head, her eyes flashed a trace of complexity, "I just can't believe that there is such a strong person in this world!"
Venerable Yue said in a low voice, "I didn't believe it in the beginning either!"
Yue Xi shook his head and smiled, "It seems that our vision is too narrow!
In other words, the Whirling World has limited us! "
Yue Zun raised a chess piece and placed it down. Then, he said, "Senior sister, have you considered it?"
Yue Xi chuckled and said, "What's there to consider?
Exchanging a Daoist scripture for a good karma, no matter how you look at it, it's our gain! "
Venerable Yue smiled and said, "Indeed!"
Yue Xi turned his head and took a look, "Now more and more experts from the Whirling World are rushing to that teleportation array. It seems that Xuan Huan Sect wants to fight to the death!"
Venerable Yue shook his head, "A mantis trying to stop a chariot!"
In her opinion, numbers meant nothing to a powerhouse at the level of the white-robed woman!
Most importantly, there was also a female Swordsman!
That female Swordsman was also terrifying!
If the two of them joined forces, they could even shatter the Whirling World, let alone destroy the Mystic Nebulous Sect and other forces!
At that moment, an old man suddenly appeared behind the two women. The old man bowed slightly and said, "Sect Master, Sect Master Li Shanshui of the Profound Nether Sect has come to visit. Do you want to see him?"
Hearing this, Yue Xi looked at Yue Zun and said with a smile, "Why do you think he came here?"
Venerable Yue spoke indifferently, "He wants us to join forces with him!"
Yue Xi smiled and said, "Yes!"
The old man bowed slightly and then quietly retreated.
A moment later, Li Shanshui appeared in front of the two women.
Yue Xi stood up and said with a smile, "Brother Li, why are you free to come to my Whirling Sect today?"
Li Shanshui smiled and said, "Sect Master Yue, to tell you the truth, I came this time because I have something to ask of you!"
Yue Xi rolled his eyes at Li Shanshui, "Brother Li, what do you mean by begging? You're treating me like an outsider!
What's the matter, Brother Li, just say it. "
Li Shanshui looked at Yue Xi, "Sect Leader Yue, I think you should already know what happened in the Fifth Dimension!"
Yue Xi blinked, "What is it?"
Li Shanshui's expression was calm. Damn, this woman is playing dumb!
Li Shanshui smiled slightly, "Sect Leader Yue, I will be straightforward!
We underestimated the power behind Ye Xuan in the Fifth Dimension. This time, we want the Whirling Sect to join us. If Sect Leader Yue agrees, after we kill Ye Xuan, all the Dao Scriptures on him will belong to the Whirling Sect! "
Yue Zun glanced at Li Shanshui. Needless to say, Li Shanshui's conditions were very tempting.
After all, if the Whirling Sect obtained the Taoist scriptures from Ye Xuan, they would have a total of seven Taoist scriptures!
Of course, not to mention seven Daoist scriptures, the Whirling Sect wouldn't even be tempted by nine Daoist scriptures!
They didn't dare to be tempted!
Yue Xi smiled, "Sect Leader Li, this condition is very tempting … However, Sect Leader Li, I will tell you the truth. This time, we won't interfere in the matter between you and the Fifth Dimension!"
Li Shanshui frowned, "Why?"
Yue Xi smiled slightly, "Sect Leader Li, forgive me for speaking bluntly, but why should we interfere?"
Li Shanshui was silent.
Yue Xi continued, "Sect Leader Li, if you obtain the Taoist scriptures from Ye Xuan, my Whirling Sect won't be jealous."
Li Shanshui glanced at Yue Xi and said, "Farewell!"
With that, he turned and left.
After Li Shanshui left, Yue Zun suddenly said, "Actually, if they go to the Fifth Dimension now, they can still be saved!"
Yue Xi looked at Yue Zun, "How?"
Yue Zun smiled, "Admit your mistake and beg for mercy."
Yue Xi smiled, "They won't!"
Yue Zun nodded. As if thinking of something, she suddenly looked at Yue Xi, "Senior Sister, why didn't you tell him about the true strength of the person behind Ye Xuan?"
Yue Xi blinked, "He didn't ask!"
Yue Zun gave a thumbs up, "No wonder Master passed the position of Sect Leader to you!
Amazing! "
Yue Xi smiled, "If you want, I can give it to you right now!"
Yue Zun stood up and walked over to Yue Xi, "Senior Sister, if I had the intention to fight for the position of Sect Leader, would you have let me go?"
Yue Xi grabbed Yue Zun's hand and smiled lightly, "Am I that bad in your heart?"
Yue Zun smiled, "Even now, I still can't see through you!"
Yue Xi looked at Yue Zun, "After I took over the Whirling Sect, have I harmed anyone?"
Yue Zun was silent for a moment, then smiled, "I was thinking too much!"
With that, she turned and left.
On the spot, Yue Xi said softly, "Silly girl …"
...
Somewhere in the clouds, more and more experts were gathering here. They were experts from all over the world.
And they were all summoned by Xuanhuan Sect and other forces!
The experts of the Xuanhuan Sect and other forces had also arrived. At this moment, there were sixty-nine Consolidation Realm experts gathered here. In addition, there were more than three hundred Dao Attainment Realm experts and thousands of Dao Defense Realm experts!
It seemed like a lot, but it was actually normal, because most of the top experts in the Whirling World were here!
In the Five-Dimensional Universe.
After Ye Xuan and the white-robed woman returned to the Five-Dimensional Universe, they did not stop. Instead, they directly went to the teleportation formation to the Whirling World.
The white-robed woman glanced at Su Zhe in the distance, "You can stay here!"
Su Zhe hesitated for a moment, then nodded, "Okay!"
The white-robed woman nodded slightly, then led Ye Xuan towards the teleportation formation. At this moment, a voice suddenly came from behind them, "Count me in!"
Ye Xuan turned around and saw that the person who spoke was Situ Tingyun.
The white-robed woman said, "I alone am enough!"
Situ Tingyun smiled, "I want to join in the fun!"
The white-robed woman was about to speak when Ye Xuan suddenly said, "Then let's go together!"
Situ Tingyun smiled, "Then let's go!"
After saying that, she turned into a sword light and entered the teleportation formation.
The white-robed woman and Ye Xuan disappeared on the spot.
...
In the teleportation formation passage, Ye Xuan looked at Situ Tingyun, "Senior Sister, I would like to ask you for advice on Sword Dao!"
"Sword Dao!"
Situ Tingyun blinked, then smiled, "The person beside you is also a Swordsman!
And a powerful Swordsman! "
Ye Xuan looked at the white-robed woman, "Qing 'er … Are you a sword and fist cultivator?"
The white-robed woman nodded, "Sort of."
Ye Xuan hurriedly said, "Then can you provide me with some guidance in Sword Dao?"
The white-robed woman glanced at Ye Xuan, and then she said, "Your current Sword Dao already has a flavor of its own. However, it's still very, very lacking in terms of intent!"
Ye Xuan nodded, "Yes!
Is there any way to improve it? "
The white-robed woman thought for a moment, and then she said, "I can point you in a direction. As for whether you're able to improve it, that's up to you!"
Ye Xuan nodded, "Alright!"
The white-robed woman said, "Your current comprehension of the Sword Dao has attained the level of the unrestrained Sword Heart. What is the unrestrained Sword Heart?
It's when the sword isn't restrained by yourself or anything else. However, your sword hasn't attained true freedom. What is freedom?
It's freedom that comes naturally from not attaining it. You're far from attaining that level right now!
The reason you're unable to attain that level is because you have too many trivial matters and too many burdens. There's an invisible shackle in your heart, and it's preventing you from attaining true freedom. "
Ye Xuan fell silent.
He understood what the white-robed woman meant. Because of the matter regarding the Fifth Dimension, he was utterly unable to attain true freedom in the Sword Heart!
Ye Xuan asked another question. "Qing 'er, then what about the level above the unrestrained Sword Heart?"
The white-robed woman gazed at Ye Xuan and said, "I can't tell you that!"
Ye Xuan was slightly puzzled, "Why?"
The white-robed woman spoke softly, "You've already created your own path in the Sword Dao!
You can only explore this path on your own. Do you understand what I mean? "
Ye Xuan fell silent.
The white-robed woman continued, "If you continue on this path, then your Sword Dao will truly create a path that truly belongs to you. At that time, you'll become someone that isn't within your realm of cultivation!
As for our path in the Sword Dao, even though you can walk it as well, there's no need for you to! "
Ye Xuan nodded slightly, "I understand!"
The white-robed woman glanced at Situ Tingyun in the distance and said, "Her Sword Dao was also created by her own!"
Situ Tingyun nodded. "Regardless of whether it's the Sword Dao or any other path, it's best to walk one's own path. Even though it's much simpler to walk someone else's path, there are too many limitations."
As she spoke, she smiled faintly. "In our eyes, there are only two types of people in this world. One is within the realm of cultivation, and the other is outside the realm of cultivation!
Those within the realm of cultivation are equivalent to what the Milky Way Realm calls the novice village. Those outside the realm of cultivation are the true experts. "
Ye Xuan blinked. "What's the meaning of novice village?"
Situ Tingyun smiled and said, "It means that they're very, very weak!"
Ye Xuan was speechless.
Situ Tingyun continued, "Of course, the owner of this scripture is considered an expert. However, those who walk his path are not. Unless one surpasses him, one can only be considered to be unconventional!"
Unconventional!
Ye Xuan said in a low voice, "Is the owner of this scripture very formidable?"
Situ Tingyun smiled and said, "I've never seen him. However, he was able to create a complete martial arts system, so he's definitely a genius amongst geniuses. Such a person is rare in this world."
The white-robed woman nodded. "This scripture's martial arts system is not bad indeed. As for the owner of this scripture, I've never seen him before, so I won't comment on him."
Ye Xuan suddenly asked, "What about the woman in the plain dress?
How strong is she? "
Situ Tingyun fell silent.
The white-robed woman fell silent as well.
Ye Xuan glanced at the two of them and said softly, "Both of you should know, right?"
Situ Tingyun gazed at the white-robed woman. "Ask her!"
Ye Xuan gazed at the white-robed woman. The latter fell silent for a moment before she said, "Let's change the topic!"
Ye Xuan was speechless.
...







Chapter 1436
Ye Xuan glanced at the white robed woman. Obviously, she didn't want to talk about the Qing 'er.
What exactly happened during her generation?
Why did only two out of the four Qing 'er remain in the end?
Ye Xuan was quite curious.
However, he didn't ask any further.
Suddenly, the three of them stopped moving because an old man had suddenly appeared not too far away from them.
The white robed woman gazed at the old man with a calm expression and indifference in her eyes.
The old man's gaze descended onto Ye Xuan, "You're Ye Xuan!"
Ye Xuan nodded.
The old man glanced at the white robed woman and Situ Tingyun, and then he smiled, "What? You've only brought two people with you?"
Ye Xuan nodded.
The old man laughed with ridicule, "Ye Xuan, who are you looking down on?"
Ye Xuan was speechless.
The old man sized up the white robed woman and Situ Tingyun again, and then he smiled, "Ye Xuan, don't you think you've brought too few people with you?"
Ye Xuan thought for a while. Then he said, "Yes, it is a little too little!"
The old man was about to speak when Situ Tingyun suddenly said, "All of you seem to have been waiting for us?"
The old man gazed at Situ Tingyun, "We've been waiting for a long time!"
Situ Tingyun blinked, "Err … then lead the way!"
The old man glanced at Ye Xuan's group of three, "Come on then!
We've prepared a huge gift for all of you. I hope you like it! "
He turned around and left once he finished speaking.
Situ Tingyun hesitated for a moment, "I'm a little panicked!"
Ye Xuan was speechless.
The white robed woman glanced at Situ Tingyun, "You've learned quite a bit from him!"
As soon as she finished speaking, she led Ye Xuan off into the distance.
Situ Tingyun chuckled, and then she followed after them.
...
Whirling World. At this moment, a few thousand people had gathered at the teleportation formation!
There were a total of 98 Consolidation Realm experts amongst them!
Moreover, there were over 500 Dao Attainment Realm experts!
Among them, there were thousands of Dao Defense Realm experts!
The Xuanhuan Sect and the other three super forces had used all the resources they could!
This time, they were serious.
And they didn't dare to underestimate him!
The fall of dozens of Consolidation Realm experts made them realize that they were definitely not facing an ordinary force!
At that moment, an old man walked out from the teleportation formation.
Not far away, Li Shanshui, the sect master of the Mystic Fraudulent Sect, opened his eyes and looked at the elder. The elder said solemnly, "They're here!"
Li Shanshui narrowed his eyes. "How many?"
The old man said, "Including Ye Xuan, that makes three!"
Three people!
Everyone was stunned when they heard this.
Li Shanshui frowned. "Are you sure there are only three of them?"
The old man nodded. "Just three!
However, the aura of those two women is very calm. I'm afraid they're not ordinary people! "
Three people!
Li Shanshui looked at the entrance of the teleportation array with a hint of doubt in his eyes.
Ye Xuan only brought two women to the Saha World?
Was he confident, or did he have a backup plan?
The Xiao Clan's Patriarch, Xiao Jing, spoke abruptly, "It isn't that simple!"
The Dao Convergence Dean, Yun Min, nodded. "Yes, we can't be careless!"
Li Shanshui gazed at the teleportation formation, "Then let's see how extraordinary they are!"
As he spoke, he closed his eyes slowly.
Actually, there was a trace of uneasiness in his heart.
It was absolutely impossible for Ye Xuan to have no backup plan. Or perhaps, it could be said that those two women were absolutely not ordinary people!
But at this moment, they had no way out!
They couldn't beg for mercy from Ye Xuan, right?
He couldn't do something like that!
Two women gazed silently at Li Shanshui's group from high up in the clouds.
They were Yue Zun and Yue Xi!
Yue Xi smiled, "Junior Sister, looks like Li Shanshui and the others are prepared to fight to the death!"
Yue Zun spoke softly, "Let's just watch in silence!"
Yue Xi gazed at Yue Zun, "Do you know that if Ye Xuan loses, then all of these powers will turn against my Saha Sect!?"
Yue Zun fell silent.
If Ye Xuan lost, then Li Shanshui would definitely utilize this opportunity to annihilate the Saha Sect!
Yue Xi was just about to speak when the teleportation formation in the distance suddenly started trembling.
Both of them gazed at the teleportation formation.
The gazes of everyone here descended onto the teleportation formation, and it didn't take long for three people to walk out from it!
Two women and a man.
It was Ye Xuan's group of three!
When Ye Xuan walked out from the teleportation formation, he was instantly stunned. Isn't there a little too many people here?
Moreover, there are actually so many experts here!
The Xiao Clan's Patriarch suddenly walked over to Ye Xuan's group of three, and he gazed at Ye Xuan, "You're Ye Xuan!"
Ye Xuan nodded.
Xiao Jing smiled, "Young Master Ye, we underestimated you!
I never expected that such an enormous power would actually stand behind you! "
As he spoke, he glanced at the white robed woman and Situ Tingyun, "However, aren't you looking down on the experts of my Saha World a little too much by only bringing two people with you?"
Meanwhile, the white robed woman suddenly shook her head, "You talk too much!"
As soon as she finished speaking, she suddenly vanished on the spot.
Xiao Jing's pupils constricted, and then he suddenly smashed his fist forward.
Bang!
The spectators hadn't even been able to see it clearly when a figure was blasted flying. It was Li Shanshui!
Li Shanshui frantically retreated. In the process of retreating, his physical body cracked inch by inch and his soul gradually dissipated. When he finally stopped, his physical body had already disappeared and his soul was almost transparent!
Everyone in the surroundings was petrified when they witnessed this scene.
The Patriarch of the Xiao Clan is gone just like that?
At this moment, Li Shanshui's countenance was pale while his eyes were filled with disbelief!
He hadn't imagined that the Patriarch of the Xiao Clan would be instantly annihilated with a single punch!
At this moment, all the experts of the Saha Sect were terrified!
This wasn't victory, it was instant annihilation!
He'd instantly annihilated a peak Unity Realm expert with a single punch!
On the other side, Yue Xi's expression instantly became solemn as well!
At this moment, she finally understood why her Junior Sister was so afraid of the Fifth Dimension!
This woman was too strong!
The white robed woman gazed at Li Shanshui from afar. Li Shanshui's expression changed, and he said ferociously, "Everyone, attack together!"
As soon as he finished speaking, the experts of the Black Illusion Sect charged forward.
The experts of the other sects were about to attack as well. Right at this moment, the white robed woman smashed her fist forward.
Bang!
All the experts of the Black Illusion Sect that were charging towards her were instantly annihilated by a single punch!
Over 100 Dao Attainment Realm experts and over a dozen Unity Realm experts had been instantly annihilated with a single punch!
At this moment, the surroundings were so silent that a falling needle could be heard!
So many experts had been instantly annihilated just like that!
Everyone looked at the white robed woman as if they were looking at a monster.
On the other side, Yue Xi's expression was extremely solemn as well. She stared fixedly at the white robed woman, and the shock in her heart couldn't be any greater!
What sort of godly strength is this?
In the distance, the white robed woman gazed at Li Shanshui. Li Shanshui gulped and spoke with a trembling voice, "Senior … this is a misunderstanding!"
Everyone was speechless.
The white robed woman was expressionless. "What misunderstanding?"
Li Shanshui's lips moved, but he didn't know what to say.
At this moment, the Dao Returning Academy's Dean, Yun Min, suddenly walked in front of the white robed woman and bowed respectfully. "Senior, we are here today to welcome Young Master Ye and you."
Everyone was speechless.
Yun Min bowed again and said, "Senior, if we have offended you before, please …"
The white robed woman suddenly opened her palm, and the Dao Scripture on Ye Xuan's body flew into her hand. She looked at Li Shanshui and the others. "This is the Dao Scripture that my brother obtained. Don't you want his Dao Scripture?
It's here now. Come and get it! "
Yun Min said with a trembling voice, "No … I wouldn't dare!"
The white robed woman's mouth curled into a disdainful smile. "Wouldn't dare?
You forced my brother to almost self-destruct!
Still wouldn't dare? "
As soon as she finished speaking, she blasted out a punch!
Bang!
Yun Min's entire body was annihilated by this punch!
He didn't even have a chance to fight back!
The expressions of everyone here changed drastically when they witnessed this scene, and they immediately fled. Meanwhile, the white robed woman suddenly spoke fiercely, "Did I say that all of you could leave?"
As she spoke, she smashed her fist forward, and an expert that was over 1km away was instantly obliterated by this punch!
Everyone had stopped what they were doing!
They didn't dare to move!
The white robed woman glanced coldly at them. "Do you want to live?"
Everyone was stunned, and then they hurriedly nodded.
The white robed woman gazed at Li Shanshui. "What about you?"
Li Shanshui spoke with a trembling voice. "I do …"
Don't beg for mercy?
No!
It isn't shameful to beg for mercy when facing such an expert!
The white robed woman's face was expressionless. She glanced at Ye Xuan and said, "This is my brother!"
Everyone looked at Ye Xuan.
The white robed woman continued, "He's from the Ninth Dimension!
He's the master of the Ninth Dimension, and he's reincarnated here to play! "
Ye Xuan was speechless.
Everyone glanced at each other.
The Ninth Dimension?
Does the Ninth Dimension really exist?
The white robed woman continued, "If you want to live, it's very simple. Follow my brother!
In the future, he'll take you to the Ninth Dimension to play! "
Ye Xuan was speechless.
Everyone was speechless.
Li Shanshui's expression was somewhat strange. Why does it seem like this senior is tricking us?
The white robed woman frowned slightly. "What, you don't believe me?"
Hearing this, Li Shanshui hurriedly said, "I believe, of course I believe!"
Everyone else nodded hurriedly.
The white robed woman's face was expressionless. "Is it a grievance to follow my brother?"
Li Shanshui hurriedly shook his head. "No!
It's not grievance!
It's our honor to follow Young Master Ye. "
The white robed woman was silent, and no one knew what she was thinking.
Afraid that the white robed woman would go back on her words, Li Shanshui hurriedly came before Ye Xuan and bowed respectfully to Ye Xuan. "Young Master Ye, from now on, we are your people!"
Ye Xuan ignored Li Shanshui. He walked to the white robed woman's side and said softly, "Qing 'er …"
The white robed woman slowly closed her eyes. "Brother, I'm leaving!"
Ye Xuan frowned slightly. "Leaving?"
The white robed woman nodded. She opened her palm, and a blood-red thread suddenly appeared on her hand.
Ye Xuan was stunned. "This is?"
The white robed woman looked at Ye Xuan. "The cause of calamity!"
Ye Xuan said solemnly, "What do you mean?"
The white robed woman raised her head and looked into the depths of the starry sky. There was a trace of confusion in her eyes. "I underestimated this cause of calamity!"
Ye Xuan was silent.
At this moment, he thought of Nian Nian!
Was Nian Nian's death really related to the Dao Ancestor?
With Nian Nian's strength, even if it was less than 20%, it should be enough to kill the Dao Ancestor!
Moreover, Nian Nian lost her memory!
This was very unusual!
At this moment, a powerful aura suddenly appeared in the distant sky.
Everyone in the surroundings looked up into the sky!
Li Shanshui gazed at Gu Wuchao with slight astonishment, "What're you doing?"
Gu Wuchao laughed fiercely, "She wants us to follow Ye Xuan?
She's probably overthinking things! "
As he spoke, he bowed deeply towards the sky. "Greetings, Ancestor!"
As soon as he finished speaking, a figure gradually condensed in the sky, and it wasn't long before a white haired old man appeared within their fields of vision.
The Profound Sect's Ancestor!
The white haired old man glanced at the surroundings, and then he gazed at Gu Wuchao in the end. "Has my Profound Sect encountered a threat of life and death?"
Gu Wuchao nodded and spoke respectfully, "Yes!"
As he spoke, he pointed at the white robed woman in the distance. "Ancestor, it's her who intends to destroy my Profound Sect!"
The white haired old man gazed at the white robed woman. The white robed woman's expression was calm.
The white robed old man seemed to have noticed something, and his pupils constricted. He turned around to look at Gu Wuchao and roared furiously, "You idiot! How could you screw over your ancestors like this?
I'll fuck your ancestors! "
Everyone in the surroundings was speechless.
....
PS: Do you have tickets?







Chapter 1437
Gu Wuchao was quite stunned.
What's going on?
The white haired old man cupped his fists to the white robed woman and said respectfully, "May I know your name, Senior?"
Senior?
Everyone here was petrified when they heard the white haired old man!
The ancestor of the Dark Secrets Sect actually addressed the white robed woman as Senior?
At this moment, Li Shanshui was covered in cold sweat!
Because he'd actually wanted to summon his ancestor as well!
That was the final trump card of the Dark Secrets Sect!
However, he'd hesitated because he wasn't sure if his ancestor could resist the white robed woman!
But he hadn't expected that Gu Wuchao would summon his ancestor!
Fortunately, Gu Wuchao had summoned his ancestor!
Otherwise, he would be finished!
The white robed woman gazed at the white haired old man, "Are you not going to lend a hand?"
The white haired old man hurriedly shook his head, "Of course not! Of course not!"
The white robed woman's face was emotionless as she gazed at Gu Wuchao. The latter's expression changed, and he hurriedly bowed respectfully, "We're willing to follow Young Master Ye to the death!"
The white robed woman paid no attention to Gu Wuchao, and she gazed at Ye Xuan, "Come with me!"
Ye Xuan nodded, "Alright!"
The white robed woman turned around and left.
Ye Xuan followed her.
Situ Tingyun glanced at the others here, and they were looking at her as well.
Situ Tingyun blinked, "Does anyone want to spar with me?"
All of them were speechless.
...
At the other side.
Ye Xuan and the white robed woman were strolling through the clouds.
The white robed woman said, "I have to go!"
Ye Xuan spoke in a low voice, "Qing 'er, do you know much about the Cause of Calamity?"
The white robed woman shook her head, "Not much!"
She paused for a moment and continued, "I've been constantly investigating the Cause of Calamity throughout the years, and I've made some progress. I'll get to the bottom of it once I leave!"
Ye Xuan spoke in a low voice, "Why can't I sense the Cause of Calamity within me?"
The white robed woman gazed at Ye Xuan, "Because you're not strong enough!"
Ye Xuan was speechless.
The white-robed woman said softly, "The cause of the calamity is mainly this cause. Everything in the world has a cause and an effect. We don't know how this cause was formed."
As she spoke, she looked up at the starry sky and said softly, "People living in this world are like chess pieces on a chessboard!
Of course, the chess player might also be a chess piece … Fate is like an invisible hand that controls everything in the world! "
Ye Xuan smiled bitterly. "Am I that chess piece?"
The white-robed woman looked at Ye Xuan. She grabbed Ye Xuan's hand and said softly, "This universe is boundless, and there are too many unknowns.
Look at this starry sky. There are countless galaxies and planets. These galaxies and planets are all moving confidently according to some kind of law … How could all of this be a coincidence?
If it wasn't a coincidence, then who created all of this?
Both you and I could be pawns.
Even the three of them didn't dare to say that they were invincible in the universe.
”
Ye Xuan fell silent.
The white-robed woman continued, "I'm going to leave this place and investigate the cause of your calamity. You have to take care of yourself from now on, understand?"
Ye Xuan looked at the white-robed woman. "Will there be any danger?"
The white-robed woman shook her head. "I don't know!"
Ye Xuan was just about to say something when the white-robed woman said with a smile, "I can protect myself!"
She gently hugged Ye Xuan as she spoke.
Ye Xuan's body stiffened.
Ye Xuan didn't notice that two streams of clear liquid had appeared on the white-robed woman's cheeks.
After a long while, the white-robed woman released Ye Xuan. She pulled out a storage ring and placed it in Ye Xuan's hand with a faint smile. "There's still time!"
She pointed a finger toward the sky as she spoke.
Chi!
The space in the sky suddenly cracked open. Immediately afterward, she transformed into a streak of white light and disappeared into the cracked space.
Gone!
Down below, Ye Xuan's gaze was slightly blank.
The white-robed woman stopped somewhere in the starry sky. She looked at her palm, and there were already two bloody marks on it.
The white-robed woman's expression was cold, and no one knew what she was thinking.
Moments later, she suddenly turned and looked down. After a long moment of silence, she transformed into a streak of white light and disappeared into the starry sky.
...
The Whirling World.
Ye Xuan returned to the teleportation portal. Situ Tingyun looked at Ye Xuan. "She left?"
Ye Xuan nodded.
Situ Tingyun smiled. "Then I'm leaving as well!"
Ye Xuan looked at Situ Tingyun. "Senior Sister, where are you going?"
Situ Tingyun laughed. "I'm going to find a place that makes me feel threatened!"
Ye Xuan: "…"
Situ Tingyun walked over to Ye Xuan and patted Ye Xuan on the shoulder. "Little Junior Brother, we'll meet again!"
As soon as she finished speaking, she was about to leave. However, she seemed to have thought of something, and she suddenly gazed at the ancestor of the School of Secrets in the sky. The latter's expression changed. "Sir?"
Situ Tingyun smiled, "Don't be nervous. I don't kill people indiscriminately!"
The old man was speechless.
Situ Tingyun continued, "I want to show my ability before I leave, and you're the strongest here. So, make your move!"
The white haired old man hesitated for a moment before he said, "I can't defeat you!"
Situ Tingyun rolled her eyes. "I didn't say that you can defeat me. I just asked you to make your move, and then I'll show my ability."
The white haired old man was speechless.
Situ Tingyun continued, "Make your move quickly!
I'm busy!
Right, remember to use your full strength! "
The white haired old man glanced at Situ Tingyun. "Then I'll have to offend you!"
As soon as he finished speaking, he suddenly opened his palm. In the next moment, he suddenly slapped it towards Situ Tingyun.
Bang!
A palm swept down from the sky. As soon as it appeared, the expressions of countless experts in the surroundings changed drastically, and they retreated explosively. Because the energy contained within that palm was truly too terrifying!
At this moment, Ye Xuan's expression had become solemn as well!
That palm had definitely surpassed the Perfect Union Realm.
The white haired old man stared fixedly at Situ Tingyun.
Actually, he wanted to witness her strength as well.
At this moment, everyone in the surroundings was looking at Situ Tingyun as well.
The corners of Situ Tingyun's mouth curled up slightly. Her left thumb twitched slightly, and then a sword suddenly flew out from within its sheath. In the next moment, a ray of light flashed from below, and then a sword was pressed against the white haired old man's throat.
On the other hand, the white haired old man's attack had vanished without a trace!
Everyone in the surroundings was stunned when they witnessed this scene.
Gu Wuchao's legs even felt slightly weak.
At this moment, he finally understood why his ancestor had been so terrified!
It was too fucking terrifying!
The white haired old man gazed at Situ Tingyun with a complicated expression, "Senior's Sword Dao is unparalleled throughout the ages!"
Situ Tingyun roared with laughter, and then she gazed at Ye Xuan and smiled, "That attack from before is called Instant Death. Every strike of my sword kills an enemy within a 3km radius. I've once utilized this sword technique to kill a person who's two realms of cultivation above him. Now, I'll pass it down to you!"
When she spoke up to this point, she seemed to have thought of something, and she roared with laughter, "All those years ago, he passed down Sword Intent to me and allowed me to step into the Sword Dao. Today, I'll pass down my sword technique to you …. Interesting!
Hahaha! "
As she spoke, she tapped with her finger, and a ray of light shot into the center of Ye Xuan's forehead.
Ye Xuan's figure trembled, and it didn't take long for countless pieces of information to surge into his mind.
Situ Tingyun gazed at Ye Xuan and smiled, "Little Junior Brother, we'll meet again in the future. I hope we'll be able to discuss the Dao with the sword when we do!"
As soon as she finished speaking, she transformed into a ray of light that vanished into the horizon.
She's gone!
The experts from the Whirling World instantly heaved sighs of relief when they saw Situ Tingyun leave as well.
Meanwhile, two women suddenly arrived in front of Ye Xuan, and it was Yue Xi and Yue Zun.
Yue Xi grinned, "Young Master Ye!"
Ye Xuan gazed at Yue Xi, "You're the Sect Master of the Whirling Sect?"
Yue Xi smiled, "I am!"
As she spoke, she opened her palm, and a scripture appeared there. She passed it to Ye Xuan, "Young Master Ye, this is the last scripture. Fate brought us together today, so I'll give it to Young Master Ye!"
Fate!
Li Shanshui and the others had extremely strange expressions on their faces!
Dammit!
She really knows how to talk!
Needless to say, the Whirling Sect had really become the biggest winner!
Because the Whirling Sect hadn't suffered any losses this time.
Actually, they'd come to an understanding now. The reason the Whirling Sect hadn't joined forces with them was definitely because they knew how formidable the person standing behind Ye Xuan was, so they refused to cooperate with them!
But this woman just refused to tell them!
She'd caused them to be practically annihilated!
She was too treacherous!
Ye Xuan glanced at Yue Xi. He didn't refuse, and he took the scripture and said, "Sect Master Yue, I've gathered all nine scriptures, and I'm willing to share them with the Whirling Sect!"
Yue Xi blinked, "Really?"
Ye Xuan nodded, "Of course!"
Yue Xi grinned, "Thank you, Young Master Ye!"
Actually, she was really happy. Because even if Ye Xuan didn't share them with the Whirling Sect, she wouldn't dare say anything!
She didn't know if Ye Xuan was really the master of the Ninth Dimension, but she knew that he was absolutely not an ordinary person!
After Ye Xuan put the scripture away, he glanced at everyone here, "Everyone, return to your respective residences!"
As soon as he finished speaking, he turned around and left.
Meanwhile, Li Shanshui hurriedly said, "Young Master Ye, we're all following you now. You …."
Ye Xuan thought for a moment, and then he said, "I'll look for all of you if I need anything!"
Li Shanshui hesitated for a moment, and then he said, "Young Master Ye, I'll follow by your side!"
All the experts of the Blackhat Sect had been killed!
So it was utterly meaningless for him to stay in the Whirling World.
Ye Xuan was about to speak when Li Shanshui added, "Young Master Ye, my Blackhat Sect has been around for over 100,000 years, and we still have some finances. If Young Master Ye doesn't mind, then I'll give them to Young Master Ye!"
Ye Xuan glanced at Li Shanshui, and the latter hurriedly said, "I don't have any ill intentions. I just want to follow Young Master Ye."
Now, Ye Xuan was his only way out!
Ye Xuan thought for a moment, and then he nodded. "Alright!"
Li Shanshui hurriedly said, "Young Master Ye, please wait a moment. I'll go back and pack up!"
As soon as he finished speaking, he turned around and left.
Ye Xuan glanced at the experts of the Dao Returning Institute and the Xiao Clan in the distance. They didn't make a stand.
He didn't force them!
Obviously, they wanted to stay in the Whirling World, and they didn't really want to follow Ye Xuan. After all, no one liked to be the subordinate of another. Moreover, the white robed woman and the Swordsman had left!
Right at this moment, the ancestor of the Profound Secrets Sect suddenly looked at Gu Wuchao and said angrily, "What are you still looking at?
Hurry up and pay your respects to Young Master Ye!
Are you trying to make me crawl out of my coffin from anger? "
Gu Wuchao was speechless.
..







Chapter 1438
When he heard the white haired old man, Gu Wuchao hurriedly walked over to Ye Xuan and bowed respectfully to Ye Xuan, "From today onward, my Profound Secrets Sect swears to follow Young Master Ye to the death!"
Ye Xuan gazed at the white haired old man. The white haired old man grinned, "Young Brother, it's their honor to follow you."
He hesitated for a moment as he spoke, and then he said, "I hope you'll treat them well as well!"
Actually, even though everyone here was aware that the white robed woman and the Swordsman were terrifying, they didn't know exactly how terrifying they were.
However, the white haired old man knew!
Because he was an expert above the Oneness Realm!
However, not to mention that he was only a strand of his soul, even his main body wouldn't be a match for a single attack from that woman.
In other words, the strength of those two women had exceeded the scope of his understanding.
If the Profound Secrets Sect followed Ye Xuan, then it would definitely be able to attain glory once more.
In the Profound Secrets Sect's opinion, it wasn't submission, it was an opportunity!
An enormous opportunity!
On many occasions, the accomplishments a person could attain in the future depended on who that person followed.
The Profound Secrets Sect had arrived at a certain height, and it was very difficult for it to improve further.
Unless an extraordinarily monstrous genius appeared within the sect. However, that was even more difficult!
Because it had been many years since an expert above the Oneness Realm had appeared in the Whirling World!
Now, an opportunity had been placed before the Profound Secrets Sect, and it was to follow Ye Xuan and rely on Ye Xuan to bring the Profound Secrets Sect to a new height!
Ye Xuan hesitated for a moment when he heard the white haired old man, and then he nodded, "Alright!"
He didn't refuse them!
The reason Qing 'er hadn't killed them was because she wanted to leave and leave some help for him!
But now, he really did need help!
He wanted to reorganize the Fifth Dimension and the Daoting!
He wanted to truly rebuild order!
And he needed people to accomplish all of that!
After they heard the Profound Secrets Sect's Ancestor speak, the other powers expressed their submission as well.
They suddenly understood something, and it was that Ye Xuan was a backer!
This thigh was right here, so why not cling to it?
Now that the Profound Secrets Sect had Ye Xuan as their backer, if they didn't submit, what would they do if the Profound Secrets Sect came looking for trouble with them in the future?
Most importantly, there was still the Whirling Sect in the Whirling World. This time, the Whirling Sect didn't suffer any losses!
It could be said that the Whirling Sect was currently the strongest sect. If they didn't cozy up to Ye Xuan, it was very likely that they would be devoured by the Whirling Sect!
So, after weighing the pros and cons, basically all the powers present expressed their willingness to submit to Ye Xuan.
And Ye Xuan did not refuse.
Meanwhile, Li Shanshui appeared here, and he walked over to Ye Xuan and smiled, "Young Master Ye, let's go!"
Ye Xuan nodded. "Alright!"
As he spoke, he glanced at the others. "All of you stay here and wait for my orders!"
Everyone hurriedly nodded.
Ye Xuan turned around and left with Li Shanshui.
After the two of them left, the others glanced at each other, and their eyes were filled with bitterness.
This time, all of them were almost finished.
On the other side, the Whirling Sect's Master, Yue Xi, remained silent, and no one knew what he was thinking.
Exalt Yue smiled, "Senior Sister, are you slightly disappointed?"
Yue Xi smiled, "What are you disappointed about?"
Exalt Yue gazed at the experts in the distance, "Senior Sister, you're disappointed that those two didn't kill all of them!
If those two seniors killed all of them, then the Whirling World would belong to my Whirling Sect!
But now, all of them have sided with Ye Xuan, so we can't attack or curse them. We seem to be quite passive instead, right? "
Exalt Yue smiled, "Indeed!"
Yue Xi spoke softly, "Senior Sister.
Regardless of whether we admit it or not, that Young Master Ye isn't someone we can afford to offend now!
Even if he wants our Whirling Sect to submit, we have no other choice! "
Yue Xi fell silent.
Exalt Yue continued, "Fortunately, that Young Master Ye doesn't seem to be very interested in the Whirling World!"
Yue Xi suddenly raised his head and looked towards the horizon, and he spoke softly, "I'm curious now. I'm curious about exactly what level of cultivation those two women have attained, and where they've gone …."
A short while later, everyone here left.
Once all of them left, a slovenly old man appeared here.
This slovenly old man was called over by the white cloud Swordsman, and everything had come to an end when he arrived here!
The slovenly old man fell silent for a long time before he spoke softly, "That Young Master Ye isn't simple at all …."
Meanwhile, a figure suddenly appeared by the slovenly old man's side.
It was the Ancestor of the Dark Abyss, Dao Brother's 2nd Brother!
Dao Brother's 2nd Brother gazed towards the direction Ye Xuan had left towards, "Senior Brother, long time no see!"
The slovenly old man's face remained emotionless, "Your Dark Abyss is gone!"
Dao Brother's 2nd Brother smiled, "If it's gone, then it's gone!
What's the big deal? "
The slovenly old man gazed at Dao Brother's 2nd Brother, "You won't give up, right?"
Dao Brother's 2nd Brother roared with laughter, "Do you think I should give up?"
The slovenly old man shook his head, "Junior Brother, why?
You, An Yuan, were in the wrong in this matter! "
Dao Brother's 2nd Brother roared with laughter, "I don't care if I'm in the wrong or not. All I know is that kindness must be repaid, and enmity must be repaid!"
The slovenly old man spoke softly, "If you choose to take revenge, then you'll be doomed eternally!"
Dao Brother's 2nd Brother gazed at the slovenly old man, "Senior Brother, do you know his true identity?"
The slovenly old man shook his head, "I don't!"
Dao Brother's 2nd Brother gazed at the slovenly old man and smiled, "Senior Brother, you didn't come back for this person, right?"
The slovenly old man glanced at Dao Brother's 2nd Brother, "Junior Brother, out of respect for Master, I'll say one more thing. Give up on taking revenge. If you insist on taking revenge, then you'll really be doomed eternally."
He turned around and left once he finished speaking.
Dao Brother's 2nd Brother smiled, "Senior Brother, aren't you underestimating me?"
The slovenly old man sighed, "We're used to being invincible in Master's era!
However, we don't know that there's always someone better out there! "
Dao Brother's 2nd Brother chuckled, "How interesting. Two women scared you, Senior Brother!
Senior Brother, you're becoming less and less courageous as you live! "
The slovenly old man turned around and glanced at Dao Brother's 2nd Brother, "Master once said, 'Don't argue with a retard, because it will lower your IQ'. I think Master's words are very reasonable!"
Dao Brother's 2nd Brother looked at the slovenly old man, "Senior Brother, don't forget that the Dao Scripture belongs to our Dao Sect. Now, it's in the hands of outsiders. Why, don't you have any thoughts about it?"
The slovenly old man was silent.
Dao Brother's 2nd Brother smiled, "You don't have any thoughts, but I do. I believe that Third Junior Sister and Junior Brother will not allow the Dao Scripture to fall into the hands of outsiders!"
He turned around and left after he finished speaking.
The slovenly old man sighed softly …
...
Ye Xuan brought Li Shanshui back to the Fifth Dimension.
Inside the main hall.
Guan Yin and the others were there, as were the experts of the Daoting!
It was worth mentioning that Bai Dizi was also there!
And now, the affairs of the entire Fifth Dimension were not only handled by Guan Yin alone, but also by Bai Dizi!
Bai Dizi's management skills were really terrifying, not something that Guan Yin could compare to!
It should be known that Ye Xuan's side was not only in the Fifth Dimension, but also in the Sixth Dimension, the Dao World, the Daoting, the Underworld … There were so many places and so many forces. It could be said that Guan Yin's ability was already somewhat insufficient!
But after Bai Dizi's arrival, she suddenly felt a lot more relaxed!
As for fighting for power, whether it was her or Bai Dizi, they did not have that level of power. Ordinary power was simply meaningless to them.
Now, Guan Yin was slowly delegating power because she also began to pay attention to personal cultivation!
Over the years, because she had to deal with complicated matters, her cultivation had fallen behind.
Ye Xuan looked at everyone. "Now, our crisis has been temporarily resolved, but we still have a lot of things to do!"
At this time, Bai Dizi walked out. He bowed slightly to Ye Xuan and said, "I have something to report!"
Ye Xuan looked at Bai Dizi. "Speak!"
Bai Dizi nodded. "We have three things to do now. The first is to formulate a set of laws that everyone will abide by. This set of laws will be the standard by which we will manage this world in the future. Those who violate the laws, no matter who they are, will be severely punished. I have already drafted this set of laws, and I will show it to you later!"
Ye Xuan shook his head. "Not only for me to see, but also for everyone in the hall!
Moreover, it has to be shown to the world! "
Bai Dizi looked at Ye Xuan. Ye Xuan said, "This set of laws will be the foundation by which we will manage this world in the future. So, this set of laws can't be formulated by a single person or a few people. Everyone should participate in it."
When they heard this, everyone hurriedly nodded to express their agreement!
Bai Dizi glanced at Ye Xuan and nodded. "That's for the best!
As for the second matter, even though the external crisis has been resolved, there might be an internal crisis soon!
Alliance Leader Ye, all the powers are envious of the mineral veins that you obtained earlier. Besides that, there are also some places in our universe with abundant spirit energy that everyone is envious of. Now, the thoughts of many people have started to drift away. So, we have to be extremely careful in how we distribute the benefits. "
Ye Xuan glanced at Bai Dizi. This Bai Dizi has really thought things through. Actually, many powers have started to fall into chaos from within before collapsing.
The current Fifth Dimension must also pay attention to this point!
Bai Dizi continued, "As for the third matter, that is development!
Vigorously develop!
For now, we have resolved the crisis. However, because of Alliance Leader Ye, this crisis might not exist for the time being!
In the future, there might be an even bigger crisis! "
Ye Xuan's face was filled with black lines.
The White Emperor's son continued, "In short, we need to be strong enough to protect ourselves!
In addition, we must train as many outstanding people as possible. "
After a moment of silence, Ye Xuan said, "Everyone retreat. Bai Dizi, you stay behind!"
Everyone looked at each other and retreated.
Inside the hall, only Ye Xuan and Bai Dizi were left.
Ye Xuan looked at Bai Dizi. "Do you think that now is the right time to rebuild order?"
Bai Dizi shook his head. "Not suitable?"
Ye Xuan was somewhat puzzled. "Why?"
Bai Dizi softly said, "Because we have more problems to deal with. For example, the internal balance of power, how to divide the benefits … If these problems are not dealt with properly, it will be a hidden bomb. If you are not here one day, this bomb will explode and the entire Fifth Dimension will instantly collapse."
As he said this, he looked at Ye Xuan. "Right now, we can only take one step at a time!
You must not be too hasty.
Moreover, I feel that the problem you should be thinking about right now is not the Fifth Dimension and order, but the problem of your strength and the reason for your disaster!
Moreover, the Dark Abyss has been destroyed, but is the ancestor Dark Abyss still alive? Will he take revenge?
Moreover, you now have the complete version of the Dao Scripture. This temptation is too great. Will some hidden forces come to snatch it?
They might not dare to openly, but what about in the dark?
Moreover, those two seniors have already left. If you are in danger, can you immediately let them come to the Fifth Dimension?
The most important thing is that they are very strong, but this does not mean that you are strong. Do you understand? "
Ye Xuan was silent.

Chapter 1439
In the hall, Bai Dizi glanced at Ye Xuan with a complicated expression. "Alliance Leader Ye, don't think that our crisis has been resolved. In fact, according to my understanding and investigation of you, this matter is definitely not over!"
Ye Xuan said softly, "The cause of calamity?"
Bai Dizi nodded.
Ye Xuan was silent.
Bai Dizi continued, "For now, your top priority is to improve your strength. It would be best if you could attain Dao or even Unification."
Ye Xuan nodded. "I understand!"
Bai Dizi continued, "Do you still have the Dao Cause and God's Seal that the ancestor gave you?"
Ye Xuan nodded. "Of course!"
Bai Dizi said in a deep voice, "I will make arrangements. Now, you are the spiritual belief of our entire Five-Dimensional Universe. This belief must be materialized. I will get people to build statues of you all over the world so that people will believe in you. Then, you will be able to obtain the Power of Faith continuously!"
Ye Xuan frowned. "Brainwashing?"
Bai Dizi shook his head. "It's not brainwashing. The entire universe treats you as their spiritual belief. You are the one who gave the Five-Dimensional Universe everything!
They are willing to believe in you. However, I want to materialize this Power of Faith for you to use. "
Ye Xuan thought about it and nodded. "Alright!"
Bai Dizi continued, "There is one more thing. I have already recalled many of the former Dao Guardians. They also need the Power of Faith. Of course, if they want the Power of Faith, they will have to fight for it themselves. Of course, I will take care of it and not let them act recklessly for the sake of fighting for the Power of Faith.
In addition, I will reintegrate the Five-Dimensional Universe, the Dao World, the Six-Dimensional Universe, and the Daoting. I will try my best to integrate everyone into one. There will be no division between the Five-Dimensional and the Six-Dimensional Universe. "
Ye Xuan nodded. "This is very necessary!"
Bai Dizi nodded. "What I'm most afraid of is them forming small groups. If that happens, it will be very troublesome to manage them."
Ye Xuan looked at Bai Dizi. "I'll leave these matters to you!"
Bai Dizi nodded. "I will take care of the matters of the Five-Dimensional Universe. As for you, you must increase your strength as soon as possible. Also, if possible, help Miss Nian Nian recover her memories. If she does, our universe will be safer!"
Ye Xuan shook his head. "I can't do anything about that!"
Bai Dizi said in a low voice, "Did Miss Nian deliberately lose her memory?"
Ye Xuan nodded. "It's highly possible!"
Bai Dizi frowned. "Why would she deliberately choose to lose her memory?
Is it because of the Disaster Seed on you? "
Ye Xuan whispered, "Maybe it's because of this!"
Why didn't the white-robed Qing'er stay?
Because of the Cause of Calamity!
The Cause of Calamity had already affected her, so she chose to leave immediately!
In other words, the stronger the person by her side, especially the kind of person who could change the trajectory of her fate, the more likely she would be targeted by the Cause of Calamity!
And now, Nian Nian was not targeted by the Cause of Calamity!
Because she did not have the strength!
Was that the reason?
Ye Xuan did not know!
But he knew that Nian Nian definitely had her reasons for doing this!
Bai Dizi sighed softly. Her expression was complicated. "Then let's not talk about Miss Nian Nian!
Let's talk about you!
You should have gathered all nine Dao Scriptures by now, right? "
Ye Xuan nodded. "Yes!"
Bai Dizi looked at Ye Xuan. "Many people are paying attention to you!"
Ye Xuan smiled. "You want me to share them?"
Bai Dizi nodded.
Ye Xuan smiled. "Then do you think I should share them?"
Bai Dizi looked at Ye Xuan. "It depends on whether you want to or not!
If you don't want to, no one can force you! "
Ye Xuan said softly. "I promised them that I would share them!"
Bai Dizi said in a deep voice. "Even if you want to share them, you can't just casually share them. Some people's cultivation is not enough to comprehend this Dao Scripture. Do you understand what I mean?"
Ye Xuan nodded.
Bai Dizi said. "You deal with these things yourself!"
With that, he left.
Inside the hall. Ye Xuan sat cross-legged on the ground. He opened his palm. The nine Dao Scriptures appeared in front of him.
At this moment, Ye Zhiming appeared beside him.
Ye Xuan looked at Ye Zhiming. "I never thought that I would really gather all nine Dao Scriptures!
I just don't know if it's a blessing or a curse! "
Ye Zhiming said. "If it's a blessing, it's not a curse. If it's a curse, it can't be avoided!"
Ye Xuan smiled. "That's true!"
With that, he looked at the last three Dao Scriptures!
Two of the scrolls were obtained from An Yuan. These two scrolls were: Dao and Law.
Ye Xuan frowned. "Dao?
Law? "
Ye Zhiming opened the Dao Scripture. After looking at it for a moment, she looked at Ye Xuan. "This Dao Scripture can allow one to reach Dao Imperial and Dao Attainment. It describes these two realms, which is suitable for you now.
As for Law … "
Ye Xuan asked. "Return to one?"
Ye Zhiming nodded. "Yes!"
Ye Xuan said in a deep voice. "The Dao Ancestor and the rest have not reached Return to one!"
Ye Zhiming looked at Ye Xuan. "What about Zhao Zhiqing's generation?"
Hearing this, Ye Xuan understood.
Although the Dao Ancestor has not reached Return to one, Zhao Zhiqing has definitely reached Return to one.
Obviously, it's not because of the Dao Scripture, but because of the Dao Ancestor's generation!
Ye Zhiming said in a deep voice. "This Dao Scripture is too profound. I can't understand it!"
Ye Xuan was a little surprised. "Even you can't understand it?"
Ye Zhiming nodded. "My realm is not high enough to understand it!
For example, this sentence: Humans follow Earth, Earth follows Heaven, Heaven follows Dao, Dao follows nature … It's easy to understand from the words, but what is the true meaning of this sentence? "
Ye Xuan was silent.
Ye Zhiming said in a deep voice. "This Dao Scripture has tens of thousands of words, and there are hundreds of Dao Scriptures.
In this world, there is not only Dao, but also Law … "
Saying this, she looked at Ye Xuan. "This senior who created the Dao Scripture is really an amazing person."
Ye Xuan nodded.
In this world, there are two kinds of experts, those within the Dao Scripture and those outside.
It could be said that the senior who created this scripture was absolutely terrifying. This was because he had created a complete cultivation system, and this cultivation system was the origin of all martial arts that were currently known to exist.
Ye Zhiming said in a deep voice, "We can study this Dao Scripture. If we can understand the Dao Scripture, it will definitely benefit you greatly in terms of cultivation.
As for the Dao Scripture, Martial Arts, and Heart Sutras, I can't understand them at the moment. "
Ye Xuan nodded. "Take your time!"
As if thinking of something, he looked at the last Dao Scripture. There were no words on it.
Wordless Dao Scripture?
Ye Zhiming opened the Dao Scripture, and when she opened it, she was instantly stunned.
Because there was nothing inside!
It was empty. Wordless Dao Scripture!
Ye Xuan and Ye Zhiming exchanged glances. Their eyes were filled with confusion.
Ye Xuan frowned slightly. "Could it be that the Whirling Sect gave us a fake one?"
Ye Zhiming shook her head. "I don't think so!"
Ye Xuan nodded. "I don't think it's possible either!"
Ye Zhiming suddenly said, "It seems like Miss Xuan Chu hasn't returned to the Whirling Sect yet. Why don't we invite her over?"
Ye Xuan put the Dao Scripture away and disappeared from the hall with Ye Zhiming.
A while later, Ye Xuan found Xuan Chu, who was eating noodles in a small noodle shop in the city!
Xuan Chu was stunned when she saw Ye Xuan. She put down her chopsticks and looked at Ye Xuan. "What's up?"
Ye Xuan said with a smile, "Miss Xuan Chu, I have something to ask!"
Xuan Chu nodded. "Speak!"
Ye Xuan took out the last Dao Scripture and placed it in front of Xuan Chu.
Xuan Chu glanced at Ye Xuan. "Did the Sect Master give it to you?"
Ye Xuan nodded.
Xuan Chu fell silent.
Ye Xuan said with a smile, "I've collected all nine Dao Scriptures. I promised the Whirling Sect's Sect Master that I'm willing to share them with your sect!"
Xuan Chu nodded. She opened the Dao Scripture. When she saw the Dao Scripture, she was slightly stunned.
Ye Xuan frowned. "What's the matter?"
Xuan Chu said with a deep voice, "I've never seen a Dao Scripture before because Master taught me verbally."
Ye Xuan fell silent.
At this moment, a voice came from behind Ye Xuan, "Alliance Master Ye, do you need help?"
Ye Xuan turned around and saw a woman standing not far from him.
It was Venerable Yue!
Venerable Yue smiled. "Young master Ye, are you wondering why there are no words in this Dao Scripture?"
Ye Xuan nodded. "Yes."
Venerable Yue smiled. "Young master Ye, there are no words in this Dao Scripture!"
Ye Xuan frowned. "Why?"
Venerable Yue looked at the Dao Scripture and said softly, "Young master Ye, what is the Great Dao?
The true Great Dao? "
Ye Xuan fell silent.
Venerable Yue looked at Ye Xuan. "Dao is not only the Dao of the universe, but also the Dao of nature!
The 'Dao' is in the matter, and the matter is in the 'Dao'. All things lead to the same destination, and they all lead to the 'Dao'.
Everyone is pursuing Dao, but they don't know that Dao is right beside them. Dao is you, and you are Dao! "
Ye Xuan fell silent.
Venerable Yue smiled. "You don't understand, do you?"
Ye Xuan nodded.
Venerable Yue smiled. "On the surface, it's easy to understand.
But it's not so easy to understand the concept!
Just like what people say, a mountain is not a mountain, a mountain is still a mountain, and a mountain is not a mountain … This is a concept of life. Those who haven't experienced it won't understand it no matter what you tell them. "
As she spoke, she looked at Ye Xuan and added, "Tao" was not just a tangible "substance," a thoughtful "spirit," or a rational "law." Instead, it was the invisible, ethereal, and spiritual root of the universe that created all of this.
"Matter", "spirit", and "law" were all derivatives of "Dao".
'Dao' is the Innate Qi, the Primordial Chaos. 'Dao' is the ancestor of nature, the origin of all things in the universe … Mister Ye, this last Dao scripture is broad and profound. Even my Whirling Sect has only comprehended a little bit of it, and this little bit is like a drop in the ocean for this Dao scripture. "
When she spoke up to here, she looked at the Daoist scripture with a complicated expression. "The ancestor of my Whirling Sect once said that the knowledge of this Daoist scripture is boundless. Even if he spent his entire life studying it, he wasn't able to study it completely. Not to mention studying it completely, he didn't even study a tenth of it!"
After a moment of silence, Ye Xuan asked, "Senior, where did the owner of this Dao Scripture go?"
Venerable Yue looked at Ye Xuan. "It's said that he died!"
Ye Xuan was stunned. "Died?"
Venerable Yue nodded.
Ye Xuan frowned. "How is that possible?"
Venerable Yue shook her head. "Nothing is impossible!"
Ye Xuan said in a deep voice, "Did he die naturally or was he killed?"
Venerable Yue said softly, "I don't know!
However, it shouldn't be a natural death. This kind of expert can study Dao so thoroughly, so how could he die naturally?
But if he was killed … "
Saying that, she didn't continue.
.....







Chapter 1440
Killed?
Ye Xuan fell silent.
If the owner of this Dao Scripture was killed, then what does that mean?
Ye Xuan didn't dare to think about it.
At this moment, Venerable Yue suddenly smiled, "Don't think about that!
Young Master Ye, you already have nine Dao Scriptures, and all of them contain Dao Scriptures, martial arts, and mental cultivation techniques. Moreover, I can see that you've already learned the Dao Fist and Dao Body. Since that's the case, then you might as well learn the remaining three Dao Scriptures, martial arts, and mental cultivation techniques! "
Ye Xuan looked at Venerable Yue, "Senior, please guide me!"
Venerable Yue blinked, "Young Master Ye, if I guide you, then you'll have to let me read the Dao Scriptures!"
Ye Xuan smiled, "I've already said that I want to share the Dao Scriptures with your Whirling Sect. Venerable Yue wouldn't think that I'm joking, right?"
Venerable Yue laughed, "How could I?
Since that's the case, then I'll thank Young Master Ye on behalf of the Whirling Sect! "
Ye Xuan nodded, "Let's begin!"
Just as Bai Dizi said, his top priority now was to improve his strength.
This Dao Scripture was the best way for him to improve his strength.
As for the Dao Scriptures, his understanding wasn't as thorough as the Whirling Sect. If he had the Whirling Sect's help, then he would be able to comprehend these Dao Scriptures much faster!
At this moment, Venerable Yue smiled, "Young Master Ye, I didn't come alone this time. I've brought a few elders from my Whirling Sect. They've been studying the Dao Scriptures in my Whirling Sect all year round, and their understanding of the Dao Scriptures far surpasses ordinary people. With their help, Young Master Ye will be able to comprehend these Dao Scriptures better!"
As soon as she finished speaking, four old men suddenly appeared behind her.
The four of them bowed slightly to Ye Xuan, "Greetings, Young Master Ye!"
Ye Xuan smiled, "Then let's begin!"
Venerable Yue smiled, "Let's go somewhere else?"
Ye Xuan nodded.
In next to no time, everyone arrived at the Sword Hall that Ye Xuan resided in. Ye Xuan called Aro, An Lanxiu, A 'Jiu, and the others to the hall!
At times like this, they naturally had to be there!
This was because their study of the Dao Scriptures would be of great help to them!
Inside the hall, Ye Xuan took out all the Daoist scriptures!
The Nine Scrolls of Dao Scriptures!
Yue Zun had a complicated expression as he looked at the nine Dao Scriptures.
She did not expect Ye Xuan to have gathered all nine volumes of the Taoist Scripture!
Meanwhile, Ye Xuan suddenly said, "Let's start with the first volume!"
"The first volume?"
Yue Zun looked at Ye Xuan, "We're not going to start from the last three volumes?"
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "I'll take the first volume!"
Yue Zun glanced at the women, and she understood!
Yue Zun looked at the four elders behind him, "We will start from the first scroll!
Be more specific! "
The four elders nodded.
Soon, the four elders began to explain the first volume of the Dao Scriptures, while Ye Xuan asked Guan Yin to record it down.
Ye Xuan was also listening attentively!
This was because the four elders were very detailed, and there were many points of knowledge that he and Guan Yin did not discover.
It was worth mentioning that Nian Nian was also at the side.
She was also listening.
No one noticed that when the four elders were explaining the Dao Scriptures, she would shake her head from time to time … as if saying that this was not right …
...
Ancient God Abyss.
At the moment when the Dark Abyss was destroyed, the happiest was naturally the Ancient God Abyss.
They had fought with the Dark Abyss for many years, and now, the Dark Abyss was finally destroyed!
In their Star Sector, the Ancient God Abyss could be said to be the strongest.
At the top of a pyramid, Su Zhe stood quietly. In front of him was a white-haired elder. This person was his Master, and also the current leader of the Ancient God Abyss!
The white-haired elder said softly, "I heard that Young Master Ye has gathered all nine Dao Scriptures?"
Su Zhe glanced at the white-haired elder and nodded.
The white-haired elder chuckled. "In the current Fifth Dimension, there must be many places that need manpower. How about this!
Let us personally go to the Fifth Dimension and see if Young Master Ye needs any help! "
Su Zhe had a strange expression.
Was he going to help?
He wanted to read the Dao Scriptures!
Of course, there was nothing wrong with that.
For the Dao Scriptures, especially those like his Master, the temptation was huge.
Soon, the two left the Ancient God Abyss and headed to the Fifth Dimension.
...
In the Dao Tomb.
Inside the hall, the Lord looked at Luo Hou and the others and smiled. "Don't you have anything to say?"
Luo Hou hesitated, then said, "I've been quite free recently. Why don't we find a place to walk and relax?"
Ah Ku nodded. "Indeed!
Why don't we choose the Fifth Dimension!
The scenery there is quite good! "
The Lord laughed. "Then what are we waiting for?
Let's go! "
With that, they got up and left for the Fifth Dimension.
...
Nine Dao Scriptures!
By now, who did not know that Ye Xuan had gathered all nine Dao Scriptures?
Everyone was envious of him!
However, basically no one dared to have any evil thoughts. One had to know that even someone as strong as An Yuan had disappeared without a trace overnight!
However, there were always exceptions.
...
In the starry sky of the Fifth Dimension, an old man stood quietly. Beside him, there was a young man.
The old man looked down and said softly, "I never thought that someone would actually gather all the Dao Scriptures … Interesting!"
The young man looked down at the Fifth Dimension. "Snatch it?"
The old man glanced at the young man. "Snatch it?
What are you going to use to snatch it?
There are at least a dozen Consolidation Realm experts down there!
Do you think the two of us can fight them? "
The young man coldly looked down at the Fifth Dimension. "Just a dozen!"
The old man shook his head. "A dozen Consolidation Realm experts is naturally not scary. The scary thing is this Young Master Ye!
What kind of existence is An Yuan?
It was once a force created by Second Brother Dao. However, it disappeared without a trace in one night … And the Whirling World, the major forces of the Whirling World have all submitted to this Young Master Ye … You can imagine how terrifying the two women who went to the Whirling World are! "
The young man said softly, "But Grandfather will not give up, right?"
The old man smiled. "Of course!
Who doesn't want to see the complete version of the Dao Scriptures?
However, we can change the method, such as cooperation!
In any case, this Young Master Ye is also sharing the Dao Scriptures. In that case, sharing one more should not be a problem for him. However, we will have to pay a price. "
The young man was silent.
The old man said again, "As a person, you must be able to judge the situation.
My Nanyue clan has been able to survive for so many years because of one word: caution.
Many families and forces perished because they were too arrogant, too arrogant! "
As he spoke, he looked down at the Fifth Dimension and said softly, "Although our Nanyue clan has a deep foundation, we cannot afford to be reckless!"
The young man looked down, "I heard that Ye Xuan is the number one among the younger generation. I want to meet him!"
The old man smiled. "We can exchange pointers, but there is no need to become enemies. Do you understand?"
The young man nodded. "Of course!"
The old man smiled. "Then let us pay a visit to this Young Master Ye!"
The two disappeared from the scene.
....
Below, in a certain hall, Bai Dizi looked at the old man and young man in front of him, "You two are from the Nanyue clan?"
The old man smiled. "Yes!"
Bai Dizi cupped his fists. "Forgive me for being ignorant, but I have never heard of this Nanyue clan!"
The old man smiled. "Nanyue clan is quite far from here. It is normal that you have never heard of it."
Bai Dizi smiled. "How far?"
The old man looked at Bai Dizi. "You know about Whirling World and Ancient God Abyss. Do you know about Xuan City?"
Bai Dizi frowned. "Xuan City?"
The old man nodded.
Bai Dizi shook his head. "I don't know!"
The old man smiled. "We are not from Xuan City. However, we are quite far from it."
Bai Dizi looked at the old man. "You are here for the Dao scripture?"
The old man nodded. "Yes!
My Nanyue clan also wants to look at the Dao scripture. Of course, we will not look for it for free. We can cooperate with Young Master Ye. "
Bai Dizi smiled. "You are welcome!
However, Alliance Leader Ye is busy now. I wonder if you can wait for a moment? "
The young man frowned. He was a little displeased.
The old man smiled. "Of course!"
Bai Dizi smiled. "It is not that I am neglecting you two. Young Master Ye has instructed that no one is to disturb him … So, I hope you two can understand!"
The old man smiled. "It doesn't matter. Go do what you need to do!"
Bai Dizi cupped his fists and retreated.
Inside the hall, the young man said coldly, "What arrogance!"
The old man smiled. "We are the ones begging him now!"
As he said that, he glanced at the young man. "Qing'er, you must correct your attitude!
Because from the looks of it, my Nanyue clan does not have any advantage when facing this Young Master Ye.
We have a deep foundation, but the power behind this Young Master Ye is even more unfathomable. "
The young man was silent.
The old man continued. "This time, we are here to seek cooperation, not to seek enmity.
Even if we can't cooperate, we must try our best not to be enemies with this Young Master Ye! "
As he said that, he looked at the young man. "Qing'er, if you want to become the clan's heir and inherit the clan, you must learn how to conduct yourself well!
Otherwise, no matter how talented you are or how strong you are, the clan will not let you be in power.
The person in power does not need to be too strong, but you must have a good head. Otherwise, if you are not careful, it will bring disaster to the clan. "
The young man was silent.
The old man continued. "Just cultivating is not enough.
To become the clan's heir, strength is part of it, but emotional intelligence and conduct are what we old fellows value more. "
The young man said softly, "I understand!"
The old man nodded. "This time, I brought you out as a test. As for what the test is, I won't tell you. Think about it yourself. If you pass the test, you still have hope of becoming the heir. If you fail, when we return, the clan will arrange for you to go to the trial grounds to cultivate. We will train you to be the clan's guardian and not the heir. Do you understand what I mean?"
The young man slowly clenched his right hand and lowered his head in silence.
The old man glanced at the young man. "Compared to the other heirs, your only advantage is that you are stronger than them, but …"
At this moment, a voice came from outside the door. "I wonder if Young Master Ye is here?"
The voice was very familiar!
The young man frowned.
The old man said in a deep voice, "He is here too!"
As he said that, he stood up and left.
Outside the hall, Bai Dizi was receiving a young man in a luxurious robe.
Nanyue Xiu!
He was also one of the young masters of the Nanyue clan!
Nanyue Xiu bowed slightly to Bai Dizi. "Senior, I am the seventh young master of the Nanyue clan. I am here to see Young Master Ye!"
Bai Dizi glanced at Nanyue Xiu. "I'm sorry, Young Master Ye is in seclusion!"
Nanyue Xiu smiled. "Alright, I will wait for him."
As he said that, he took out a storage ring and put it in Bai Dizi's hand. "Senior, this is a Dao Pill. If you are trying to reach the Dao Realm, with the help of this pill, your chances will increase by at least 50%!
Of course, with senior's talent and strength, reaching the Dao Realm is nothing to you … However, this is junior's gift. I hope senior will accept it. "
Hearing this, Bai Dizi's expression changed …
....
PS: In the book review section, there is a reader who keeps scolding me. His scolding is very unpleasant. He comes every day to greet me and my family.
To be honest, I really don't understand why he hates me so much. The insults between the lines are as if I am the murderer of his father.
Moreover, when he scolds you, you can't scold him or even ban him. If you ban him, he will go to the book group to scold you or change his account to scold you …
Just like before, a reader wrote an outline for me and asked me to write it according to his outline … I ignored him. Two days later, he messaged me and scolded me on QQ crazily. He said all kinds of nasty things like how my family deserved it and so on …
Sometimes, I couldn't help but reply, "Get lost," and he would say, "Heh, is this how an author is?
Is this all you have? "
I was speechless.
....
I, Luan, know my own limitations. This is my second book. I'm not a newbie, but I'm not an old man either. I have a lot of shortcomings, but I've been working hard, hoping to write better!
After all, this is my job.
If it's not good, you can criticize and deserve to be criticized. You can even scold me, but just scold me, there's no need to involve my family.
Actually, some readers don't know that some of their good suggestions in the book review section have been integrated into the book because I have to admit that some of the readers' ideas are really awesome.
In the end, many people are debating which of the three swords is the strongest … In your heart, who do you think is the strongest?
Also, Ye Xuan's true identity will slowly be revealed.







Chapter 1441
Dao Core!
He would be lying if he said he wasn't tempted!
After all, he, Bai Dizi, was now at Dao Controlling Realm. Achieving Dao Realm was his goal.
However, he didn't accept it!
Bai Dizi smiled. "Young Master, this gift is too expensive. This old man can't accept it!
As for meeting Alliance Leader Ye, you can wait with your clansmen for a while because Young Master Ye is about to come out! "
He cupped his fists and left.
Nan Yue Xiu's eyes flashed with surprise.
He didn't expect this old man to be able to refuse this temptation!
Bai Dizi naturally refused this temptation. Take people's hands and break them!
It could be said that in the Fifth Dimension, other than Ye Xuan, he had the greatest authority.
If he was corrupt, the impact wouldn't be bad.
Most importantly, if his subordinates followed his example, then wouldn't his original intention of establishing order be destroyed?
Why did he, Bai Dizi, submit to Ye Xuan?
Was it because of his future?
No!
He wanted to rebuild order!
Nan Yue Xiu put away the pill and looked at the old man and young man not far away. "So it's Elder Qi and Brother Qing!"
Nan Yue Xiu smiled. "Seventh Young Master is also here!"
Nan Yue Xiu nodded. "Gathering Dao Scriptures is such a big event. I naturally came to join in the fun!"
Nan Yue Qi said softly, "It seems that Xuan City and the other clans should also know!"
Nan Yue Xiu smiled. "That's for sure!
However, as far as I know, Xuan City's City Lord is currently doing his best to investigate this Young Master Ye. I wonder what their attitude is! "
Nan Yue Qi frowned. "Investigation?"
Nan Yue Xiu nodded. "I don't know what they are investigating this Young Master Ye, but it's definitely not simple!"
He looked at Nan Yue Qi and smiled. "Grand Elder, this is not a private matter, so I hope we can cooperate."
Nan Yue Qi said solemnly, "Of course!"
Internal strife was bound to happen in a big clan, but it definitely depended on the situation!
Infighting when there were external enemies was definitely a big taboo in the family.
The ancestor of Nanyue had once left behind his last words. The position of heir could be fought over, but they could not ally with outsiders to act against their own people. If someone did this, then anyone in the clan could summon the ancestor. He left behind a wisp of his soul to severely punish those who colluded with outsiders.
The reason why the Nanyue Clan was able to maintain its prosperity for so many years was largely related to the last words left behind by this ancestor!
Because no one dared to act recklessly!
Even if you become the clan leader, if you don't get the position right, once the ancestor's soul fragment appears, you'll still be doomed!
They could fight for it!
But it has to be healthy competition.
Nanyue Xiu looked around and smiled, "Elder Qi, when I came, I took a stroll around the cosmos. Did you notice something? This place isn't normal!"
Nan Yueqi asked, "What do you mean?"
Nanyue Xiu whispered: "If I'm not wrong, this Young Master Ye is very ambitious. He wants to rebuild the Daoting Order of the past"
Nan Yueqi was silent.
Nanyue Xiu continued: "Moreover, the people here believe in this Young Master Ye. In their hearts, Young Master Ye is God …"
At this point, he looked at Nan Yueqi, "If I'm not wrong, the power of faith is going to appear again."
Nan Yueqi whispered: "I'm afraid it won't be that easy!"
Nanyue Xiu smiled, "It really won't be that easy!
However, this Young Master Ye isn't that easy to bully. This time, let's see if those people dare to suppress him! "
Nan Yueqi said in a deep voice, "Wasn't the Daoting at its peak in the past?
Wasn't it suppressed to the point of extinction … If it wasn't for that Zhao Zhiqing, the Daoting would've been extinct.
But wasn't she exiled in the end? "
Nanyue Xiu shook his head, "It's different!
Very different! "
Nan Yueqi asked, "What's different?"
Nan Yueqi said with a smile, "I've investigated. Young Master Ye and the Daoting were rivals. However, when that Qing Zhu saw Ye Xuan, he immediately killed the Dao Ancestor's body and made Ye Xuan the Dao Lord. In other words, that Qing Zhu thinks highly of Young Master Ye!
And there must be something behind this. "
Nan Yueqi said in a deep voice, "The force behind Young Master Ye!"
Nan Yueqi nodded, "Three people have appeared before. The first one killed a Human Venerable from the Dark Abyss with a clone. We don't know how strong this person's force is.
We also don't know where this person came from.
The second person was the white-robed woman. She had destroyed An Yuan with a single punch, and her strength was definitely far beyond the Consolidation Realm. She might have even reached the legendary level, or even higher … Even Xuan City would have to be wary of such an expert!
There's also that Swordsman woman. She used to be the Sect Leader of the Sword Sect, Situ Tingyun. Although she doesn't fight much, she might not be weaker than that white-robed woman … "
She looked at Nan Yueqi, "These two are enough to intimidate Xuan City and that place."
Nan Yueqi said in a deep voice, "They can intimidate, but they might not be afraid."
Nan Yueqi smiled, "Yes!
Young Master Ye wants to rebuild order and restore faith energy. This is equivalent to touching someone's interests. Moreover, Young Master Ye has the complete version of the Dao Scripture. That place will definitely be tempted. They don't have a choice!
Once Young Master Ye rebuilds order, then does Daoting those who were exiled, like this Qing Zhu, mean that Ye Xuan will save them?
Once they come out … Do you think that place will let Ye Xuan save them? "
Nan Yueqi was silent.
Nan Yueqi said softly, "This place looks peaceful, but it's not. Danger lurks everywhere!
This time, it's also a challenge for our Nan Yueqi Clan. Following Young Master Ye, we can share the complete version of the Dao Scripture, but it might also bring trouble to ourselves. "
Nan Yueqi was silent.
Nan Yueqing suddenly said, "We can use something to exchange with Young Master Ye. After seeing the Dao Scripture, we will no longer have anything to do with him!"
Nan Yueqi shook his head.
Nan Yueqi looked at Nan Yueqing and smiled, "Ninth Brother, if this Young Master Ye is as simple as you, then it would be great!"
Nan Yueqing frowned, "What do you mean?"
Nan Yueqi smiled, "Ninth Brother, do you think our Nan Yueqi Clan has anything that can compare to this Dao Scripture?"
Nan Yueqing's lips moved, but he had nothing to say.
Because there isn't!
Nan Yueqi continued, "Do you think this Young Master Ye will let us enjoy his Dao Scripture for free?
Of course not!
Look at that old man, he's not simple. Do you think this Young Master Ye is a good person? "
Nan Yueqing was silent.
Nan Yueqi smiled, "If we want the Dao Scripture, we must pay a price, and it might be very big!"
Nan Yueqi said in a deep voice, "What does Patriarch think?"
Nan Yueqi shrugged, "Patriarch wants me to understand this Young Master Ye!"
Saying that, he looked at the sky, "Not only our Nan Yueqi Clan, Xuan City, Gu Clan, Chi Clan, and that place … they should have sent people to this universe.
I believe they are not only investigating Young Master Ye, but also the people behind him!
Where did these people come from? "
Nan Yueqi looked around, "My Nan Yueqi Clan has also investigated, but there is no news of these people, right?"
Nan Yueqi nodded, "Yes.
This is the scariest part!
These people behind him are so powerful, but not only there is no news of them in this universe, even our place has no news of them!
Then here comes the problem!
Where are these people now?
They can't be hiding and cultivating in secret, right? "
Nan Yueqi said softly, "Looks like I still underestimated this Young Master Ye!"
Nan Yueqi smiled, then looked at Nan Yueqing, "Little Brother Qing, I know you are very strong, but when you see this Young Master Ye, please be polite. Even if we can't cooperate with him, we must not become enemies with him."
Nan Yueqing was expressionless, "I don't need you to teach me this!"
Nan Yueqi laughed, "I'm just reminding you!"
At this moment, Bai Dizi appeared in front of the three. He looked at them, "The three of you, Alliance Master Ye invites you!"
Nan Yueqi cupped his fists, "Thank you!"
Under Bai Dizi's lead, the three of them came to a courtyard.
Ye Xuan didn't meet the three of them in the Sword Hall because Yue Zun and the others were still explaining the Dao Scripture!
Inside the courtyard, when he saw Ye Xuan, Nan Yueqi cupped his fists and said with a smile, "Young Master Ye!"
Ye Xuan also cupped his fists and said with a smile, "The three of you are from Nan Yueqi Clan?"
Nan Yueqi nodded, "That's right!"
Ye Xuan made an inviting gesture, "The three of you, please sit!"
Nan Yueqi and the other two sat around the stone table. Nan Yueqi looked at Ye Xuan and said with a smile, "Young Master Ye, I won't beat around the bush!
This time, I want to represent my Nan Yueqi Clan to cooperate with Young Master Ye! "
Ye Xuan said with a smile, "Dao Scripture?"
Nan Yueqi nodded.
Ye Xuan smiled slightly, "I wonder what Nan Yueqi Clan wants to use to exchange?"
Nan Yueqi was speechless and didn't know what to say.
What to use to exchange?
Nothing can be used to exchange for it!
At this time, Nan Yueqi suddenly said with a smile, "Young Master Ye, what Elder Qi said just now was just a joke!
Actually, the main reason we came here this time is to get to know Young Master Ye! "
Ye Xuan glanced at Nan Yueqi and said with a smile, "Is that so?"
Nan Yueqi laughed, "Of course!
We've long heard that Young Master Ye is a genius, the number one in the younger generation. This time, we came here to get to know Young Master Ye and see if we can be friends! "
Ye Xuan shook his head, "I don't deserve to be called the number one in the younger generation.
As for being friends, I, Ye Xuan, am willing to make friends! "
Nan Yueqi smiled, "Young Master Ye, I wonder how much do you know about the history of Daoting!"
Ye Xuan looked at Nan Yueqi, "It's limited to this generation!"
Nan Yueqi thought for a moment and said, "Dao Physique was once glorious!
Incomparably glorious!
Especially Lord Qing's generation!
At that time, Daoting's faith power made all the worlds fear it!
But later, Daoting suddenly declined … Lord Qing's generation went missing. Young Master Ye, do you know why? "
Ye Xuan shook his head, "I don't know!"
Nan Yueqi was about to speak when Ye Xuan suddenly smiled and said, "I don't want to know either!"
Nan Yueqi was stunned.
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "You three, I'm currently studying the nine scrolls of Dao Scripture with Whirling Sect's powerhouses, are you interested?"
Hearing this, Nan Yueqi was silent.
Nan Yueqi was also silent.
Nan Yueqing suddenly said, "We are interested, but will you let us see it?"
On the side, Nan Yueqi shook his head, this silly brother!
Nan Yueqi also shook his head.
Why should he let them see it?
.....







Chapter 1442
Ye Xuan looked at Nan Yueqing and said with a smile: "Then do you think I should show it to you?"
Nan Yueqing was about to speak but Ye Xuan got up and left.
He didn't know what kind of force this Nan Yueqing was, but he was sure that the other party wanted benefits but didn't want to put in too much effort.
Since that was the case, then there was no need to cooperate!
Although he, Ye Xuan, could share Dao Scriptures, it was only with those who helped him. These people in front of him had never helped him, so why should he share them?
He, Ye Xuan, was not a good person, nor was he a charity.
Moreover, he didn't share all Dao Scriptures.
For example, some Self Release Realm experts, he would only share the first and second volumes and not the last few volumes. Because doing so wouldn't bring any benefits to the other party and might even bring trouble to them!
As Bai Dizi said, Dao Scriptures could be shared but not recklessly.
After Ye Xuan left, inside the hall, Nan Yueqi looked at Nan Yuexiu. Nan Yuexiu said softly: "What he wants, the three of us can't decide!"
On the side, Nan Yueqing frowned, "What does he want?"
Hearing this, Nan Yueqi sighed softly.
At this time, he suddenly understood that Nan Yueqing was not suitable to be the clan's heir. Although he was the most talented among all the young masters, his strength was also the highest.
But his understanding of the world was the lowest among all the young masters.
This was also normal because Nan Yueqing spent most of his time cultivating in the clan and rarely dealt with outside matters. Therefore, in terms of understanding of the world, he was too lacking compared to the other young masters.
On the side, Nan Yuexiu said with a smile: "This Young Master Ye wants us to be together with him. In other words, he wants to tie our Nan Yueqing together with him!"
Nan Yueqing said solemnly: "Didn't you say that the force behind him is extremely powerful?
Then what's the problem with being tied to him? "
Nan Yuexiu said with a smile: "It's a big problem!
We all know that the force behind him is extremely powerful, but what about his enemies?
Currently, the known enemies are not people our Nan Yueqing clan can provoke!
But who knows if he has other enemies? "
Nanyue Qing was silent.
Nanyue Xiu continued: "Being bound to Young Master Ye has great benefits, but the danger is also great. Moreover, there are unknown dangers!"
Saying that, he shook his head and smiled. "You want benefits, but you don't want to put in any effort. It's human nature …"
Nanyue Qing suddenly said: "That Dao Scripture, must my Nanyue tribe obtain it?"
Nan Yue Xiu was silent.
Nan Yueqing said again, "If we don't have to, we don't have to get involved in this mess!"
Nanyue Xiu smiled: "Everyone understands this, but this Dao Canon is also an opportunity for our Nanyue Clan!
You know what?
Oftentimes, a single opportunity was enough to change an entire clan!
Although it might also cause the family to be consigned to eternal damnation!
But who doesn't want to give it a try? "
Nan Yueqing shook his head, "This Ye Xuan won't let us freeload!"
With that, he got up and left.
Inside the hall, Nanyue Xiu smiled, "It seems that this matter can only be decided by the Patriarch!"
This was a decision that concerned the rise and fall of the clan. It wasn't something that he or an elder could make a decision on their own.
Nan Yueqi nodded, "Let's go back first!"
With that, he and Nanyue Xiu got up and left.
Outside the hall, Nanyue Xiu smiled and said, "Elder Qi, you go back first!
I want to take a stroll in this universe! "
Nan Yueqi glanced at Nanyue Xiu and nodded, "Be careful!"
With that, he turned around and disappeared.
....
Sword Hall.
After Ye Xuan returned to Sword Hall, Yue Zun and the others were still studying Dao Scripture.
At first, it was research, but now it's a discussion!
Nian Nian was also quietly listening.
Ye Xuan walked to Nian Nian and sat down. Seeing Ye Xuan, Nian Nian suddenly showed a bright smile. Her right hand naturally hugged Ye Xuan's arm.
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "Do you understand?"
Nian Nian blinked, "I understand!"
Ye Xuan was stunned.
Nian Nian looked at Yue Zun and the others in the distance, "They said something wrong!"
Everyone in the surroundings fell silent when they heard Nian Nian, and all of them looked at Nian Nian!
No one thought that Nian Nian was talking nonsense!
Who is this person?
She's a Fifth Dimension Tendo!
Ye Zhiming walked over to Nian Nian and smiled, "Where did we go wrong?"
Nian Nian blinked, and then looked at Ye Xuan, "I …"
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "It's fine. Speak boldly!"
Nian Nian hesitated for a moment, and then pointed at a Dao Scripture, "This Dao Scripture doesn't teach people how to attain Dao, but how to understand Dao!
Because we are a part of Dao, but we just don't know it!
Dao is ourselves, but many people don't know this and still seek it everywhere … "
At this point, she glanced at everyone, and when she saw that everyone was looking at her, she hurriedly lowered her head.
At the side, an old man from Whirling Sect said in a trembling voice, "You … please continue …"
Nian Nian glanced at Ye Xuan, and Ye Xuan smiled lightly and encouraged her, "Continue!"
Nian Nian hesitated for a moment, and then she nodded, "This scroll only tells us what Dao is … and how to understand and recognize Dao. It doesn't teach you how to attain Dao, because you are a part of Dao, but you just don't know enough."
As she spoke, she glanced at everyone in the hall, "The direction of your research is wrong!"
The hall was silent.
Ye Xuan also fell silent.
The direction was wrong!
What is Dao?
Actually, we are a part of Dao!
We don't need to find how to attain Dao, but to find a way to understand ourselves. Understanding ourselves is to understand Dao!
After understanding Dao, is there still a need to attain Dao?
At this moment, Nian Nian pointed at the first Dao Scripture, "Escape … The escape mentioned in this scroll doesn't mean that you have to escape from the Dao, because even if you escape, you will still be within Dao!"
Ye Zhiming asked, "Why?"
Nian Nian looked at Ye Zhiming, "Because you are Dao, where can you escape to?"
Ye Zhiming frowned slightly, "Then what is Escape One referring to?"
Nian Nian smiled, "This Escape One refers to uncertainty."
"Uncertainty!"
Everyone looked at Nian Nian, and one of the old men said respectfully, "Your Excellency, what does uncertainty mean?"
Nian Nian grinned, "Uncertainty is fate, fate is also one of the Dao, but fate is uncertain!
For example, what family you were born in, what environment you were born in, these are uncertain, but you can change fate, control fate, in other words, Escape One.
Through hard work, you can change yourself, become that Escape One, but you are still within Dao, just that you already have the ability to control your own fate. "
Ye Zhiming said solemnly, "In other words, no matter what we do, we are still within Dao?"
Nian Nian nodded, "From this scroll, that's the case!
Because you are a part of Dao!
Speaking of this … "
At this point, she hesitated, then said, "But, if you are very, very strong, you can defy Dao!"
Ye Zhiming was a little confused, "Defy Dao?"
Nian Nian nodded, "Dao exists, but it can be defied, broken, and even destroyed …"
Ye Zhiming said solemnly, "How to defy?
How to break?
How to destroy? "
Nian Nian blinked, "I don't know!"
Ye Zhiming, "…"
Ye Xuan shook his head with a smile, "Then what do you know?"
Nian Nian giggled, "I only know this much!"
Ye Xuan, "…"
At this time, Venerable Yue suddenly said, "Why don't we let her help us?"
Ye Xuan looked at Venerable Yue, and Venerable Yue said solemnly, "Her understanding of these Dao Scriptures far surpasses ours!
With her help, we can better understand these Dao Scriptures, and then record them down. At that time, you can use the Dao Scriptures we have recorded to teach the experts of the Fifth Dimension, what do you think? "
Ye Xuan smiled, "Of course!"
As he spoke, he looked at Nian Nian, "Nian Nian, help them look at this Dao Scripture, okay?"
Nian Nian nodded, "Okay!"
Ye Xuan gently rubbed Nian Nian's little head. His intuition told him that Nian Nian was about to recover her memories!
Venerable Yue and the others continued to study the Dao Scriptures, while Ye Xuan came to a courtyard. He sat cross-legged on the ground and slowly closed his eyes.
Instant Kill Sword!
This was what Situ Tingyun had taught him before she left!
Previously, he had been busy and did not have the time to cultivate it. Now, he decided to cultivate this sword technique!
Like what Bai Dizi said, was the crisis really resolved?
No!
This might just be the beginning!
No matter what, like what Bai Dizi said, his top priority now was to increase his strength!
Only with great strength could he face everything!
Instant Kill Sword!
One Sword, One Kill!
After understanding this Instant Kill Sword, Ye Xuan's expression gradually became solemn … This sword technique's strength far surpassed his imagination!
It could be said that it was the most suitable sword technique for him to cultivate!
The Single Sword of Life and Death and Single Sword of Soul were taught to him by the plain-dressed woman. However, the strength of these two sword techniques depended on his sword dao cultivation and realm. Evidently, his current sword dao cultivation and realm were not enough to display the true power of these two sword techniques!
However, this Instant Kill Sword was different!
This sword technique was just right for him to cultivate!
After a while, Ye Xuan started to study this sword technique …
...
Xuan City.
In the city lord's mansion, an old man quickly walked to a side hall.
The old man bowed respectfully towards the side hall. "City lord, I have investigated!"
A woman's voice came from inside the hall. "Speak!"
The old man said in a deep voice, "The plain-dressed senior in my Xuan City is the Dao Protector of the Fifth Dimension's Young Master Ye!"
After a moment of silence, the woman's voice came again. "Are you sure?"
The old man said in a deep voice, "Absolutely sure!"
Creak!
The door suddenly opened and a woman walked out.
The old man hurriedly lowered his head, not daring to look at the woman.
The woman looked towards the sky and said softly, "His Dao Protector …"
At this time, the old man said again, "The Dao Sect's Second Brother sent someone to Xuan City, saying that he hopes that we can deal with Young Master Ye together. After the matter is done, he will share the Dao Scripture with us!"
The woman said softly, "Share the Dao Scripture … What a tempting condition!"
The old man said, "City lord, are you going to agree to the Dao Sect?"
The woman walked into the distance. "Prepare a big gift and send it over personally!
You will personally deliver it. You understand what I mean, right? "
The old man was stunned and then said, "To the Dao Sect?"
The woman stopped and turned to look at the old man. "Can you take that woman's sword?"
The old man was speechless.
The woman asked again, "Can my Xuan City take that woman's sword?"
The old man was speechless.
The woman blinked. "Since you can't, then why are you asking such a stupid question!
Of course, the gift is for Young Master Ye!
Remember, don't be stingy. Also, send some pills and whatnot. Let him feel the great kindness of our Xuan City, understand? "
The old man was speechless.
.....
...
PS: Can you let me feel your great kindness?
I'm looking forward to it!







Chapter 1443
The woman slowly walked to the front of a pool, and the old man stood respectfully behind her.
From the beginning until the end, the old man hadn't even raised his head to look at her!
It was out of respect, but it was also out of fear!
The woman wore a white robe with a violet ribbon tied around her waist, and she had a graceful and slender figure.
She sat on a rock by the side of the pool, and she gazed at the pool before her. A school of small fish had surrounded her.
The woman looked at the school of wandering fish, and her thoughts had already drifted away.
The woman in a plain dress!
At this moment, her mind was filled with that woman in a plain dress.
On that day, a woman in a plain dress had entered Xuan City and instantly killed 3 extraordinary experts of Xuan City right in front of her.
Those 3 extraordinary experts of Xuan City couldn't even withstand a single attack from that woman!
Terror!
She'd never felt terror in her entire life!
But on that day, she'd felt terror for the first time!
What was the greatest taboo on the path of the Martial Dao?
Naturally, it was fear!
She'd challenged the woman in a plain dress!
However, she hadn't been able to withstand a single attack from the woman!
After the woman attacked, it wasn't terror that she felt, it was despair!
At that instant, it was the first time she'd felt so weak.
However, the woman in a plain dress hadn't killed her!
The woman opened her palm, and there was a portrait there.
It was of Ye Xuan!
The woman had left it for her!
The woman gazed at the portrait and spoke softly, "The person in the portrait is in the Fifth Dimension?"
The old man nodded. "Yes!"
As he spoke, he hesitated for a moment before he continued, "According to my investigations, this Young Master Ye has gathered all 9 scrolls of the Dao Scriptures."
The Dao Scriptures!
The woman grinned. "Gathering the Dao Scriptures …. That's quite interesting."
The old man spoke in a low voice, "Moreover, this Young Master Ye has become the Lord of Daoting, and he was personally chosen by Lord Qing!"
The woman's beautiful brows knit together when she heard this.
The old man said, "Lord Qing's objective isn't simple at all!"
The woman said, "Who destroyed the Dark Abyss?"
The old man spoke in a low voice, "A woman in a white robe. She headed to the Dark Abyss and shattered it with a single punch …. Her origins and identity can't be found!"
The woman looked at the old man, "Even we can't find anything?"
The old man nodded. "Yes!"
The woman said softly, "From this, it can be seen that there is a huge force behind this Young Master Ye."
The old man nodded. "Yes!
Especially Young Master Ye's bloodline. His bloodline is extremely special, and its origin is untraceable. "
After a moment of silence, the woman asked softly, "Is there any movement from the Dao Sect and that place?"
The old man shook his head. "There's no movement!
However, they should already be investigating Ye Xuan. "
As he spoke, he hesitated for a moment before he said, "Will the Daoist Sect and that place let the matter rest?"
The woman shook her head. "I won't!"
The old man frowned slightly. "Do they still dare to target Young Master Ye?"
The woman looked at the pool in front of her and said softly, "Why not?
Just a white-robed woman and a Swordsman woman won't be able to scare them. As for the plain-dressed woman … I think they probably don't know her true strength! "
The old man hesitated for a moment before he said, "Should I remind the Gate of Dao and that place?"
The woman glanced at the old man. "Do you think they'll believe it?"
The old man was silent.
The woman chuckled. "Don't talk about them, even we won't believe it."
As she spoke, she raised her head to look at the horizon and said softly, "Because she's so strong that it's beyond our understanding."
The old man said, "If we become friends with Young Master Ye … I'm afraid the Gate of Dao and that place will …"
The woman recollected her thoughts, stood up, and walked into the distance. "We can provide some help and information to Young Master Ye. As long as we don't send experts to the Fifth Dimension to help him, whether it's the Gate of Dao or that place, they won't say anything."
The old man nodded. "Understood!"
The woman said again, "It's not convenient for me to go to the Fifth Dimension. I'll leave this matter to you."
The old man bowed slightly. "Don't worry, City Lord. This old servant will definitely take care of it!"
As he spoke, he seemed to have thought of something and said, "Some forces might not be that friendly towards Young Master Ye …"
The woman said, "That's their problem!"
As she spoke, she walked into the distance. "When you go, bring a big gift.
Of course, if there's anything he needs help with, try your best to satisfy him. After all, the Gate of Dao and that place haven't started fighting yet. You can help however you want! "
The old man nodded. "Understood!"
...
In the Fifth Dimension.
Inside the palace.
Ye Xuan had been meditating for three days. In these three days, he didn't even take a step out of his room.
He was studying that instant killing sword!
While Ye Xuan was meditating, some especially powerful auras appeared in the starry sky of the Fifth Dimension.
This made Bai Dizi quite worried.
He knew that some mysterious forces that even the Daoting had never heard of had appeared.
Just like the Nanyue family!
The complete version of the Dao scripture was too tempting!
Which force wouldn't be tempted!
More and more mysterious experts came to the Fifth Dimension. Fortunately, no one dared to act recklessly!
The current Five Dimensional Universe was still very intimidating!
After all, the Dark Abyss had just been destroyed and the Whirling World had surrendered.
Before figuring out Ye Xuan's background, no one dared to act rashly.
...
Inside the Sword Palace.
Yue Zun and the rest were still studying the Dao scripture. Unlike before, with the addition of Nian Nian, their progress was godly!
A total of seven Dao scriptures were annotated by them in detail. Not only that, the Dao scriptures, martial arts, and mental cultivation methods were also listed out for people to cultivate.
The difficulty of the last two Dao scriptures was higher. Even Nian Nian would fall into deep thought because of a single sentence. After all, she hadn't fully recovered her memories.
As for Ye Xuan, he was cultivating in seclusion.
Three days later, Ye Xuan suddenly left his room. He turned into a sword light and disappeared.
Not long later, Ye Xuan came to a certain starry sky. After confirming that there was no one around, Ye Xuan stopped. He opened his palm and the Executing Heaven Sword appeared in his hand.
Ye Xuan suddenly looked into the distance. The next moment, thousands of feet away, the space there was torn apart and a sword light appeared!
Instant killing sword!
A smile appeared on Ye Xuan's face when he saw this.
Instant killing a Swordsman wasn't difficult, but it wasn't easy to cultivate it to Situ Tingyun's level!
Speed!
This Instant Kill Sword was all about speed and the element of surprise!
It was simply too suitable for him!
In the following time, Ye Xuan started to cultivate Instant killing sword like crazy. He wanted to raise the speed of Instant killing sword to the limit!
Situ Tingyun could kill people two levels above her, so could he!
Moreover, he had the Dao Body and the Naga Dragon Clan's power, the Dao Law of Space, and the Sword Domain …
It could be said that he had a great innate advantage when cultivating Instant killing sword!
...
In the Fifth Dimension, a black-robed old man looked down from the sky.
At this moment, a middle-aged man suddenly appeared near the black-robed old man. The middle-aged man glanced at the black-robed old man and smiled. "Boundless Sacred Land!"
The black-robed old man glanced at the middle-aged man. "Dao Sect!"
The middle-aged man smiled. "Yes!"
The black-robed old man retracted his gaze and continued to look down. No one knew what he was thinking.
The middle-aged man smiled. "This Qing Zhu really has a good eye!
Changing masters with one move, bringing Daoting back to life! "
The black-robed old man was expressionless. "A deathbed struggle!"
The middle-aged man glanced at the black-robed old man and smiled. "That doesn't seem right.
Sir, this universe is going to have the power of faith again! "
The black-robed old man fell silent.
The middle-aged man said again, "Not only did Qing Zhu give the Dao Seal to Ye Xuan, but he also gave his Destiny God Seal to him … Sir, are you guys panicking?"
The black-robed old man glanced at the middle-aged man. "Your Dao Sect's precious Dao Scripture has fallen into someone else's hands. Don't you feel ashamed?"
The smile on the middle-aged man's face gradually disappeared.
The black-robed old man said again, "When An Yuan was destroyed, your ancestor didn't even dare to fart. If I were you, I would be too embarrassed to come out and embarrass myself!"
The middle-aged man laughed. "Didn't the Boundless Sacred Ground say that you guys will kill whoever dares to cultivate the power of faith?
Look, Ye Xuan is not only cultivating the power of faith, but he is also rebuilding the order and letting the three thousand Dao Guardians cultivate the power of faith. Go kill him now! "
The black-robed old man looked at the middle-aged man with killing intent in his eyes.
The middle-aged man smiled. "Sir, it's meaningless for us to fight against each other!
How about we talk about cooperation? "
The black-robed old man was expressionless. "What cooperation!"
The middle-aged man smiled. "Both of us want Ye Xuan dead, right?"
The black-robed old man kept silent.
The middle-aged man continued, "But, for now, we have to deal with the mysterious force behind Ye Xuan first!
Both Dao Sect and the Boundless Sacred Ground know nothing about the force behind him, right? "
The black-robed old man didn't say anything.
The middle-aged man continued, "Ye Xuan has obtained the Scripture of Dao. I believe it won't take long for him to understand the nine volumes of Scripture of Dao and summon the Spirit of Dao. Once the Spirit of Dao appears, it will be very difficult for us to kill him even if the person behind him doesn't show up!
What's more, Qing Zhu handed the Daoting to Ye Xuan. Once the order is built, those who were exiled by you guys might get the power of faith again … "
The black-robed old man's eyes turned gloomy.
The middle-aged man said, "Now, we have to admit that both Dao Sect and the Boundless Sacred Ground will not be able to deal with the person behind Ye Xuan alone!
But what if we join hands? "
The black-robed old man glanced at the middle-aged man. "You still don't understand the situation. We don't even know what the force behind him is. And the mysterious force that even you and we don't know … Do you know what it means?
It means the person behind him might come from a place that we don't even know. "
The middle-aged man smiled. "He said he is the Son of the Nine-Dimensional Plane!"
The black-robed old man sneered. "Do you think it's funny?"
The middle-aged man frowned. The black-robed old man said again, "How can you be so sure that what he said is false?
Just because we haven't been to the Nine-Dimensional Plane, we think there is no Nine-Dimensional Plane, right? "
As he said, he raised his head and looked deep into the starry sky. He said softly, "What if he is really the Son of the Nine-Dimensional Plane?"
The middle-aged man looked at the black-robed old man. "So, the Boundless Sacred Ground is going to give up?"
The black-robed old man glanced at the middle-aged man. "We just don't want to underestimate him. Of course, if the force behind him is too powerful, we have to give up."
After that, he turned around and left.
.....







Chapter 1444
In the starry sky, the middle-aged man was silent.
At this moment, a voice came from behind him, "They will not let Ye Xuan live!"
The middle-aged man turned around. When he saw who it was, he quickly bowed respectfully, "Court Head!"
Taoism was divided into Wuyuan Court and Wenyuan Court. The person in front of him was the Court Head of Wenyuan Court, Wen Tianyu.
Wen Tianyu nodded slightly, "No need to be so polite."
The middle-aged man hesitated and said, "Court Head Wen, the Boundless Sacred Land …"
Wen Tianyu smiled and said, "The Boundless Sacred Land cultivates the Power of Faith. The Power of Faith is their foundation. The Daoting also cultivates the Power of Faith. There is an irreconcilable conflict between them and the Daoting."
The middle-aged man asked softly, "Why?"
Wen Tianyu smiled and said, "The Daoting's Power of Faith is to establish order for all living beings, to create peace and make the world a better place!
The reason why the Daoting was so powerful was that their Power of Faith was very pure. Moreover, it was the voluntary belief of the people in the world.
But the Boundless Sacred Land is different. Their Power of Faith is based on brainwashing and slavery. The Boundless Sacred Land has hundreds of countries. Each country is their slave. Their Power of Faith is based on brainwashing and deception. "
Then, he shook his head and smiled, "The Boundless Sacred Land is afraid!"
Wen Tianyu said in a deep voice, "Why did the Daoting lose?"
Wen Tianyu smiled and said, "Because the Daoting has affected the interests of some people!"
The middle-aged man asked, "Who?"
Wen Tianyu smiled and said, "Us!"
The middle-aged man was stunned.
Wen Tianyu looked down and said softly, "They establish order with the Three Thousand Great Dao. The core of the Three Thousand Great Dao is the Dao Scripture and the Dao Spirit. They want to awaken the Dao Spirit … We Taoism will not let them awaken the Dao Spirit."
The middle-aged man hesitated and did not ask.
It was better not to know some secrets!
Wen Tianyu said softly, "It is not that we have to be enemies with Ye Xuan. But his rise will seriously threaten our interests and even overthrow us!
So, we have no choice. "
The middle-aged man said in a deep voice, "The force behind Ye Xuan …"
Wen Tianyu looked down and said softly, "If it's just those two women, it's actually not that big of a problem … I'm just afraid that there's someone even more powerful than those two women behind him. Although this possibility is very small … it's not impossible!
There was no hope!
Otherwise … "
At this point, he didn't continue.
...
On the other side, in the starry sky, Ye Xuan opened his palm, and the Executing Heaven Sword fell into his hand.
At this time, he had trained his Instant Kill Swordsman skill to the extreme!
Although he was only in the Dao Defense Realm, he was confident that he could kill a Consolidation Realm expert with a single strike. Of course, that was under the condition that he caught his opponent off guard. The key to this instant kill was to catch his opponent off guard!
As if a thought had crossed his mind, Ye Xuan opened his palm, revealing a Storage Ring in his hand.
This was given to him by the white-robed Qing'er before he left!
There was no treasure in the storage ring, but rather a map!
It was a map of an unknown place!
After looking at the map for a moment, Ye Xuan said softly, "Looks like I have to find some time to go there!"
Since this was left to him by the white-robed Qing'er, this place would definitely be of great help to him.
At this time, Bai Dizi suddenly appeared in front of Ye Xuan.
Ye Xuan put away the map and looked at Bai Dizi. Bai Dizi said in a deep voice, "People from Xuan City have come!"
Xuan City!
Ye Xuan frowned slightly, "What kind of force is it?"
Bai Dizi shook his head, "I don't know!
However, I've already investigated. What I know is that not only Xuan City, but some mysterious forces have also come to our Fifth Dimension. Some people have already shown themselves, but there are still many people hiding in the dark! "
Ye Xuan said softly, "They should all be here for the Dao Scripture!"
Bai Dizi nodded, "I made a decision on my own!"
Ye Xuan asked with a smile, "What is it?"
Bai Dizi said, "I have already asked all the experts from the Dao Returning College, Xuanji Sect, Xiao Clan, and Xuanhuan Sect to come to the Fifth Dimension.
Currently, we have 46 Consolidation Realm experts, 760 Dao Attainment Realm experts, and thousands of Dao Controlling Realm experts! "
Ye Xuan asked, "All of them are here?"
Bai Dizi nodded, "Almost all of them are here!
After all, there is a complete version of the Dao Scripture here, who wouldn't want to come? "
At this point, he seemed to have thought of something and said, "There is one thing I have to tell you!"
Ye Xuan said, "Speak!"
Bai Dizi said in a deep voice, "The reason why the Daoting Qing Zhu and the others suddenly disappeared was not because they disappeared on their own, but because the Daoting encountered a strong enemy. However, the Daoting has no records of these past events, even I don't know much!
Now, we need to rebuild order, I am worried … "
Ye Xuan said softly, "You are worried that the forces that caused the Daoting experts to disappear will not accept us!"
Bai Dizi nodded, "Yes!"
Ye Xuan was silent.
Bai Dizi said in a deep voice, "I think you can meet some hidden forces. If you can befriend them, it will be very beneficial for us!"
Ye Xuan nodded, "I understand!"
Bai Dizi was about to speak, at this moment, the space in front of him trembled, Bai Dizi looked up at Ye Xuan, "Miss Guan Yin said that the people of Xuan City are waiting for you!"
Xuan City!
Ye Xuan said with a smile, "Come, let's go meet them!"
Bai Dizi nodded.
The two left.
...
Dao City, Sword Hall.
As soon as Ye Xuan entered the hall, an old man immediately stood up. The old man cupped his fists towards Ye Xuan and said with a smile, "Young Master Ye, I am Xuan City's Zhao Yan, a butler of Xuan City's City Lord."
Butler!
Ye Xuan glanced at Zhao Yan, this Zhao Yan's strength was at least at the peak of Consolidation Realm.
This kind of expert was only a butler!
Ye Xuan said with a smile, "Senior Zhao, please sit!"
Zhao Yan said with a smile, "Young Master Ye, please sit!"
Ye Xuan smiled, "Senior, please sit!"
Zhao Yan hurriedly shook his head, "Young Master Ye, please sit!"
Ye Xuan blinked and said with a smile, "Senior, then let's be casual!
What do you think? "
Zhao Yan said with a smile, "Just what I want!"
The two sat down.
Ye Xuan looked at Zhao Yan, "Senior, did you come to my Fifth Dimension for the Dao Scripture?"
Zhao Yan shook his head, "No, no, we came to the Fifth Dimension this time just to get to know Young Master Ye!"
Ye Xuan looked at Zhao Yan, "Not for the Dao Scripture?"
Zhao Yan said with a smile, "Indeed not for the Dao Scripture!
To be honest, my Xuan City's City Lord wanted to personally come here to get to know Young Master Ye, but now is a special time. If she comes to the Fifth Dimension, it might be a little disadvantageous to Young Master Ye, so she asked me to come see Young Master Ye.
To put it simply, my Xuan City wants to be friends with Young Master Ye! "
Ye Xuan said with a smile, "Senior, what you said makes me a little confused!
Can you be more frank? "
Zhao Yan hesitated for a moment, then said, "Young Master Ye, I have already been very frank!"
Ye Xuan looked at Zhao Yan, "Xuan City wants to be friends with me?"
Zhao Yan nodded.
Ye Xuan suddenly asked, "Has Qing 'er been to your place?"
"Qing 'er!"
Zhao Yan was stunned, "Who?"
Ye Xuan said, "A woman in a plain dress!"
Hearing this, Zhao Yan immediately stood up, he hesitated for a moment, then said, "So it's that senior …"
Ye Xuan nodded, "Yes."
Zhao Yan said with a bitter smile, "Young Master Ye guessed correctly, that senior has indeed been to our Xuan City!"
Ye Xuan was silent.
He didn't expect that his guess would really be correct.
Qing 'er has really been to Xuan City!
Needless to say, the reason these fellows came to the Fifth Dimension to be friends with me is definitely because of Qing 'er!
Ye Xuan withdrew his thoughts and looked at Zhao Yan, "Senior, did anything unpleasant happen between you and Qing 'er?"
Zhao Yan hurriedly said, "There was a little in the beginning, but it was a misunderstanding. We have already cleared up the misunderstanding!"
Ye Xuan, "…"
Zhao Yan suddenly took out a spatial ring and placed it in front of Ye Xuan, "Young Master Ye, this is a small token of my Xuan City, please accept it, Young Master Ye!"
Ye Xuan glanced at the spatial ring, and his expression changed!
There were a total of 50 million Divine Fortune Crystals in the spatial ring!
Not only that, there were also some medicinal pills, and there was no need to look at them to know that they were extremely precious!
Ye Xuan didn't accept the spatial ring, he looked at Zhao Yan, "Senior, there is no such thing as an undeserved reward. I cannot accept this gift."
Zhao Yan was stunned, he didn't expect that Ye Xuan would actually refuse!
Zhao Yan said, "Young Master Ye, this is a small token of my appreciation, Young Master Ye …"
Ye Xuan smiled, "Senior, this is not a small token of my appreciation, this is a very big gift.
Xuan City wants to be on good terms with me, Ye Xuan, and I am naturally more than happy to do so. As for this gift … please accept it, Senior!
Also, please tell your Castellan that I, Ye Xuan, will visit another day. "
Xuan City's goodwill was because of Qing 'er, he was very clear on this point.
He was naturally happy that Qing 'er helped him, but he wouldn't use Qing' er's power to do whatever he wanted.
Zhao Yan wanted to say something, but Ye Xuan suddenly looked at Bai Dizi, "Bai Di Xing Jun, help me get a copy of the Daoist scriptures and annotations copied by Zhiming and the others."
Bai Di Xing Jun glanced at Ye Xuan, then turned and left. Soon, he reappeared in the hall, holding an ancient scroll in his hand.
Ye Xuan took the scroll and handed it to Zhao Yan, smiling, "This is the contents and annotations of the first seven Daoist scriptures. Today, I will give them to Xuan City!
This is equivalent to making a good karma! "
Zhao Yan smiled bitterly, "Young Master Ye, you didn't accept my gift, but still gave me such a precious thing. This Old Man doesn't dare to accept it, I …"
Ye Xuan smiled, "Take it back to the Castellan of Xuan City, and tell her that I, Ye Xuan, have received her kindness.
Also, I am very willing to be friends with Xuan City! "
Zhao Yan hesitated, then said, "I will!"
Ye Xuan nodded.
After Zhao Yan left with the scroll, Bai Dizi looked at Ye Xuan, "I suddenly thought of something!"
Ye Xuan was a little curious, "What is it?"
Bai Dizi said, "I sent someone to kill the plain-dressed girl!"
As he spoke, he suddenly slapped himself. "I'm too f * cking stupid!"
Ye Xuan: "…"
....
PS: I have a dream recently, I dreamed that many people rushed to vote for me … I didn't want them, but they still voted for me … Then I became the first in the monthly votes!
And it was more than ten times more than the second place … and I have been on the list for more than ten months …







Chapter 1445
Within the hall, Bai Dizi sighed softly, and he had extremely complicated feelings in his heart.
What sort of power was Dark City?
He didn't know!
But could a power that could casually take out tens of millions of Divine Fortune Crystals as a gift be a small power?
Moreover, such a formidable power had expressed goodwill to the Fifth Dimension just because of a woman in a plain dress. It could even be said to be slightly lowly!
There was no need to think about it to know that the woman in a plain dress was absolutely formidable to the point of causing Dark City to feel despair!
Moreover, he'd even sent people to kill her!
When he thought up to here, he couldn't help but want to slap himself a few more times!
How could I have been so stupid all those years ago?
Ye Xuan suddenly said, "The important matter at hand is to figure out how many powers we don't know about, and we must figure out the ins and outs of these powers!"
Bai Dizi nodded, "Yes."
When he spoke up to here, he gazed at Ye Xuan, "Why didn't you ask Zhao Yan?"
Ye Xuan smiled, "He'll come back!"
Bai Dizi was slightly stunned, and then he took a deep glance at Ye Xuan, "Brilliant!"
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "I'll go see how their study of the Daoist Scripture is going!"
As soon as he finished speaking, he left the hall.
...
Dark City.
Zhao Yan stood respectfully in a garden somewhere, and a woman was playing chess not too far away from him. She had no opponent and was playing by herself.
A short moment later, the woman spoke softly, "He didn't accept the gift and even gave you the contents of the Daoist Scripture?"
Zhao Yan nodded, "Yes."
The woman chuckled, "Interesting!"
Zhao Yan hesitated for a moment and asked, "What does he mean by that?"
The woman smiled, "He means that he doesn't want to bully us!"
Zhao Yan came to an understanding when he heard this.
To put it bluntly, they'd definitely made friends with Ye Xuan because of the woman in a plain dress, and it was the same for the gift.
Moreover, Ye Xuan's actions were telling them that he, Ye Xuan, wouldn't bully others.
When he thought up to here, Zhao Yan couldn't help but have a good impression of Ye Xuan.
The woman suddenly put down the chess piece in her hand. She stood up and said with a smile, "You go again. You don't need to bring any gifts!"
Zhao Yan said softly, "Just like that?"
The woman nodded. "What he needs the most right now isn't worldly possessions, but an understanding of the various forces!
Send him a copy of the detailed information of all the forces! "
Zhao Yan hesitated for a moment, and then he said, "Taoism and the Boundless Holy Land?"
The woman smiled and said, "Even if we don't send him off, he will find out soon enough!"
Zhao Yan nodded, "Understood!"
He paused for a moment before continuing, "Our people are still investigating the people behind Young Master Ye. Should we continue investigating?"
The woman shook her head. "No need!"
Zhao Yan bowed respectfully and was about to leave. Meanwhile, the woman said, "Young Master Ye is at the Dao Control Realm now?"
Zhao Yan nodded, "Yes!
However, his aura is thick and vigorous. His battle prowess probably far surpasses that of ordinary Dao Attainment realm cultivators! "
After a moment of silence, the woman suddenly said, "Although he has the Dao Scripture, I'm afraid he still has some problems on how to reach the Dao …"
Zhao Yan hurriedly said, "I understand!"
Obviously, the City Lord wanted to help Ye Xuan reach the Dao Attainment realm.
After a moment, Zhao Yan left.
In the garden, the woman slowly closed her eyes and chuckled, "This might be the best chance for my Xuan City to rise …"
Because besides her, there was no one outside right now.
She knew how powerful the woman in a plain dress was!
While everyone was thinking about how to scheme against Ye Xuan, Xuan City was secretly helping Ye Xuan and establishing a friendly relationship … She didn't ask for any other benefits. In the future, a single word of advice from the woman in a plain dress would be enough to change the fate of an expert of her level!
...
In the Five-Dimensional Universe.
In the Sword Hall.
Everyone was surrounding Nian Nian. Nian Nian was reading the eighth Dao Scripture. She was reading it very carefully and would think from time to time.
While she was thinking, no one dared to breathe loudly for fear of disturbing Nian Nian.
At this moment, Ye Zhiming suddenly walked to Ye Xuan's side. She glanced at Nian Nian who was thinking in the distance and said softly, "Is she going to recover her memory?"
Ye Xuan shook his head, "I don't know!"
Ye Zhiming said in a deep voice, "I feel that she is a little different from before!"
Ye Xuan nodded. He looked at Nian Nian in the distance seriously. The current Nian Nian was indeed a little different from before.
But his intuition told him that Nian Nian might not recover her memory so easily!
If she deliberately lost her memory, then there must be a deeper meaning.
At this moment, Ye Zhiming suddenly said, "We have recorded the first to seventh Dao Scripture martial arts and excitement in detail!"
As she said that, she opened her palm and a scroll appeared in front of Ye Xuan, "This is the seventh Dao Scripture martial arts and Dao Scripture mental cultivation method!"
Ye Xuan opened the scroll and three large words appeared in front of him: Fen Tian Jue.
Ye Xuan frowned slightly, "Fen Tian Jue?"
Ye Zhiming nodded, "This is a palm technique. Its power is far above Dao Fist. One palm burning the heavens, if paired with this Dao Scripture mental cultivation method, its power can really destroy heaven and earth. Especially its power, it has a fatal restraining effect on the origin of the world."
As she said that, she looked at Ye Xuan, "This palm is very special, it is specially used to destroy the world. If you cultivate it, you must use it carefully!"
Ye Xuan opened the scroll and took a look. A moment later, his expression gradually became solemn.
The power of this Fen Tian Jue slightly exceeded his expectations!
Just as Ye Zhiming said, the lethality of this Dao Scripture martial arts was too terrifying!
If it was used in the Fifth Dimension, the Fifth Dimension might not be able to withstand it!
Because this Dao Scripture martial arts naturally countered the origin of the world. Once it was used, the origin of the Fifth Dimension would definitely die!
As if thinking of something, Ye Xuan looked at Nian Nian and the others in the distance, "Have the eighth and ninth Dao Scripture martial arts come out?"
Ye Zhiming shook her head, "Not yet!
However, there is some progress on the eighth Dao Scripture martial arts! "
Ye Xuan softly said, "The eighth Dao Scripture martial arts is probably even more terrifying than the ninth Dao Scripture martial arts!"
Ye Zhiming nodded, "Yes!"
As she said that, she hesitated for a moment before continuing, "The Whirling Sect …"
Ye Xuan smiled, "Are you trying to say that the Whirling Sect knows everything about the Dao Scripture?"
Ye Zhiming nodded.
Ye Xuan lightly smiled, "They gave me the ninth Dao Scripture martial arts, I still have to give them this bit of benefit, otherwise, I would be too much of a scum!"
Ye Zhiming nodded, "Good!
One more thing, the Dao Scripture martial arts and Dao Scripture mental cultivation methods that we have recorded … Are we going to give them to the experts of the Fifth Dimension to cultivate? "
Ye Xuan nodded, "Yes!
However, we can't give them to them casually!
Especially the Dao Scripture martial arts and mental cultivation methods, we can make them into a reward, so that everyone has a goal to pursue. If they get it too easily, they won't cherish it! "
Ye Zhiming smiled, "You are really too generous!"
Ye Xuan shook his head, "This is what I originally promised them!"
Ye Zhiming nodded, "Good!"
Ye Xuan glanced at Nian Nian and the others in the distance.
Then he said, "I will go and cultivate this Dao Scripture martial arts first!
If anything happens, call me at any time! "
After saying that, he turned around and left.
Not far away, Venerable Yue looked at the departing Ye Xuan in silence.
In fact, she was a little afraid!
Afraid that Ye Xuan wouldn't let the Whirling Sect study this Dao Scripture!
After all, the Dao Scripture martial arts and mental cultivation methods in this Dao Scripture were too precious!
However, she didn't expect that Ye Xuan still wouldn't let them leave!
It was very obvious that Ye Xuan was really willing to share all the Dao Scriptures with the Whirling Sect!
Thinking of this, Venerable Yue shook her head and smiled. At the beginning, she felt that giving the last Dao Scripture to Ye Xuan for free was not worth it.
However, now it seemed that this was simply too profitable!
The Whirling World only gave away one Dao Scripture, but they obtained eight Dao Scriptures!
At this moment, she suddenly felt that the Whirling World's forces and An Yuan were too stupid!
In fact, Ye Xuan didn't care too much about the Dao Scripture. If they wanted the Dao Scripture, they could totally cooperate with him!
After interacting with Ye Xuan, she realized that Ye Xuan was actually a very easy person to talk to!
If he was so easy to talk to, why did so many people still bully him?
Venerable Yue shook her head, she couldn't understand!
...
Somewhere in the starry sky, Ye Xuan scanned his surroundings. This was a dead star field without any signs of life. This place was the most suitable for cultivation.
Ye Xuan opened his palm and the seventh Dao Scripture martial art appeared in his hand.
Burning Heaven Extinction!
Ye Xuan took a deep breath and opened his palm. Soon, a mysterious force suddenly appeared around him!
The seventh Dao Scripture mental cultivation method!
Every Dao Scripture martial art had to be paired with a mental cultivation method in order to unleash its true power. Therefore, he first cultivated the seventh mental cultivation method!
Mental cultivation methods were easy to learn. In a short while, Ye Xuan had mastered the Dao Scripture mental cultivation method. Next, he began to cultivate Burning Heaven Extinction.
Ye Xuan sat cross-legged in the starry sky. The starry sky around him was dead silent.
After sitting quietly like this for an unknown period of time, Ye Xuan suddenly opened his right hand. His palm was like a piece of magma. It was dark red. Soon, a powerful force appeared around him and the starry sky around him began to tremble!
At this moment, Ye Xuan suddenly stood up slowly. He frowned and his right hand trembled violently. At this moment, he felt that his right hand was like a volcano!
That force was too violent!
Not only that, he felt as if his right hand was burning!
Ye Xuan's expression became somewhat solemn!
He realized that he had underestimated this Burning Heaven Extinction!
From the beginning, he knew that this Burning Heaven Extinction's force was overbearing and ordinary people couldn't withstand it. However, he had a Dao Physique!
Moreover, it was an upgraded Dao Physique!
But at this moment, he realized that it was still not enough!
The seventh Dao Scripture martial art was too overbearing!
He had to suppress it!
Otherwise, this force would cripple him!
Ye Xuan began to use his own force to suppress it. However, he realized that it was useless!
Moreover, the more he suppressed it with his Sword Dao, the more powerful the violent force became!
Soon, Ye Xuan's right hand began to crack!
Seeing this scene, Ye Xuan's expression changed greatly. He didn't think too much and hurriedly activated his bloodline power. Soon, countless amounts of blood in his body converged towards his right hand. When the blood converged on his right hand.
Boom!
In his right hand, the overbearing force immediately quieted down!
It became obedient!
Ye Xuan: "…"
..







Chapter 1446
In the starry sky, Ye Xuan was stunned.
He really did not expect his bloodline power to be able to suppress this violent power!
It seemed that his bloodline had many functions!
Ye Xuan collected his thoughts and continued to cultivate Absolute Fen Tian.
Since he could use his bloodline to suppress it, it meant that he could control the power of Absolute Fen Tian. If that was the case, it would be much easier!
...
Boundless Sacred Land.
Boundless Sacred Land was located in Boundless Star Region. This star region was a bit special because it was different from other places. This place cultivated the power of faith!
In Boundless Sacred Land, there were hundreds of super empires. These hundreds of super empires were all subsidiary countries of the sacred land!
Faith in the sacred land!
What was different from Daoting was that the faith here was completely enslaved. From birth, people were instilled to believe in the sacred land and to go through fire and water for the sacred land …
Here, the sacred land was god!
An inviolable god!
On this day, a man came to Boundless Star Region.
This person was the head of the Daoist faction, Wen Tian Yu.
Just as Wen Tian Yu stepped into Boundless Star Region, a golden light suddenly appeared in front of him. The golden light dissipated and an old man wearing a golden robe appeared in front of Wen Tian Yu.
Wen Tian Yu smiled and said, "Master Bi Xiu, long time no see. How have you been?"
Master Bi Xiu slightly bowed, "Head Wen, long time no see. Compared to back then, you have become even stronger!"
Wen Tian Yu shook his head and smiled, "Master must be joking!"
Master Bi Xiu looked at Wen Tian Yu, "Are you here for the Fifth Dimension's Ye Xuan?"
Wen Tian Yu nodded.
Master Bi Xiu shook his head, "This matter is not something that you and I can decide!"
Wen Tian Yu smiled and said, "I represent the Daoist faction!"
Master Bi Xiu glanced at Wen Tian Yu, "The Daoist faction's Four Sages, do you represent four?"
Wen Tian Yu was silent.
Master Bi Xiu smiled and said, "It seems that Head Wen only represents the Daoist faction's Earth Gate!"
The Daoist faction's Four Sages had their own legacies. They were Heaven Gate, Earth Gate, Xuan Gate, and Human Gate.
Among them, Second Elder Dao was the Earth Gate's ancestor!
Wen Tianyu smiled. "Even if I only represent Earth's Gate, isn't that enough?"
Master Bixiu shook his head. "Court Head Wen, the white-robed woman shattered the Dark Abyss with a single punch. A Consolidation Realm expert is like an ant in front of her … Moreover, we still don't know how strong she is. Do you think it's enough?"
Wen Tianyu shook his head and smiled, "Since that's the case, then the Holy Land can just wait!
Wait for the rise of this Young Master Ye! "
After saying this, he turned around and left. After taking two steps, he suddenly stopped and turned around to look at Master Bi Xiu. "Master, you should really go to the Fifth Dimension to take a look at the power of faith there. I believe that Master will definitely be very surprised!
Furthermore, Ye Xuan was personally chosen by Master Qing. He would definitely save that Master Qing in the future. At that time, what would the Holy Lands do?
Surrender?
Haha … "
With that, he turned around and left.
The Master of Bisu was silent.
At this moment, a voice suddenly sounded above Wen Tianyu's head. "Where's Second Brother Dao?"
Hearing this, the Master of Cultivation's expression changed, and he hurriedly bowed respectfully.
This was because the person who spoke was the Holy Land's Holy Leader!
Wen Tianyu also bowed slightly. Towards this mysterious Holy Leader, he did not dare to show the slightest bit of disrespect.
Wen Tianyu was about to speak, but at this moment, a shadow suddenly appeared in the sky behind him.
Second Brother Dao!
Following the appearance of Second Brother Dao, a middle-aged man wearing a white robe appeared above the Master of Bisu.
Holy Leader!
Both of them had appeared!
The Holy Leader looked at Second Brother Dao. "You've seen that woman!"
Second Brother Dao nodded.
The Holy Leader asked, "What realm?"
Second Brother Dao shook his head. "I don't know!"
The Holy Leader frowned.
"I don't know?"
Second Brother Dao nodded.
The Holy Leader's expression was calm. No one knew what he was thinking.
Second Brother Dao looked at the Holy Leader. "The price of killing these two people is too great!
If we don't kill them, the price will be even greater! "
The Holy Leader was expressionless. "If we don't kill them, what's the price?"
Second Brother Dao smiled. "First, let's talk about the price of my Dao Faction!
He has already obtained the nine scrolls of Dao scriptures. Once he comprehends the nine scrolls of Dao scriptures, his strength will undergo an earth-shattering change. Most importantly, it is very likely that he will awaken the Spirit of Dao and become the Master of our Dao Faction. "
As he spoke, he shook his head and smiled. "If he is personally chosen by Master, I have nothing to say. However, he is not. Moreover, the people behind him are all Dao Defiant cultivators. It is obvious that he is not on the same path as our Dao Faction!
Therefore, we will not let him become the Master of our Dao Faction. Moreover, we will not let him grasp the Spirit of Dao. "
The Holy Leader looked at Second Brother Dao. "You?
Two or three?
Or four? "
Second Brother Dao smiled. "Fourth Junior Brother and I have reached a consensus!
As for Third Junior Sister, she has been wandering outside all year round. We do not know where she is now.
As for Eldest Senior Brother, he has become obsessed with that Dao Faction. He basically does not care about anything!
Therefore, Fourth Junior Brother and I are in charge of the Dao Faction now. "
The Holy Leader said softly, "Tell us about our Sacred Ground's loss!"
Second Brother Dao laughed. "Holy Leader, why do you ask when you already know the answer?"
The Holy Leader looked at Second Brother. "I want to hear it!"
Second Brother Dao looked straight at the Holy Leader. "He will subvert the Sacred Ground's Power of Faith!
Am I right? "
The Holy Leader was silent.
Second Brother Dao continued, "Moreover, he is the person chosen by Master Qing. Holy Leader, do you dare to let Master Qing and her Great Dao Guardians come out?
I think you definitely do not dare!
Back then, Master Qing almost subverted your Boundless Sacred Ground. Now, there is another Ye Xuan … "
The Holy Leader said softly, "Second Brother Dao, Ye Xuan is not like Master Qing. We will have to pay a huge price to deal with two women who are not in the same realm. Most importantly, we do not know how many people are behind him!"
Second Brother Dao said softly, "Currently, we know that the white-robed woman, Situ Tingyun, the Nether World Hall in the four-dimensional universe, and a woman in a plain dress who is his Dao Guardian!
These people had once appeared to help him! "
The Holy Leader said, "Who is the easiest to kill?"
Second Brother Dao said after a moment of silence, "It might be that woman in a plain dress!"
The Holy Leader asked, "Why do you think so?"
Second Brother Dao said, "I have investigated this person. Her true strength has always been a mystery. However, the Fifth Dimension's Tendo, Mu Niannian, said that she has a 50% chance of defeating the woman in a plain dress. Moreover, she said this more than once!"
The Holy Leader frowned. "50% chance?"
Second Brother Dao nodded. "The Fifth Dimension's Tendo has said more than once that she has a 50% chance of defeating the woman in a plain dress. An expert of her level should not speak carelessly.
Moreover, this time, when the Fifth Dimension and Ye Xuan are in danger, this woman in a plain dress did not appear. Why did she not appear?
There are two possibilities. The first is that she does not know that the Fifth Dimension and Ye Xuan are in danger. However, this possibility is extremely small.
The second possibility is that her strength is not enough to deal with the crisis of the Fifth Dimension and Ye Xuan. Therefore, she does not dare to come.
Based on this, among the people behind Ye Xuan, this woman in a plain dress is the easiest to kill! "
The Holy Leader was silent.
Second Brother Dao continued, "There is one more thing. Previously, I asked the Daoting Taoist Ancestor to search for this woman in a plain dress. Although the Taoist Ancestor is dead, before he died, he told me that the woman in a plain dress is not that strong!
In other words, it is very likely that he died after fighting with the woman in a plain dress.
If this is the case, then it is as he said. The woman in a plain dress is not that strong! "
The Holy Leader looked at Second Brother Dao. "You want to attack the woman in a plain dress first?"
Second Brother Dao nodded. "The best way to deal with these women is to kill them one by one!"
The Holy Leader frowned. "Kill them one by one?"
Second Brother Dao smiled. "If we gather the strength of my Dao Sect and your Holy Land, wouldn't it be much easier to kill one of them?"
The Holy Leader said softly, "That is possible!"
Dao Elder
Second Brother Dao said, "Then let's start with the weakest one. I have already sent someone to investigate the woman in a plain dress. If we find out where she is, we will deal with her first before killing the white-robed woman and Situ Tingyun!"
The Holy Leader glanced at Second Brother. "Don't forget about Ye Xuan. He is a genius and has mastered the nine Dao Scriptures. If he is given enough time …"
Second Brother Dao nodded. "Don't worry. I won't let him have it easy!"
As he spoke, he looked at the Holy Leader and smiled. "Do you know that Ye Xuan has a greatest weakness?"
The Holy Leader asked. "What weakness?"
Second Brother Dao smiled. "His younger sister, Ye Ling!"
The Holy Leader frowned. "His younger sister?"
Second Brother Dao nodded. "I have sent someone to Qingcheng to investigate. This person has a deep relationship with his younger sister, Ye Ling. It can be said that for Ye Ling, Ye Xuan will not hesitate to die!"
The Holy Leader narrowed his eyes. "You want to kill his younger sister!"
Second Brother Dao said, "I have already sent someone to look for Ye Ling. She has appeared in the Heavenly Oblivion Starfield. My people have already gone to the Heavenly Oblivion Starfield. They should be able to find her soon … If we can capture this person, even if we can't force Ye Xuan to die, we can force him to hand over all the Dao Scriptures."
The Holy Leader glanced at Second Brother. "I think you should investigate his younger sister. My intuition tells me that she is not a simple person!"
Second Brother Dao smiled. "Of course!
As a precaution, I have sent five Consolidation Realm experts!
Moreover, I have spoken to the Chi Tribe in the Heavenly Oblivion Starfield. They are willing to help and have sent six Consolidation Realm experts! "
The Holy Leader nodded slightly. "Then it should be foolproof!"
A moment later, Second Brother Dao left.
After the Second Dao Brother left, the Saint Master turned around and left. He came to a mountain, and in the depths of the mountain, there was a small bamboo house. In front of the bamboo house, there was a garden with all sorts of flowers. It was extremely beautiful.
Amidst the flowering shrubs, a woman was watering the flowers with a kettle.
The Holy Leader came to the side of the garden and bowed respectfully to the woman not far away. "Master!"
The woman put down the kettle. She gently sniffed a beautiful flower in front of her and then smiled. "Has the Taoist Faction started?"
The Holy Leader nodded. "Second Brother Dao wants to kill the woman in the plain dress and Sister Ye Xuan first!"
The woman stopped and turned to look at the Holy Leader. She blinked. "Kill the woman in the plain dress first?"
The Holy Leader nodded. "Yes, he speculated that the woman in the plain dress is the weakest!"
The woman suddenly shook her head and smiled.
The Holy Leader hesitated and then said, "Is that not the case?"
The woman gently plucked a flower and smiled. "Do you know who the woman in the plain dress is?"
The Holy Leader shook his head. "I don't!"
The woman looked up into the sky, and the smile on her face gradually vanished. "The woman in the plain dress is called Tian Ming. Over 100,000 years ago, she was already invincible in the world with her sword …. As for Ye Xuan's sister, the soul within her body is probably the soul of the Void Spirit Clan's Patriarch, Tian Xiu, from over 100,000 years ago. He was killed by Tian Ming all those years ago, but that man defied the heavens and changed his fate …. Even though she isn't at her peak right now, she isn't someone that just anyone can deal with."
As she spoke, she walked towards the small bamboo house in the distance. "The white robed woman that appeared earlier is called Butcher. She cultivates both the fist and the sword, and she's one of Tian Ming's clones. She's evenly matched against anyone with her 3 strikes of the sword!
As for Situ Tingyun, that little girl's growth is the fastest apart from that man …. Very few are a match for her with her 3 strikes of the sword!
Besides that, those women from the Netherworld …. "
When she spoke up to this point, she'd already walked over to the bamboo door. She pushed it open and smiled lightly. "If you want to kill Ye Xuan, you can't target the people behind him. Because every single one of them is stronger than the last, and they're strong to the point of despair!
If you want to kill him, you have to make use of the Disaster Cause he possesses!
So, you have to take it slow. "

Chapter 1447
Ye Xuan stood silently amidst a deathly silent expanse of the starry sky. At this moment, his right hand was like a piece of burning red iron, and it was an extremely shocking sight.
Absolute Sky Fen!
A Palm Incinerates the Heavens!
Ye Xuan's body gradually started to tremble, and the formidable energy caused his body to be slightly unable to support it!
After an unknown period of time, Ye Xuan suddenly opened his eyes, and then he suddenly slapped his palm forward!
As soon as his palm descended, the space before him started to be obliterated inch by inch, and it was extremely swift. In the blink of an eye, it had spread to a distance of 3km ….
In practically an instant, the starry sky around Ye Xuan had been completely obliterated!
On the other hand, Ye Xuan seemed as if he'd collapsed from exhaustion, and he almost collapsed to the ground.
Powerless!
At this moment, Ye Xuan felt as if all the strength in his body had been sucked out, and he was as weak as an old man. Moreover, his countenance was extremely pale.
Ye Xuan sat cross-legged in the starry sky for around an hour before his countenance gradually turned for the better, and his body slowly recovered as well!
After a long time, Ye Xuan took a deep breath and stood up. At this moment, his body was almost fully recovered.
Ye Xuan glanced at his right hand, grinned, and then turned around and left.
As soon as he returned to Dao City, Bai Dizi appeared before Ye Xuan.
Bai Dizi gazed at Ye Xuan. "Dark City's Zhao Yan is here again!"
Ye Xuan nodded. "I'll go see him!"
As soon as he finished speaking, he arrived at Sword Hall.
As soon as he arrived, Zhao Yan hurriedly stood up and cupped his fists. "Young Master Ye!"
Ye Xuan smiled. "Senior, you wouldn't be here to give me a gift again, right?"
Zhao Yan spoke in a low voice. "Young Master Ye, according to what we know, the Dao Faction might be targeting Young Master Ye's younger sister!"
Ye Xuan was astounded. "Targeting my younger sister?
Ye Ling? "
Zhao Yan nodded.
Young Master Ye, your sister Ye Ling once appeared in the Sky Oblivion Planet Zone, which is the territory of the Chi Clan. The Chi Clan has a close relationship with the Dao Sect. Your sister … "
Ye Xuan suddenly interrupted Zhao Yan's words, "Senior, are you saying that the Dao Gate is going to make a move against me?
Why? "
Zhao Yan looked at Ye Xuan, "Young master Ye, could it be that you don't know that the first Abyss Master of the Dark Abyss was one of the Four Saints of the Daoist Sect?"
Ye Xuan said solemnly, "I really don't know!"
At this moment, he realized that he knew too little about the powers outside!
Zhao Yan smiled bitterly and said, "I was negligent!
Young Master Ye, this Dark Abyss was created by Second Elder Dao, and Second Elder Dao is one of the Four Saints of the Dao Sect. The Dao Scriptures in Young Master Ye's hands also originate from this Dao Sect. "
Ye Xuan said softly, "I see!
In other words, this Gate has already started to target me? "
Zhao Yan nodded, "Yes!
Young Master Ye, your sister … "
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "If they want to look for my sister, then let them!"
Zhao Yan said in shock, "Young Master Ye, they have sent several Consolidation Realm experts, you …"
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "It's fine, let them go!"
Look for Ye Ling?
When he heard this news, he didn't panic at all, he even wanted to laugh!
What kind of existence was the senior in Ye Ling's body?
That was definitely not weaker than the White-robed Qing'Er!
Looking for Ling 'er, wasn't that the same as courting death?
Zhao Yan glanced at Ye Xuan, "Young Master Ye, aren't you worried?"
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "I'm not worried!
Let them look for her!
The more people go, the better! "
Zhao Yan's expression became a little strange.
At this time, Ye Xuan suddenly said, "Senior Zhao, I want to know about the forces outside. I wonder if Senior can help me with this!"
Zhao Yan smiled and said, "Of course!"
As if thinking of something, he said, "Young Master Ye, I wonder if you have any plans to break through to the Dao Realm?"
Ye Xuan blinked, "Can you help me?"
Zhao Yan smiled and said, "To be honest, I came here for this matter.
If Young Master Ye wants to break through to the Dao Realm, we can help Young Master Ye! "
Ye Xuan cupped his fists and said seriously, "Thank you!"
Right now, his greatest weakness was his realm!
His current realm was a little too low!
Zhao Yan looked outside, "Come in!"
As the voice fell, four old men walked into the hall, all four of them were at the peak of the Consolidation Realm!
Zhao Yan took out more than a hundred white jade bottles and placed them in front of Ye Xuan. Ye Xuan was a little puzzled, "These are?"
Zhao Yan said with a smile, "Medicinal pills!
These are my Profound City's top medicinal pills. In the outside world, any bottle can sell for at least several million Fortune Divine Crystals! "
Hearing this, Ye Xuan was dumbfounded.
A bottle can sell for several million Fortune Divine Crystals!
At this moment, he felt that poverty had limited his imagination!
He had many top-grade Fortune Ore veins that could produce tens of millions of Fortune Divine Crystals in a year. In his opinion, he, Ye Xuan, should be super rich!
But at this moment, he realized that he was still too poor in front of these ancient forces!
At this time, Zhao Yan said, "These medicinal pills can help people reach the Dao Realm. Every bottle contains extremely pure energy. Even if you want to buy them in the outside world, you basically can't buy them. Even if you sell them, they can be sold for sky-high prices!"
As he said this, he looked at Ye Xuan and said with a smile, "Young Master Ye, let's begin!"
Ye Xuan smiled bitterly, "I can't afford them!"
Zhao Yan was stunned, and then he smiled and said, "These medicinal pills are a gift from my Profound City to Young Master Ye!"
Ye Xuan was about to speak when Zhao Yan added, "The value of the scripture Young Master Ye gave me is far greater than these medicinal pills. Young Master Ye, there's no need to be courteous!
If you continue to be courteous, I wouldn't know what to do! "
Ye Xuan thought for a moment, and then he smiled, "Then I won't be unreasonable!"
Zhao Yan smiled, and then he passed a bottle of medicinal pills to Ye Xuan, "Young Master Ye, take this pill first!"
Ye Xuan nodded. He opened the jade bottle. There was an elixir the size of a thumb in the jade bottle. He poured the elixir into his mouth. As soon as the elixir entered his stomach, a wave of extremely pure energy spread from his body. At this moment, he felt warm all over and very comfortable.
At this moment, Zhao Yan suddenly said, "Young Master Ye, calm your Qi and focus. I'll help you break through to the Dao Control Realm later. During this period, Young Master Ye, please don't let your thoughts run wild!"
Ye Xuan nodded, and then he sat down cross-legged and calmed his Qi and focused.
He was currently at the Dao Control Realm, and if he reached the Dao Attainment Realm, he would be able to easily kill a Consolidation Realm expert without using the Insta-Kill Sword!
And if he used the Insta-Kill Sword …
Just thinking about it made him excited!
Just like that, Zhao Yan and the others began to help Ye Xuan break through to the Dao Attainment Realm!
...
In the Dao Tomb.
In a certain hall, the Lord looked at the scroll in his hand in silence.
The scroll in his hand contained the contents and annotations of the first seven scriptures, and it was very detailed!
As for the eighth and ninth scrolls, even Ye Xuan himself hadn't studied them, so no one knew the contents of the eighth and ninth scrolls.
Luo Hou suddenly said, "I never expected that he would really give them to us!"
The Lord looked at Luo Hou and smiled, "I feel like I'm dreaming as well!"
Qing Yaoyao smiled, "Actually, he doesn't care about the scriptures at all. It's us who care too much."
The Lord looked at Qing Yaoyao and smiled, "Indeed. Fortunately, we chose to stand on his side. Otherwise, the Dao Tomb would have probably vanished completely by now!"
Everyone fell silent.
With the white-robed woman's strength, she could probably destroy the Dao Tomb with just a sneeze!
Meanwhile, Bitter King suddenly said, "Don't we still have the eighth and ninth scrolls?"
Everyone looked at Bitter King. Bitter King was slightly puzzled, "What's wrong?"
The Lord smiled, "We can't be too greedy!
Even if he gives us the eighth and ninth scrolls, we wouldn't dare to take them. Because giving them to us is equivalent to asking us to die. Understand? "
Bitter King frowned, "Why?"
Chi Yaoyao suddenly said, "Because many powers are coveting these scriptures in secret!
The contents of these seven scrolls are enough for us to use for a few hundred years!
As for the later ones, even though we want to read them as well, we'll be killed the moment we read them.
Those powers don't dare to bully Ye Xuan now, but that doesn't mean they won't dare to bully us!
Understand? "
Bitter King was speechless.
Chi Yaoyao continued, "Seven scriptures are more than enough for us!
Any more and it won't be a blessing but a curse! "
The Lord nodded, "Yes!"
As he spoke, he stood up and smiled, "We've already earned a lot!
We should keep a low profile and develop ourselves. As for Young Master Ye, we can't help him even if we want to!
However, he doesn't need our help!
So, I hereby announce that all the disciples of the Dao Tomb outside are to return. "
Bitter King frowned, "All of you?"
The Lord smiled, "Yes!
You're not allowed to leave for a hundred years! "
As he spoke, he walked to the door and looked at the sky, "The world is about to change!
And we are too weak!
Developing ourselves is the way to go!
In a hundred years, the Dao Tomb will become a great power in the world. Of course, we have to survive!
Haha … "
....
Ancient God Abyss.
Su Zhe had also obtained the contents and annotations of the first to seventh Dao Scriptures from Ye Xuan!
Somewhere at the top of a pyramid, the white-haired elder in front of Su Zhe suddenly said, "Let all of us in the Fifth Dimension come back!"
Su Zhe hesitated, then said, "Master, what do you mean?"
The white-haired elder said softly, "Young Master Ye's matter is no longer something we can participate in!
Obtaining these seven Dao Scriptures is already a great blessing!
If we continue to get involved, we might have a greater opportunity, but it's also possible that we'll be doomed forever! "
Su Zhe nodded, "I understand."
The white-haired elder turned to look in the direction of the Fifth Dimension and said softly, "From today onwards, no one is allowed to leave the Ancient God Abyss!"
Su Zhe said in a low voice, "Master, the eighth and ninth Dao Scriptures …"
The white-haired elder glanced at Su Zhe, "Being too greedy will kill you!"
As he finished speaking, he turned and left.
...
Sky Oblivion Galaxy.
A woman was shuttling through the starry sky, emitting a faint glow around her!
Ye Ling!
Ye Ling's face was expressionless, her expression cold.
At this moment, behind her, a dozen powerful auras were closing in at an extremely fast speed.
Ye Ling stopped and turned to look. At this moment, twelve people appeared in front of her.
All of them were at the peak of the Consolidation Realm!
The elder who led the group looked at Ye Ling, "Miss Ye Ling, we would like to invite you to be a guest of the Dao Sect. Will you come with us, or should we 'invite' you?"
Ye Ling suddenly slapped out.
Boom!
The head of the elder who spoke flew into the air.
The rest of the people were stunned.
Ye Ling looked at the remaining people and slapped out again.
Boom!
One of the Consolidation Realm experts was directly turned into nothingness!
Seeing this scene, the rest of the people's expressions changed drastically!
Ye Ling walked towards the remaining people, her expression cold, "Bullying his sister again!
What does what he does have to do with his sister? "
Everyone: "…"
At this moment, Ye Ling suddenly said coldly, "I'm asking you a question!"
As she said this, she slapped out again.
Boom!
In the distance, another expert of the Consolidation Realm died on the spot …
...
fpzw







Chapter 1448
In the starry sky, the remaining Consolidation Realm experts were shocked to the extreme at this moment!
How could Ye Xuan's sister be so strong?
Didn't they say that his sister was just average?
In the distance, Ye Ling slowly walked toward the Consolidation Realm experts, her expression cold. "Every day, you threaten him with his sister. Is that all you can do?"
One of the old men walked out and said with a trembling voice, "Sir, you …"
Ye Ling suddenly lashed out with another slap.
Boom!
The space where the old man was directly exploded, and the old man himself instantly turned into nothingness.
The remaining people looked at Ye Ling as if she was looking at a devil!
Since when did the Consolidation Realm experts become so weak?
Just one slap?
At this moment, the hearts of the remaining people were filled with fear!
What had they done?
How could such a devil come!
Was this the legendary "courting death"?
At this moment, Ye Ling suddenly blasted out a punch, and a glowing fist mark flashed out.
Boom!
The space in front of Ye Xuan was directly erased, along with the Consolidation Realm experts!
All the Consolidation Realm experts were instantly killed at this moment!
Ye Ling clapped her hands, turned around, and left.
At this moment, a voice sounded in Ye Ling's mind. "Master … I want to see my brother!"
The person who spoke was naturally the real Ye Ling.
Ye Ling continued to walk into the distance. "If you go back now, you will become his burden!"
Ye Ling fell silent.
Ye Ling said again, "Cultivate well with me, and you will be able to help him in the future, understand?"
After a while, Ye Ling said softly, "Understood!"
After a while, Ye Ling disappeared into the vast starry sky in the distance.
....
In an ancient city in the Heavenly Oblivion Starfield, an old man suddenly appeared on the city wall. He looked at the end of the distant starry sky, his eyes full of disbelief.
This person was the patriarch of the Tian Family in the Heavenly Oblivion Starfield, Chi Lin!
Just now, all the experts in the Heavenly Oblivion Starfield were killed!
Six Consolidation Realm experts had all fallen at the same time!
Ye Ling!
After a moment of silence, Chi Lin said softly, "Didn't they say that his sister is very weak?"
...
Dao Sect.
In a certain pavilion, the Second Elder Dao suddenly opened his eyes and frowned.
All the experts he had sent were gone!
After a long silence, the Second Brother said softly, "What a good Ye Xuan, what a good Ye Ling … I underestimated you!"
With that, he got up and left.
Outside the pavilion, there was a stretch of green mountains surrounded by flying cranes.
The Second Dao Brother looked into the distance with a hint of doubt in his eyes. "What kind of force is behind you …"
According to his investigation, there was a soul inside Ye Ling's body, but he never expected it to be so strong!
At the beginning, he thought that only the woman in a plain dress and a few others were behind Ye Xuan, but now he realized that it wasn't just them.
He was very puzzled.
What kind of force was behind Ye Xuan?
Could there really be a force stronger than the Dao Sect in this world?
Daoism!
At present, the Dao Sect was the number one force in the Myriad Worlds because the Dao Scripture originated from there.
If there were no other forces, it wouldn't have any impact on the Myriad Worlds. However, if there were no Dao Sect, the martial arts civilization of the Myriad Worlds would lag at least a million years behind!
Although the Dao Sect became weaker with the departure of the owner of the Dao Scripture, it was still not something that other forces could compare to!
Now, the force behind Ye Xuan made him feel pressured!
What kind of force was it?
At this moment, an old man suddenly appeared behind him. The old man bowed respectfully and said, "I've found it.
Green City, Ye Clan, ancestral temple.
"Ancestors, Ye Xuan has no talent and no virtue … From now on, Ye Xuan's position as the Crown Prince will be replaced by Ye Lang."
The one who spoke was an old man in a black robe.
Not far behind the old man stood a young man with a faint smile on his face.
This person was Ye Lang.
On both sides were the elders of the Ye Clan.
"Why?!"
At this moment, a timid voice suddenly rang out in the ancestral temple.
Everyone turned to look and saw a little girl standing at the door. She was about 12 or 13 years old, and her hands were tightly gripping the hem of her skirt. Her face had a sickly pallor, and she looked a little weak. There was even a trace of fear in her eyes.
This little girl was called Ye Ling, Ye Xuan's younger sister. When she heard that the Clan wanted to remove Ye Xuan, she rushed over despite her illness.
The black-robed old man frowned, "Ye Ling, what are you doing!"
The little girl called Ye Ling bowed to the people in the ancestral temple and said timidly, "Great Elder, my brother Ye Xuan is the Crown Prince. Why did you cripple him for no reason?"
The Great Elder looked coldly at Ye Ling, "This is a matter of the Clan. What are you interrupting for?
Leave! "
Ye Ling was clearly a little fearful. She did not dare to look the Great Elder in the eye, but she did not leave. Instead, she mustered up her courage and walked into the ancestral hall. She bowed to the elders on both sides of the hall and said, "Elders, my brother is currently fighting with the Li family for the mining rights of the mine in Nanshan. He is now fighting for the family, and it is unknown whether he is alive or dead. However, the family has used a groundless excuse to remove his position as the Crown Prince. This is truly unfair.
"Impudent!"
The Great Elder suddenly raged, "Whether he's stripped or not, it's not up to a little girl like you to decide.
Men, drag her away! "
At this time, the new Crown Prince, Ye Lang, suddenly laughed, "You should be flogged 30 times as a warning to others!"
The Great Elder coldly replied, "Then flog him 30 times!"
Very quickly, two Ye Clan guards rushed in.
Ye Ling clenched her fists and said angrily, "This is unfair! My brother has risked his life for the Clan for so many years. Even now, he's fighting for the Clan. The Clan is unfair to him …"
One of the guards glanced at the new Crown Prince, Ye Lang. He knew that his chance to shine had come.
The guard sneered, "Young Master Ye Lang inherits the Crown Prince's position. What are you yelling about?" As he spoke, he raised his hand and slapped Ye Ling's face.
Slap!
A crisp slap sounded. Ye Ling's right cheek instantly turned red and swollen. However, she didn't cry. She just clutched her cheek tightly.
Ye Lang looked at the guard and smiled, "What's your name?"
The guard hurriedly bowed, "This subordinate, Zhang Mu, greets the Crown Prince."
Ye Lang nodded, "You're not bad. After I become the Crown Prince, I'll need ten Personal Guards. From now on, you'll be my Personal Guard."
Hearing this, Zhang Mu was overjoyed. He hurriedly bowed deeply, "This subordinate is willing to go through fire and water for the Crown Prince!"
Ye Lang nodded, "Drag him away. This person is causing trouble in the Ancestral Hall. Do not hold back. Understood?"
Zhang Mu glanced at Ye Lang. When he saw the killing intent in Ye Lang's eyes, he understood.
He immediately grabbed Ye Ling's hair and dragged her out.
At this time, Zhang Mu seemed to have seen something and stopped.
Within the Ancestral Hall, everyone turned their heads to look outside.
Not far from the Ancestral Hall, a young man was walking towards the Ancestral Hall. He was wearing a tight-fitting robe that was tattered and covered in blood.
This person was Ye Xuan, who had rushed back from the Nanshan!
Seeing Ye Xuan, Ye Lang's lips curled into a cold smile.
Within the Ancestral Hall, all the Elders were frowning.
The Great Elder squinted his eyes, his face dark and gloomy. No one knew what he was thinking.
From afar, when Ye Xuan saw Zhang Mu dragging Ye Ling, his face turned savage. "Who gave you the guts to touch my sister?"
When Zhang Mu saw Ye Xuan, his face changed. He quickly looked at Ye Lang and was about to speak. At this time, Ye Xuan was like a ferocious tiger leaping in front of him. Before the latter could react, Ye Xuan's fist landed on his face.
Peng!
Zhang Mu felt his head spin, and he stumbled and fell.
Ye Lang did not stop there. He charged towards Zhang Mu again. At this time, Ye Lang suddenly roared, "Ye Xuan, he's my man. How dare you …"
Ye Xuan suddenly stepped on Zhang Mu's chest.
Pu!
Zhang Mu spat out a mouthful of blood.
Seeing this, Ye Lang's face turned ugly. Ye Xuan lifted his head to look at him, asking savagely, "Your man?"
As he spoke, he stomped on Zhang Mu's face.
Zhang Mu's face turned into a bloody mess, as he screamed, "Prince, save, save me …"
Ye Xuan did not care about Zhang Mu, as he walked to Ye Ling's side. Seeing Ye Ling's state, Ye Xuan felt as though his heart was being cut by a knife. He clenched his fists, and his entire body trembled.
When Ye Ling saw Ye Xuan, her tears flowed, "Brother, it hurts, it hurts …"
Hearing this, Ye Xuan's expression turned savage. In the next instant, he charged in front of Zhang Mu and kicked Zhang Mu's head.
Peng!
Qingcheng, Ye Clan, Ancestral Hall.
"Ancestors, Ye Xuan has no talent, no virtue … From now on, Ye Xuan's position as Prince shall be replaced by Ye Lang."
The one who spoke was an old man in black robes.
Not far behind the old man, there was a youth with a faint smile on his face.
This person was Ye Lang.
On both sides, there were the Elders of the Ye Clan.
"Why!?"
Right at this moment, a slightly timid voice suddenly resounded within the ancestral hall.
Everyone turned to look and saw a little girl standing at the door. She was about 12 or 13 years old, and her hands were tightly gripping the hem of her skirt. Her face had a sickly pallor, and she looked a little weak. There was even a trace of fear in her eyes.
This girl was called Ye Ling, and she was Ye Xuan's younger sister. When she heard that Ye Xuan was to be replaced, she disregarded her illness and rushed over.
The black-robed old man frowned, "Ye Ling, what are you doing!?"
The little girl called Ye Ling bowed to everyone in the hall, as she asked timidly, "Great Elder, my brother, Ye Xuan, is the Prince. Why did you cripple him for no reason?"
The Great Elder looked at Ye Ling coldly, "This is a matter of the clan, what are you interrupting for?
Leave! "
Ye Ling was obviously afraid, not daring to look at the Great Elder, but she did not leave. Instead, she plucked up her courage and walked into the hall. Once again, she bowed to the Elders, "Dear Elders, my brother is fighting with the Li Clan over the mining rights at Nanshan. He is fighting for the clan, and it is unknown whether he is dead or alive. Yet, the clan is using a groundless excuse to strip him of his position. This is really unfair."
"Impudent!"
The Great Elder suddenly raged, "Whether or not he is crippled, it is not up to a little girl like you to decide.
Men, drag her away! "
At this time, the new Prince, Ye Lang, suddenly laughed, "You should be flogged 30 times as a warning to others!"
The Great Elder replied coldly, "Then flog him 30 times!"
Very quickly, two Ye Clan guards rushed in.
Ye Ling clenched her fists, and said angrily, "This is unfair! My brother has risked his life for the clan for so many years, and even now, he is fighting for the clan. The clan is unfair to him …"
One of the guards glanced at the new Prince, Ye Lang. He knew that this was his chance to shine.
The guard sneered, "Young Master Ye Lang inherits the position of Prince. What are you yelling about?" As he spoke, he raised his hand and slapped Ye Ling's face.
Slap!
A crisp slap sounded, and the right side of Ye Ling's face instantly swelled up. However, she did not cry, and only held her cheek tightly.
Ye Lang looked at the guard and smiled, "What's your name?"
The guard hurriedly bowed, "This subordinate, Zhang Mu, greets the Prince."
Ye Lang nodded, "You are very good. After I become the Prince, I will need ten guards. From now on, you will be my guard."
Hearing this, Zhang Mu was overjoyed, and hurriedly bowed deeply, "This subordinate is willing to go through fire and water for the Prince, even if it means death!"
Ye Lang nodded slightly, "Drag him away. This person is disturbing the ancestral hall, do not show mercy, understand?"
Zhang Mu glanced at Ye Lang, and when he saw the murderous intent in Ye Lang's eyes, he understood.
He immediately grabbed Ye Ling's hair and dragged her out.
At this moment, Zhang Mu did not know what he saw, but he suddenly stopped.
In the ancestral hall, everyone turned their heads to look outside.
Not far from the ancestral hall, a young man was walking towards the ancestral hall. The young man was wearing a tight-fitting robe, and the robe was tattered, and there was blood everywhere.
The young man was Ye Xuan, who had rushed back from Nanshan!
Seeing Ye Xuan, Ye Lang's mouth curled into a cold smile.
In the ancestral hall, the Elders frowned.
The Great Elder narrowed his eyes, and his expression was frighteningly gloomy. No one knew what he was thinking.
From afar, when Ye Xuan saw Zhang Mu dragging Ye Ling, his expression turned savage, "Who gave you the guts to touch my sister?"
When Zhang Mu saw Ye Xuan, his expression changed. He quickly looked at Ye Lang, and was about to speak, when Ye Xuan suddenly leaped in front of him like a ferocious tiger. Before the latter could react, Ye Xuan's fist landed on his face.
Peng!
Zhang Mu's head spun, and he stumbled and fell.
Ye Lang did not stop there, and he rushed towards Zhang Mu again. At this time, Ye Lang suddenly roared, "Ye Xuan, he's my man, how dare you …"
Ye Xuan suddenly stepped on Zhang Mu's chest.
Pu!
Zhang Mu spat out a mouthful of blood.
Seeing this, Ye Lang's expression turned ugly, while Ye Xuan lifted his head to look at him, asking savagely, "Your man?"
As he spoke, he stomped on Zhang Mu's face.
Zhang Mu's face turned into a bloody mess, as he screamed, "Prince, save, save me …"
Ye Xuan did not care about Zhang Mu, as he walked to Ye Ling's side. Seeing Ye Ling's appearance, Ye Xuan felt as though his heart was being sliced by a knife. He clenched his fists, and his entire body trembled.
When Ye Ling saw Ye Xuan, her tears flowed, "Brother, it hurts, it hurts …"
Hearing this, Ye Xuan's expression turned savage. In the next instant, he charged in front of Zhang Mu and kicked Zhang Mu's head.
Peng!







Chapter 1449
Outside the bamboo house, Holy Lord's heart skipped a beat.
He didn't know how strong the plain-dressed woman was, but he knew the strength of the woman in the bamboo house.
In any case, he didn't have the confidence to take a single blow from the woman in the bamboo house!
However, he didn't expect that the woman in the bamboo house was so afraid of the plain-dressed woman!
Who was the plain-dressed woman?
How could she make the woman in the bamboo house so afraid!
Holy Lord was very curious!
At this time, the woman in the bamboo house suddenly said, "What are you waiting for?"
Holy Lord came back to his senses and quickly bowed respectfully, "I will send someone to stop the Taoism experts!"
Saying this, he turned around and left.
At this time, the woman's voice sounded again, "You go personally!"
Holy Lord was startled, then he nodded, "Yes!"
Saying this, he disappeared into the distance.
Inside the bamboo house, the woman poured herself a cup of tea. She took a sip and said softly, "The Cause of Calamity …"
...
Xuan City.
When Ye Xuan followed Zhao Yan and the others to Xuan City, Ye Xuan was stunned by the city in front of him.
The entire city stretched across the starry sky like a giant beast, causing people to involuntarily feel a sense of insignificance.
Ye Xuan chuckled, "Impressive!"
Zhao Yan grinned. "My Darkstar City has existed for 160,000 years. During these 160,000 years, we've experienced many things. However, we still exist!"
Proud!
One had to admit that Xuan City was qualified!
At present, even Dao City and Boundless Holy Land didn't dare to provoke Xuan City. Of course, Xuan City didn't dare to provoke these two forces!
Both sides had deep foundations. Once a war broke out, both sides would suffer!
Zhao Yan led Ye Xuan into the city. As soon as they entered the city, Ye Xuan felt countless powerful auras!
Ye Xuan's expression gradually became solemn.
One had to admit that Xuan City was indeed powerful. Although the Fifth Dimension had absorbed so many experts from the Whirling World, there was still a big gap between them and Xuan City.
After all, most of the Whirling World's experts had been killed by the white-robed Qing 'er.
Zhao Yan brought Ye Xuan to a large hall. He bowed slightly towards the hall, then looked at Ye Xuan, "Young master Ye, the City Lord requests your presence!"
Ye Xuan nodded and walked into the hall. The hall was empty except for a woman.
The woman wore a long purple dress, and her long hair draped over her shoulders. At this moment, she was looking at him with a smile.
It was a woman!
Ye Xuan was a little surprised. He never thought that the City Lord of Xuan City would be a woman!
The woman smiled and said, "Young master Ye seems to be a little surprised!"
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "Indeed!"
The woman shook her head and smiled. She slowly walked in front of Ye Xuan and sized up Ye Xuan, then said, "Young master Ye's dao body has already reached the Dao Controlling Realm. Moreover, it was because he devoured the blood of the Naga Dragons that he reached the Dao Controlling Realm, right?"
Ye Xuan nodded, "That's right!"
The woman looked at Ye Xuan, "Young master Ye saved the Naga Dragons!"
Ye Xuan shook his head, "He only brought one of the Naga Dragons out!"
The woman was silent.
Ye Xuan asked, "What's the matter?"
The woman shook her head and smiled, "Young master Ye, do you know who imprisoned the Naga Dragons?"
Ye Xuan shook his head, "I don't know!"
The woman had a complicated expression, "To be honest, I'm afraid that only Young master Ye can bear such a huge karma."
Ye Xuan said in a deep voice, "Miss, what do you know?"
The woman nodded and said with a smile, "The one who imprisoned the Naga Dragons was the Martial Emperor of the Ultimate Martial Realm. This person was almost invincible back then." Ye Xuan hesitated, "Is he still alive?"
The woman smiled and said, "Yes!
He's still alive! "
Ye Xuan was speechless.
The woman smiled slightly, "Let's not talk about the grudge between the Martial Emperor and the Naga Dragons!
Let's talk about your dao body! "
Ye Xuan suddenly said, "How should I address you, senior?"
Senior!
The woman glanced at Ye Xuan. Up until now, she had a good impression of Ye Xuan.
Ye Xuan was neither servile nor overbearing, and he didn't have the slightest arrogance.
If Ye Xuan was overbearing because of the woman in the plain dress, then such a person wasn't worthy of Xuan City's goodwill!
The woman collected her thoughts and said with a smile, "You can be called Lan Ruo!"
Ye Xuan said, "Senior Lan Ruo!"
The woman glanced at Ye Xuan, "Miss is good!
The word 'senior' is too old! "
Ye Xuan smiled, "Alright, Miss Lan Ruo!"
Lan Ruo smiled and said, "Let's talk about your dao body. If you want to improve your dao body further, you will need the help of external objects. Otherwise, you can only slowly stabilize your physical body over time. However, if that's the case, you won't be able to break through for at least a few hundred years!"
Ye Xuan nodded, "I know!
Therefore, I'm here to ask for help from Miss Lan Ruo! "
Lan Ruo smiled and said, "You've really found the right person!
For now, besides the dao sects, the only one who can help you improve is my Xuan City! "
Ye Xuan looked at Lan Ruo, "Miss Lan Ruo, according to what I know, the dao sects have already started to target me. Isn't Xuan City afraid of the dao sects for helping me?"
Lan Ruo smiled and said, "We're not afraid, but we really don't want to be enemies with the dao sects."
As she said that, she glanced at Ye Xuan and smiled. "I'll also be honest with Young Master Ye. If you fight with the dao sects, we won't send anyone to help you. That's because the price we'll have to pay if we start a war with the dao sects!
However, in private, if we can help Young Master Ye, as long as it's within our capabilities, we'll do our best. "
Ye Xuan looked straight at Lan Ruo, "Just because of Qing 'er?"
Lan Ruo shook her head. "Not just because of that senior, but also because of Young Master Ye!"
Ye Xuan was a little surprised, "Me?"
Lan Ruo smiled and said, "Before we met Young Master Ye, we just wanted to express our goodwill to you and form a good relationship with you. However, after meeting Young Master Ye, Young Master Ye's actions made me have a good impression of you. I think you're a good person, so we can get to know each other better!"
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "Because of those Dao scriptures?"
Lan Ruo chuckled and said, "You can say that!"
Ye Xuan fell silent.
Actually, he knew very well that the reason why the other party was so friendly was mainly because of Qing 'er!
Without Qing 'er, no matter how good Ye Xuan was, Xuan City wouldn't offend the dao sects for him!
At the thought of this, Ye Xuan smiled and said, "If Miss Lan Ruo needs any help in the future, feel free to let me know. I'll do my best to help as long as it's within my capabilities!"
Lan Ruo looked at Ye Xuan and smiled. "Really?"
Ye Xuan nodded.
Lan Ruo smiled and said, "I'd like to thank Young Master Ye in advance!"
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "Miss Lan Ruo, you're too polite!
I might only be able to help Miss Lan Ruo in the future, but Miss Lan Ruo can help me now. I'm taking advantage of you! "
Lan Ruo shook her head and said, "Young Master Ye, you're a Swordsman and a straightforward person. I'll be frank with you. If we can get that senior to give us a few pointers, the value of that would be worth more than ten Xuan Cities."
As she said that, she looked at Ye Xuan and said, "If there's a chance in the future, I'd like to ask Young Master Ye to recommend me. Lan Ruo will be eternally grateful!"
Ye Xuan nodded and said, "If I see Qing 'er, I'll definitely recommend you!"
Lan Ruo smiled and said, "Thank you!"
As she said that, she looked outside and said, "Young Master, please follow me!"
After that, she walked out of the hall.
Ye Xuan followed behind her.
Lan Ruo brought Ye Xuan to an underground palace. The underground palace was eerie and the wind was bone-chilling.
Ye Xuan looked around and asked, "This is?"
Lan Ruo smiled and said, "A forbidden area of Xuan City!"
Ye Xuan nodded and continued to follow Lan Ruo. After a while, Lan Ruo brought Ye Xuan to an altar. A huge beast was lying on the altar!
The huge beast was shaped like a dragon and had four horns and six tails. Its entire body was covered in thick, pitch-black scales.
Ye Xuan was puzzled and asked, "What is this?"
Lan Ruo said softly, "An exotic beast, Winged Dragon!"
Ye Xuan looked at Lan Ruo and asked, "The Dragon Race?"
Lan Ruo smiled and said, "You can say that!
However, it's different from the Naga Dragons!
The Dragon Race actually has many, many branches, such as the Naga Dragons, Winged Dragons, Ancient Dragons, True Dragons … After all, dragons are lascivious by nature and like to sow seeds everywhere. Therefore, the entire Dragon Race has many species! "
Ye Xuan was speechless.
The reason why the Dragon Race had so many branches was because they were lascivious by nature …
As if he had thought of something, Ye Xuan asked, "Then, among the Dragon Race, which is the strongest?"
Lan Ruo thought for a while and said, "It should be the Ancestral Dragon, the ancestor of all dragons. However, this dragon completely disappeared hundreds of thousands of years ago!"
As she said that, she looked at Ye Xuan and smiled. "If you can devour some of the Ancestral Dragon's blood, your physical body should be able to easily reach the Consolidation Realm. In fact, it might even be possible for you to go beyond that!
Unfortunately, the Ancestral Dragon's blood is extremely precious. Only the Dao Sects might have some of it. After all, the Ancestral Dragon followed that senior back then! "
Ye Xuan asked, "The Dao Scripture's owner?"
Lan Ruo nodded. "The Ancestral Dragon was his mount back then!
Therefore, the Dao Sects might have its blood. However, the Dao Sects will definitely not give it to Young Master Ye! "
Ye Xuan smiled and looked at Winged Dragon in the distance. "Is this Winged Dragon alive or …?"
Lan Ruo said softly, "It's dead!
It was killed by my ancestor back then! "
Ye Xuan nodded. "Understood!"
Lan Ruo looked at Winged Dragon. "This dragon's blood is still here. Young Master Ye can devour its blood later."
As she said that, she opened her palm and hundreds of white jade bottles appeared in front of Ye Xuan. "These are all supreme-grade pills that can strengthen one's physical body. After Young Master Ye devours its blood later, you can use these pills. That way, your chances of success will be much higher!"
Ye Xuan cupped his fists. "Thank you!"
With that, he put away the pills and walked up to Winged Dragon.
Just as he was about to make a move, Lan Ruo suddenly said, "Young Master Ye."
Ye Xuan turned to look at Lan Ruo. Lan Ruo looked at Ye Xuan. "Among the many types of dragons, Winged Dragon is one of the most lascivious. Its blood is extremely Yang and tyrannical. If you devour its blood, you might not be able to suppress the lascivious nature in its blood!"
Ye Xuan smiled. "Don't worry, Miss Lan Ruo. This bloodline of mine will definitely be able to suppress that lascivious nature."
Lan Ruo nodded. "Then Young Master Ye, let's begin!"
She had some understanding of Ye Xuan's blood. If he could even devour the blood of the Nagas, then Winged Dragon's blood shouldn't be a problem!
On the altar, Ye Xuan swiped his right hand and Winged Dragon's corpse split open. The next moment, a stream of fresh blood spurted out.
Ye Xuan gently guided with his palm, and the blood directly entered his body.
Boom!
As soon as Winged Dragon's blood entered his body, Ye Xuan's eyes widened. His entire body felt unbearably hot!
Ye Xuan hurriedly activated the power of his bloodline. However, the moment he activated it, he discovered that his body had become even hotter!
What's going on?
Ye Xuan was stunned.
His body was getting hotter and hotter, and a certain part of his body was reacting strongly. Ye Xuan hurriedly tried to suppress it again. However, when he activated the power of his bloodline again, he discovered that his body was reacting even more strongly!
Ye Xuan was horrified. Holy shit, what the hell is this?
In the distance, Lan Ruo looked at the red Ye Xuan and frowned. She said softly, "Could it be that your bloodline is lascivious in nature as well?"
Ye Xuan, "…"
.....







Chapter 1450
On the altar, Ye Xuan's face was as red as burning iron!
Apart from that, all the blood in his body started to boil!
Ye Xuan's expression was extremely ugly!
This was because he realized that his blood could not suppress the Blood of Rainbringer at all!
On the contrary, it seemed to be taking the side of the evildoer.
Ye Xuan slowly closed his eyes. He began to calm down and concentrate.
To suppress the Blood of Rainbringer and the Demonic Madness Bloodline!
If he were to be controlled by his own bloodline while he was awake, wouldn't that be too useless?
In the distance, Lan Ruo did not leave either.
Although Ye Xuan was not in a good state, the current Ye Xuan was not a threat to her.
She was the City Lord of Mystic City, one of the strongest in the world.
Even if the Second Brother was here, he might not be able to do anything to her, let alone Ye Xuan!
Lan Ruo just watched. On the altar in the distance, Ye Xuan's expression gradually began to contort. It was obvious that Ye Xuan was in great pain.
If it was just the Blood of Rainbringer, it would be a piece of cake for him.
The problem was that his own bloodline was also causing trouble!
What he really wanted to suppress was actually his own bloodline!
He realized that this bloodline was a little beastly!
Just like that, time passed bit by bit …
Unknowingly, Zhao Yan appeared behind Lan Ruo. Zhao Yan bowed slightly and said respectfully, "City Lord, the Dao Sect has sent six Consolidation Realm experts to hunt down that senior!"
Lan Ruo turned to look at Zhao Yan. "Are you sure?"
Zhao Yan nodded. "Absolutely!"
Lan Ruo said softly, "What is the Second Brother trying to do … I don't really understand!"
Zhao Yan said solemnly, "Perhaps they think that the senior is very weak!"
Lan Ruo asked, "Why?"
Zhao Yan hesitated for a moment before saying, "When I was investigating Young Master Ye, I found out that the Tendo of the Fifth Dimension, Mu Niannian, had told Young Master Ye that she and the plain-dressed woman were evenly matched. Moreover, she had said this more than once!"
Lan Ruo blinked. "She really said that?"
Zhao Yan nodded.
Lan Ruo said softly, "This Fifth Dimension Tendo … She has really caused great harm to the Dao Sect!"
Zhao Yan spoke in a low voice, "That senior is about to enter the Beast Realm!"
Lan Ruo frowned. "Beast Realm?"
Zhao Yan nodded, "Yes."
There was a hint of doubt in Lan Ruo's eyes. "Could it be that she wants to go to the Beast Realm?
Or could it be that she's just passing through the Beast Realm? "
Zhao Yan said solemnly: "City Lord, this Beast Realm …"
Lan Ruo said softly, "You shouldn't be worried about her, but the Beast Realm!"
Zhao Yan: "…"
Lan Ruo asked again, "What about the Boundless Sacred Ground?"
Zhao Yan shook his head, "The people we planted in the Boundless Sacred Land are all dead!"
Lan Ruo said softly, "This place is even more mysterious than Daoism!"
Zhao Yan nodded, "Now I don't dare to send people to the Boundless Sacred Land, because once they go there, they will disappear without a trace."
After a moment of silence, Lan Ruo said, "Forget about them!
Continue to pay attention to the Dao Sect's movements and report to me at any time! "
Zhao Yan bowed slightly. "Yes!"
After saying that, he turned and left.
Lan Ruo turned to look at Ye Xuan on the altar in the distance and said softly, "Second Brother Dao … Young Master Ye is lucky to have an opponent like you!"
...
After an unknown period of time, Ye Xuan's expression gradually calmed down!
He had forcefully suppressed the power of his bloodline!
When he was in a frenzied state, he couldn't do anything to the power of his bloodline. However, when he was sober, he could still suppress the power of his bloodline.
At this moment, Lan Ruo walked in front of Ye Xuan. She took a look at Ye Xuan and said, "Can you continue to absorb the blood of the Winged Dragon?" Ye Xuan nodded. "Yes!"
Lan Ruo nodded slightly. "Then let's continue!
I will protect you. "
Ye Xuan said, "Thank you!"
As he spoke, he started to continue absorbing the blood of the Winged Dragon. At the same time, he started to consume the medicinal pills.
As more and more of the blood of the Winged Dragon was absorbed by Ye Xuan, his body started to tremble while strands of powerful aura emanated from within him. His body started to gradually change.
Lan Ruo gazed at Ye Xuan with a calm expression, but she was slightly shocked in her heart.
She wasn't shocked by Ye Xuan's Dao Physique, it was Ye Xuan's bloodline!
Because after the blood of the Winged Dragon entered Ye Xuan's body, it didn't affect Ye Xuan's bloodline at all!
There had been people in Dark City who had tried to absorb the blood of the Winged Dragon, but all of them had failed!
Because the blood of the Winged Dragon was truly too powerful!
The bloodline of humans couldn't endure the impact of the blood of the Winged Dragon at all!
However, the blood of the Winged Dragon hadn't affected Ye Xuan's bloodline at all. In other words, the power of Ye Xuan's bloodline was far superior to the blood of the Winged Dragon.
Exactly what sort of bloodline is this?
Lan Ruo's heart was filled with curiosity!
Right at this moment, Ye Xuan's body started to tremble!
Inside his body, there was a violent force that was attacking his body!
When she saw this, Lan Ruo suddenly placed her right hand lightly on top of Ye Xuan's head.
Boom!
A powerful aura enveloped Ye Xuan!
In an instant, the violent force within Ye Xuan's body was suppressed!
Lan Ruo said in a low voice, "Your Dao Physique is about to break through. Don't get distracted. The force within your body is the power of the Winged Dragon's bloodline. It's useless to you. Guide it slowly and then disperse it out of your body!"
Ye Xuan nodded, and he started to slowly draw the blood of the Winged Dragon out of his body!
Just like that, Ye Xuan's body gradually calmed down after around two days.
Meanwhile, Lan Ruo retreated to the side and glanced at the corpse of the Winged Dragon. At this moment, the blood of the Winged Dragon had been completely absorbed by Ye Xuan!
When she thought of this, she couldn't help but shake her head and laugh bitterly.
The blood of the Winged Dragon was a supreme-grade ingredient for refining elixirs!
Its value was unimaginable.
But now, Ye Xuan had benefited from it just like that!
But fortunately, it was worth it!
Based on her investigations, Ye Xuan wasn't someone who didn't know how to be grateful. Today, Xuan City had helped Ye Xuan and sowed good karma. Although there was no guarantee that there would be good results, she was willing to give it a try.
Apart from the plain-dressed lady, Ye Xuan was also partially willing.
After meeting Ye Xuan, she realized that Ye Xuan was even more of a monster than they had imagined.
Given time, Ye Xuan's achievements would definitely not be low.
Investing in such a monster would definitely be beneficial to Xuan City in the future.
At this moment, Ye Xuan suddenly opened his eyes and stood up. The moment he stood up, the space around him shook violently and cracked!
Ye Xuan was stunned.
At this moment, Lan Ruo suddenly smiled and said, "Congratulations, your Daoist Physique has reached the Dao Defense Realm!"
Dao Defense Realm!
Ye Xuan slowly clenched his right hand, and a powerful force gathered in his hand. This force was at least five times stronger than before!
As if thinking of something, Ye Xuan tore off his clothes and looked at his body. At this moment, his body was at least emitting a faint glow!
Beside him, Lan Ruo smiled and said, "With your current physical body, ordinary Consolidation Realm experts can't do anything to you!"
As she spoke, she looked at Ye Xuan's body and said softly, "As expected of the number one Daoist Physique. It's indeed nature-defying!"
After putting on his clothes, Ye Xuan looked at Lan Ruo and cupped his fists. "Thank you, Miss Lan Ruo!"
Lan Ruo smiled and said, "What do you plan to do next?"
Ye Xuan said in a low voice, "Miss Lan Ruo, I want you to do something for me!" Lan Ruo said, "Speak!"
Ye Xuan said, "I want to auction the contents of the eighth Daoist scripture!"
Lan Ruo was stunned, then said, "You want to auction the contents of the eighth Daoist scripture?"
Ye Xuan nodded.
Lan Ruo asked in a low voice, "Are you short of money?"
Ye Xuan nodded. "I'm short of a lot!"
Lan Ruo looked at Ye Xuan. "You want to nurture those people in the Fifth Dimension!"
Ye Xuan nodded.
Lan Ruo was silent for a moment, then said, "How about this!
Sell the contents of the eighth Daoist scripture to me! "
Ye Xuan shook his head.
Lan Ruo looked at Ye Xuan. "The price I give you will not be low!"
Ye Xuan smiled. "Miss Lan Ruo, you've misunderstood me!"
As he spoke, he took out a scroll and handed it to Lan Ruo. "This is the contents of the eighth Daoist scripture. I'm giving it to you!"
Lan Ruo looked at Ye Xuan. "You're giving it to me?"
Ye Xuan smiled. "First, you helped me raise my cultivation base, and now you're helping me improve my physical body. If I were to sell you the eighth Daoist scripture, wouldn't I be too much of a good-for-nothing?
Miss Lan Ruo, I'm giving you the contents of the eighth Daoist scripture. However, I hope you won't spread it, because I'm still hoping to use this Daoist scripture to make a fortune! "
After a moment of silence, Lan Ruo took the scroll and said, "I'll accept the Daoist scripture!
However, I can't accept it for free! "
As she spoke, she took out a storage ring and handed it to Ye Xuan. "For you!"
Ye Xuan shook his head. "I've said it!
It's for you! "
Lan Ruo smiled. "You can take a look first!"
Ye Xuan took a look. His eyelids twitched, and his heart raced.
Lan Ruo smiled. "Take it!"
However, Ye Xuan shook his head. "I've said it!
It's for you! "
Lan Ruo looked at Ye Xuan. "Are you serious?"
Ye Xuan smiled. "A drop of kindness should be returned with a spring of gratitude!"
Lan Ruo smiled. "Then I want the ninth scroll!"
Ye Xuan opened his palm, and a Daoist scripture appeared in his hand. He looked at Lan Ruo and said, "This is the ninth scroll!"
Lan Ruo looked at Ye Xuan and didn't say anything.
Ye Xuan smiled. "Do you think I'm joking, Miss Lan Ruo?"
Lan Ruo shook her head and said softly, "Young Master Ye, I've realized that all of us have underestimated you!"
She turned around and left after she finished speaking.
She didn't take Ye Xuan's ninth Daoist scripture!
The value of the eighth Daoist scripture far exceeded what Xuan City had given Ye Xuan. If she took the ninth scroll as well, then this favor would be completely gone!
Not only that, but Xuan City would owe Ye Xuan a favor!
Moreover, greedy people usually didn't come to a good end!
Moreover, if Xuan City wanted to be friends with Ye Xuan, they had to know their limits. Ye Xuan always had a sense of propriety in his actions and words. Under such circumstances, Xuan City couldn't be greedy.
Inside the hall, Ye Xuan looked at the ninth Daoist scripture in front of him and shook his head with a smile.
He didn't expect Miss Lan Ruo to not take the ninth Daoist scripture!
Since the place had underestimated him, didn't he also underestimate Lan Ruo?
After a while, Ye Xuan left.
...
Somewhere in the starry sky, the Holy Master was running with a few people. They had already raised their speed to the maximum!
They had to stop the Taoists from searching for the plain-dressed woman!
After an unknown period of time, an old man beside him said in a deep voice, "Holy Master, I'm afraid we won't be able to catch up!"
The Holy Master stopped in his tracks. He looked at the end of the starry sky with an extremely gloomy expression. "Damn it, why are they running so fast? Are they rushing to reincarnate …?"
....。
PS: I've been quite busy lately because I'm going to look at buildings. I'm planning to buy a few buildings. Do you guys think it's better to buy a villa or a building?
Also, I'm planning to buy a car with four wheels. Do you guys think a Maserati or a Lamborghini is better?
Or should I buy one of both?
But I also feel that it's a little wasteful … and a little worried.







Chapter 1451
Somewhere in the starry sky, an old man was leading a group of experts as they traveled madly through the starry sky.
This old man was the Daoist Faction's Qing He.
At this moment, Qing He and the people behind him had raised their speed to their limits!
Because they wouldn't be able to catch up if they were too late!
Once the woman in a plain dress stepped into the Beastman Dimension, then they could only watch helplessly!
Because the Beastman Dimension wasn't a place they could step foot into.
So they had to be fast!
Because they were too fast, the starry sky was torn apart inch by inch wherever Qing He and the others passed. It was an extremely shocking scene!
Around an hour later, Qing He suddenly spoke with excitement, "We caught up!"
The people behind him looked up and saw a woman in a plain dress at the end of the starry sky.
At this moment, the woman in a plain dress suddenly stopped. There was an enormous stone stele not too far away from her, and there were four large words on the stone stele: Human Stop.
The border between the Beastman Dimension and the Human Dimension.
The woman in a plain dress continued forward.
Right at this moment, a thunderous voice resounded from behind her, "Stop!"
The woman in a plain dress turned around. The starry sky in the distance was suddenly torn apart, and in the next moment, five people appeared a few hundred meters away from her.
It was Qing He.
The woman in a plain dress looked at Qing He with a calm expression, and there wasn't the slightest fluctuation in her eyes.
Qing He looked at her with a solemn expression. He didn't dare underestimate her in the slightest because he noticed that he couldn't sense her aura at all!
There were two possibilities!
The first was that she had a special technique to conceal her aura. The second was that she was too strong!
Qing He restrained his thoughts and looked at her, "You're Ye Xuan's Dao Protector!"
Ye Xuan!
The woman's eyes flickered slightly when she heard this name, and she nodded slightly.
Qing He stared fixedly at her, "Have you heard of my Daoist Faction?"
The woman shook her head.
Qing He frowned slightly, "You haven't heard of the Daoist Faction!"
The woman glanced at Qing He, "How is he now?"
Qing He said, "You're talking about Ye Xuan?"
The woman nodded.
Qing He was expressionless, "He isn't doing very well!"
The woman's beautiful brows knit together slightly.
Qing He looked at the woman and said solemnly, "Have you really not heard of my Dao Sect?"
The woman in the plain dress looked at Qing He. "Is it your Dao Sect that is making things difficult for him?"
Qing He looked straight at the plain-dressed woman. "Yes!"
As he spoke, he slowly clenched his right hand, and a powerful force condensed in his right hand.
He didn't dare be careless in the slightest when facing this woman in a simple dress, and it wasn't just that, he was prepared to flee at any moment!
His objective for coming here this time was naturally to kill the woman in a plain dress. But if he couldn't kill her, then he would choose to flee decisively!
After all, the people behind Ye Xuan were not simple.
He had already thought of a way out!
The woman in the plain dress was silent. No one knew what she was thinking.
Qing He stared at the plain-dressed woman. "I heard that the Fifth Dimension Tendo and you are evenly matched?"
The plainly dressed woman thought for a moment and nodded. "Yes."
Qing He narrowed his eyes. "What realm are you at?"
The woman thought for a moment and said, "I'm a little taller than you!"
Qing He furrowed his brows. "Above Unity?"
The woman in the plain dress nodded.
Qing He suddenly disappeared on the spot, and in the next moment, a fist imprint suddenly appeared in front of the plain-dressed woman.
The woman raised her sword to block it.
Bang!
As an explosion sounded out, the woman in the plain dress retreated over a hundred feet. However, Qing He exploded violently.
However, Qing He had retreated over 1km!
After Qing He stopped moving, his eyes were filled with excitement. "You really aren't that strong!"
The woman's expression was calm as she glanced at Qing He and the others. "All of you can't kill me!"
Qing He fell silent.
The collision from before had allowed him to gain a rough understanding of her strength. Just as she'd said, she was at most above Unity.
However, they would definitely be unable to do anything to her!
It was too little!
Meanwhile, the woman in a plain dress spoke abruptly. "Why don't you go get more people?"
Qing He raised his head to look at her. "You're not running?"
She shook her head. "I'm not running!"
Qing He frowned slightly. "Why?"
She thought for a moment and said, "I'm tired from walking!
So, let's rest! "
Qing He gazed at her. "Are you sure you won't run?"
She nodded.
Qing He said, "Then just you wait!"
As soon as he finished speaking, he turned around and left.
Meanwhile, the woman in a plain dress spoke abruptly. "Get someone stronger."
Qing He turned around and glanced at her. "As you wish!"
As soon as he finished speaking, he turned around and vanished into the horizon.
However, the four of them who'd come with him hadn't left.
All of them were staring at the woman in a plain dress. Obviously, they were afraid that she would flee.
The woman in a plain dress turned around and gazed into the distance. No one knew what she was thinking.
She didn't want to go back!
Because she was afraid that she wouldn't want to leave once she returned!
However, she had no choice but to leave!
There were numerous Karmic Lines around her that ordinary people couldn't see!
Calamity Lines!
The dense expanse of Karmic Lines coiled around her like a dumpling!
All of them belonged to Ye Xuan!
She couldn't slash them all!
Boundless Karmic Lines!
She just didn't slash them!
In any case, these Calamity Lines couldn't do anything to her!
Actually, she could stay by Ye Xuan's side forever. So long as she stayed by Ye Xuan's side, then no matter how terrifying the Calamity Lines were, they wouldn't be able to do anything to Ye Xuan.
However, she still wanted to find the source!
Who exactly is controlling all of this?
The woman in a plain dress slowly closed her eyes, "Don't let me find you!"
...
Somewhere in the starry sky, Qing He who was rushing towards the Dao Sect suddenly stopped!
Because he'd encountered the Sacred Leader and the others!
Qing He looked at the Sacred Leader, "All of you came to kill that woman as well?"
The Sacred Leader stared at Qing He, "All of you found her?"
Qing He nodded.
The Sacred Leader frowned slightly, "You didn't die?"
Qing He sneered, "All of you overestimate her!
She's just that. "
The Sacred Leader's frown deepened, "Just that?"
Qing He smiled, "Why? All of you think she's very strong?"
The Sacred Leader fell silent.
He was slightly puzzled.
That shouldn't be the case!
There was no reason for Master to lie to him!
At this moment, Qing He suddenly said, "Sacred Leader, are you here to kill this person as well?"
The Sacred Leader hesitated for a moment before shaking his head, "No!"
Qing He was slightly puzzled, "Then why did you come here?"
The Sacred Leader fell silent. Could it be that I'm here to stop you from sending yourself to death?
The Sacred Leader shook his head and said, "Qing He, you've fought her before?"
Qing He nodded.
The Sacred Leader was slightly puzzled, "Is she really not that strong?"
Qing He frowned slightly, "Sacred Leader, why do you think she's very strong?"
The Sacred Leader: "…"
Qing He
Suddenly, he said, "Sacred Leader, you came at the right time. If we join forces, we can definitely kill this person!"
The Sacred Leader hurriedly shook his head, "I'm just passing by!"
As he said this, he looked at Qing He, "Are you going back?"
Qing He nodded, "Although this woman isn't as strong as the white-robed woman, we can't underestimate her. It's still a little difficult for us to kill her, so …"
The Sacred Leader suddenly said, "So you're going back to call for help?"
Qing He nodded.
The Sacred Leader said in a deep voice, "Have you ever thought that this matter is a little strange?"
Qing He frowned slightly, "Strange?"
The Sacred Leader said in a deep voice, "I think she might have deliberately asked you to go back and call for help!"
Qing He said in a deep voice, "You're saying that she deliberately showed weakness?"
The Sacred Leader nodded.
Qing He shook his head, "Absolutely impossible!"
The Sacred Leader was slightly puzzled, "Why is it impossible?"
Qing He said, "Why would she show weakness?"
The Sacred Leader fell silent. He didn't know why she would show weakness!
Qing He continued, "If she's really extremely strong, then why didn't she appear when Ye Xuan was targeted by the Whirling World?
Moreover, if she's really strong, then why didn't she just go to my Taoist Faction and destroy it?
Why did she show weakness?
What's the point of that? "
The Sacred Leader fell silent.
Indeed, he didn't understand. If she was really as strong as his Master said, then why didn't she just destroy the Taoist Faction?
Or did she not take the Taoist Faction seriously at all?
Or did she disdain to go to the Taoist Faction?
Meanwhile, Qing He suddenly said, "According to what we know, she's always called herself Ye Xuan's younger sister, so she definitely has an extremely good relationship with Ye Xuan. If we can capture her, then we can use her to threaten Ye Xuan and make Ye Xuan hesitate in taking action. Moreover, it might even make the white-robed woman behind Ye Xuan hesitate in taking action."
The Sacred Leader looked at Qing He and was about to speak. Meanwhile, Qing He suddenly said, "Let's not waste any more time!
Sacred Leader, let's talk another day! "
After saying that, he turned and disappeared into the horizon.
In the starry sky, the Sacred Leader fell silent.
He still felt that something was wrong. Because his Master had no reason to lie to him!
In other words, there was only one explanation. That was, the woman deliberately showed weakness and deliberately made Qing He go back to call for help.
Thinking of this, the Sacred Leader said softly, "This Taoist Faction is going to be tricked!"
Saying that, he shook his head, "With such a teammate … I'm a little panicked!"
...
Taoist Faction.
Qing He rushed back to Daoting as fast as he could.
In a pavilion, the Second Brother looked at Qing He, "She told you to come back and call for help?"
Qing He nodded, "Yes!"
The Second Brother fell silent, "This matter is a little strange!"
Qing He hurriedly shook his head, "No, I think she underestimated the enemy!"
The Second Brother was a little puzzled, "Underestimated the enemy?"
Qing He nodded, "Although this woman is not good with words, I can feel that she is very arrogant. When she looks at me, it feels like she is looking at an ant!
Moreover, she is a Swordsman and has never heard of our Taoist Faction. Therefore, I feel that she has no idea how strong our Taoist Faction is. In her eyes, our Taoist Faction might be some third-rate force. "
The Second Brother fell silent.
Qing He continued, "I have fought with this woman. Although she did not use her sword, I have a rough idea of her strength.
She is an expert, but compared to the white-robed woman and Situ Tingyun, there is still a big gap. This woman is our breakthrough point. Once we capture this woman, not only can we threaten Ye Xuan and make Ye Xuan hesitate, we can also use this woman to understand the force behind Ye Xuan. It can be said to be killing two birds with one stone. "
The Second Brother was still silent. Obviously, he was a little hesitant because he felt that things might not be so simple.
Qing He was a little anxious, "Second Master, this is a rare opportunity. Let's do it!"
..







Chapter 1452
A once-in-a-lifetime opportunity!
Second Brother Dao narrowed his eyes, "I'll go myself!"
Qing He shook his head, "No need!
As long as you give me ten Consolidation Realm experts!
As for you, Second Master, Fourth Master is in closed door cultivation. Just in case, you have to personally guard this place. "
Second Brother Dao said in a low voice, "Is ten enough?"
Qing He smiled, "Enough!"
Second Brother Dao thought for a moment and shook his head, "We still can't be careless!
How about this, I'll ask the Wen Institution's Head, Wen Tianyu, to go with you. "
Qing He nodded, "In this way, it's basically foolproof!"
Second Brother Dao frowned, "Don't be careless!"
Qing He smiled, "Understood!"
A moment later, Qing He left the Dao Sect with ten Consolidation Realm experts and the Wen Institution's Head, Wen Tianyu, and headed straight for the depths of the starry sky.
Second Brother Dao slowly closed his eyes, and he felt quite uneasy in his heart.
A moment later, Second Brother Dao opened his eyes, and they were filled with coldness.
Who had the Dao Sect been afraid of?
Who had they been afraid of?
...
Somewhere in the starry sky, the Sacred Lord didn't leave with everyone. Instead, he came to the starry sky where the woman in the plain dress was.
He wanted to see exactly who this woman in the plain dress was!
When he saw the woman in the plain dress, the Sacred Lord's expression instantly became solemn!
His strength and knowledge were far beyond Qing He's. The moment he saw the woman in the plain dress, he knew that she was deliberately showing weakness!
This woman was very strong!
But he didn't know exactly how strong she was.
At this moment, the woman in the plain dress turned to look at the Sacred Lord. The Sacred Lord's expression changed, and he didn't hesitate to turn around and leave.
He knew that if he didn't leave now, he might not be able to leave later!
The woman in the plain dress didn't make a move and allowed the Sacred Lord and the others to leave.
The woman in the plain dress stood in the starry sky. She looked into the depths of the starry sky, and she held a small wooden figure in her hand.
This small wooden figure looked exactly like Ye Xuan!
After a long time, the woman in the plain dress withdrew her gaze and looked at the small wooden figure. When she saw it, a rare trace of gentleness flashed in her eyes.
At this moment, the space behind her suddenly trembled. In the next moment, a dozen powerful auras suddenly appeared behind her. Not long after, Qing He and the others appeared behind the woman in the plain dress.
Qing He instantly heaved a sigh of relief when he saw that the woman in a plain dress hadn't left.
All along the way, he was rather worried that the woman in a plain dress would flee. If the woman in a plain dress fled, then it would be equivalent to missing a rare opportunity!
Fortunately, the woman did not run away!
Wen Tianyu, the head of the academy, said abruptly, "Retreat!"
Retreat?
Qing He was stunned when he heard Wen Tianyu, and then he said, "What do you mean by that?"
Wen Tianyu looked at Qing He. "Retreat!"
With that, he turned around and left.
At this moment, Wen Tianyu's expression was extremely solemn. To be exact, he was a little nervous.
The instant he saw her, he knew that she wasn't an ordinary person.
This was a conspiracy!
Therefore, he decisively chose to leave!
However, it was a little too late.
A wisp of sword light had pierced through his glabella!
It was completely silent!
Wen Tianyu stood rooted to the ground, his eyes glazed over.
When did she use her sword?
He didn't know!
He only knew that he was dead!
On the other hand, Qing He and the others were stunned. Wen Tianyu is dead?
As if he'd thought of something, Qing He turned around to look at the woman in a plain dress, and his voice trembled as he said, "It's you …."
The woman glanced at Qing He. "How boring!"
As soon as she finished speaking, she turned around and left.
Qing He was about to speak when the heads of over a dozen experts flew into the air.
The heads of more than a dozen experts flew out one after another. Fresh blood gushed out like a fountain. It was extremely bloody.
Qing He was slightly stunned. In next to no time, he covered his neck with both hands because his throat had suddenly split open and blood sprayed out!
Qing He was horrified, and his soul was about to flee. At his level, even if his body was destroyed, so long as his soul remained, then he could be reborn.
However, when his soul was about to flee, he noticed to his astonishment that his soul was gradually vanishing.
Qing He stood on the spot.
He knew that he was dead!
His soul had been obliterated!
Qing He raised his head to look at the woman in a plain dress. "Is it fun to act weak …?"
In the distance, the woman didn't even turn around. She felt that she was wasting time.
Such a weak person shouldn't be a threat to her brother. Let him play by himself!
In the battlefield, Qing He wanted to inform his second brother before he died, but he was powerless to do so.
Right now, he only had a sliver of consciousness. His soul and body had been erased.
This sliver of consciousness had no roots or roots, so it had no meaning. Moreover, this sliver of consciousness was also vanishing.
That sword had directly erased everything he had!
Tens of thousands of years of cultivation, gone in an instant!
....
In the distance, the woman in a plain dress had already stepped into the Beastman World. The moment she stepped into the Beastman World, a voice suddenly sounded from the distant starry sky. "Human, this is the Beastman World."
The woman didn't stop and continued to walk into the distance.
At this moment, a shadow suddenly appeared not far away from the woman in a plain dress. The shadow gradually solidified, and soon, an expert with the face of a beast appeared in front of the woman in a plain dress.
This Beastman expert looked at the woman in a plain dress. "This is the Beastman World!"
The woman in a plain dress looked at the Beastman expert. "Excuse me!"
The Beastman expert looked straight at the woman in a plain dress. "No!"
The woman in a plain dress suddenly pulled out her sword.
Hiss!
A strand of sword light tore through the sky. The Beastman expert's pupils constricted. He wanted to resist, but as soon as the thought arose in his mind, his head flew into the air!
However, the strand of sword light didn't disappear. It tore through the sky and traveled a distance of 500,000km!
The starry sky within 500,000km was destroyed inch by inch!
This sword had directly destroyed the border between the Beastman World and the Human World.
At this moment, the entire Beastman World was shocked.
A human expert had invaded?
At this moment, a middle-aged man appeared in front of the woman in a plain dress. The middle-aged man didn't seem much different from a human, and the only difference was his eyes. His eyes were dark purple.
The middle-aged man looked at the woman in a plain dress with an extremely solemn expression.
Danger!
That was what he felt at this moment!
How many years has it been since he felt danger?
The woman didn't stop and continued forward.
The middle-aged man said in a low voice, "Human, my Beastman Race once signed an agreement with your Dao Sect's ancestor to not invade our race. Why have you come to invade my Beastman Race!?"
The woman in a plain dress looked at the middle-aged man. "I'm just passing by!"
The middle-aged man was stunned, and then he said, "You're just passing by … Then why did you kill people and destroy this world!?"
The woman in a plain dress looked at the middle-aged man. "You're not satisfied?"
The middle-aged man: "…"
The woman in a plain dress continued forward.
The middle-aged man fell silent.
When the woman passed by the middle-aged man, she turned around and glanced at him, "Compared to those people from before, you don't seem so weak."
The middle-aged man: "…"
The woman in a plain dress opened her palm, and the little wooden figure appeared in her hand. She looked at the middle-aged man. "This is my brother!"
The middle-aged man glanced at the little wooden figure and hesitated for a moment. "What do you mean!?"
Su?
The woman in a plain dress said, "Perhaps he will come here one day. If he does, give me some face and don't bully him, alright?"
The middle-aged man looked at the woman in a plain dress. "What if I don't agree?"
The woman opened her palm.
A sword suddenly flew out. The sword shot into the depths of the starry sky and arrived at the Beastman World. In an instant, the entire starry sky turned illusory!
The middle-aged man's expression changed drastically when he saw this scene!
This woman wants to destroy the entire Beastman World!
As the sword descended, the entire Beastman World started to collapse inch by inch!
True collapse!
Under this sword, even the origin of the entire Beastman World was dissipating.
The middle-aged man hurriedly said, "Senior … please have mercy!
I, I agree! "
At this moment, he suddenly understood that this woman was not just a little stronger than him, but many, many, many, many, many points!
He could not block that sword!
The Beastman World could not block it either!
The woman in a plain dress looked at the middle-aged man expressionlessly. "Too late!"
As she spoke, her right hand pressed down lightly. The sword sank down and the sky above the Beastman World darkened.
The middle-aged man said with a trembling voice, "Senior … please have mercy!"
He had never been so humble in his life!
When had the Beastman Race ever suffered such humiliation?
He also wanted to fight, he also wanted to be unyielding!
But his strength did not allow him to!
The moment this woman in a plain dress attacked, he felt despair!
This woman was so powerful that he felt despair!
At this moment, the woman in a plain dress stopped. After a moment of silence, she said, "For my brother's sake, I will ask you again."
As she spoke, she took out the little wooden figure. "This is my brother!
If he comes here, don't bully him, alright? "
The middle-aged man hurriedly said, "Alright, alright, alright!"
The woman in a plain dress nodded. "Wouldn't everything be fine if you answered like that just now?"
The middle-aged man laughed bitterly. I didn't know you were so abnormal!
The woman in a plain dress did not speak further. She walked towards the distance, but she stopped in next to no time. The middle-aged man's expression instantly changed when he saw this.
The woman in a plain dress turned to glance at the middle-aged man. "There is a familiar aura here … Do you know a little girl with a horn on her head?"
A little girl with a horn on her head?
The middle-aged man was stunned, and then he said with a trembling voice, "Senior, you know Miss Erya?"
The woman in a plain dress nodded. "Has she been here?"
The middle-aged man nodded and said respectfully, "Yes, she has passed by here … Senior, what is your relationship with Miss Erya?"
The woman in a plain dress thought for a moment and said, "Enemy!"
Enemy!
The middle-aged man's expression was slightly strange. "Enemy?
Senior … that Miss Erya is very, very strong. She said that besides her brother, no one is a match for her … "
The woman in a plain dress had a calm expression. "Did she say that?"
The middle-aged man nodded. "Yes!"
The woman in a plain dress did not speak. She turned around and continued forward.
The middle-aged man hesitated for a moment and said, "Senior, do you need us to take care of your brother?"
The woman in a plain dress did not even turn her head. "Up to you!"
The middle-aged man nodded and felt relieved. He did not really want to get involved in these things. Especially to take care of a human, he was still slightly disgusted and resistant.
At this moment, the woman in a plain dress said, "You can take care of him or not. But if anything happens to him, all of you will be buried with him!"
The middle-aged man was petrified on the spot.
F * ck me …

Chapter 1453
Taoism.
Second Elder Dao, who was sitting cross-legged in the wooden house, suddenly opened his eyes. At this moment, an old man suddenly appeared in front of him, and the old man said in a low voice, "Qinghe and Dean Wen have all fallen."
All fallen!
Second Elder Dao was surprisingly calm.
The old man glanced at Second Elder Dao and said, "Second Elder …"
Second Elder Dao slowly closed his eyes, "I understand!"
The old man bowed slightly and left.
Second Elder Dao was silent for a long time in the wooden house, and then he stood up and left.
Second Elder Dao walked towards the back of the mountain, and before long, he arrived before a mountain wall. He looked at the mountain wall in front of him and said softly, "The Taoism is in danger!"
After a moment of silence, the mountain wall suddenly trembled, and then it split open, and an old man in a gray robe walked out.
The old man looked at Second Elder Dao, "The Taoism is in danger?"
Second Elder Dao nodded, "Ask everyone who is in closed door cultivation to come out!"
The old man frowned slightly, "What exactly happened?"
Second Elder Dao said softly, "The nine Dao scriptures have been gathered, and the spirit of the Grand Dao is about to appear!"
The old man was stunned, "Isn't that a good thing?"
Second Elder Dao looked at the old man, "Those who possess the nine Dao scriptures are the mortal enemies of the Taoism!"
The old man in gray was speechless.
Second Elder Dao said, "Mu Xing, I want to immediately recall all the disciples in Wuyuan, and all the elders and protectors who are in closed door cultivation to come out immediately."
Mu Xing said in a low voice, "Is it that serious?"
Second Elder Dao glanced at Mu Xing, "The Taoism has lost more than 20 experts so far, including Qinghe and the Dean of the Wen Academy!"
Mu Xing's expression became serious when he heard this.
Second Elder Dao slowly closed his eyes, "I want to see how strong the forces behind Ye Xuan are!
Let's see if they can destroy the Taoism! "
....
Boundless Sacred Ground.
The Holy Lord came to the small bamboo house once more, and he said in a low voice, "Master, all the people from the Taoism have fallen, including the Dean of the Wen Academy, Wen Tianyu!"
Within the bamboo house, the woman picked up the teacup and took a light sip, and then she said softly, "Isn't this very normal?"
The Holy Lord said in a low voice, "Master, that woman in a plain dress is extremely dangerous!"
"Danger?"
The woman smiled and said, "You underestimated her too much!
She's not dangerous, she's terrifying. She's the most dangerous person in the world, and also the most terrifying person. "
The Holy Lord hesitated for a moment and then asked, "Master, why do you know that woman in a plain dress so well?"
The woman smiled and did not answer the question. Instead, she stood up and left the bamboo house. Outside the bamboo house, the Sacred Leader hurriedly bowed.
The woman looked at the end of the horizon and said softly, "The Second Daoist probably won't give up, right?"
The Sacred Master nodded. "I've already received news that he has begun to recall all the Dao Sect's disciples who are outside."
The woman asked, "Is he going to start attacking Ye Xuan?"
Holy Master shook his head. "From what I know, he might be trying to destroy the forces behind Ye Xuan!"
The woman was stunned, and then she said, "Why isn't he looking for Ye Xuan directly? Why is he looking for the forces behind Ye Xuan?"
The Sacred Leader hesitated for a moment and said, "Perhaps he feels that the forces behind Ye Xuan are a huge threat …. So, he wants to deal with the forces behind Ye Xuan first!"
The woman suddenly asked, "Is the Second Daoist an idiot?"
The Sacred Leader was speechless.
The woman shook her head. "The Dao Sect's ancestor is quite a figure, so why did he take in such an idiot?
I can't figure it out! "
The Sacred Leader hesitated for a moment and said, "Actually, the Second Daoist is very strong!
However, they're used to being superior!
After all, the Dao Sect was practically invincible all those years ago, and the Four Saints of the Dao Sect were extremely famous …. The Dao Sect has never suffered such humiliation, and this is probably the first time. "
The woman smiled and said, "Actually, it's fine. I don't want Ye Xuan to be so free and unfettered. It's not a bad thing for us to have the Dao Sect cause trouble for him!"
The Sacred Leader said in a low voice, "Master, Ye Xuan is auctioning the contents of the eighth scripture in Xuan City …."
The woman glanced at the Sacred Leader. "You want it?"
The Sacred Leader nodded.
The woman smiled and said, "Then go and bid for it!"
The Sacred Leader wanted to say something but hesitated.
The woman said softly, "You want to ask if the people behind Ye Xuan are so terrifying, why do we still want to be enemies with them, right?"
The Sacred Leader nodded.
The woman smiled and said, "This is a grudge between me and them."
The Sacred Leader bowed slightly and didn't ask any further questions.
A moment later, the Sacred Leader left.
The woman looked up into the sky, and her smile gradually turned cold as she thought of something.
...
Xuan City.
A grand auction was about to be held under the arrangements of Lan Ruo, the City Lord of Xuan City.
There was only one thing to be auctioned in this auction!
The Dao Scripture!
The contents of the eighth scripture!
Countless forces and experts rushed to Xuan City when they heard the news.
At this moment, Xuan City was unprecedentedly bustling.
City Lord Manor, inside the hall.
Lan Ruo looked at Ye Xuan. "How many fortune divine crystals are you going to auction?"
Ye Xuan asked, "Are the fortune divine crystals the common currency now?"
Lan Ruo nodded. "Yes!
Of course, some precious elixirs are also counted. However, these elixirs are too rare and hard to come by. "
Ye Xuan thought for a moment and said, "Then let's go with the fortune divine crystals!
In Miss Lan Ruo's opinion, how many fortune divine crystals can the contents of the eighth scripture be sold for? "
Lan Ruo looked at Ye Xuan. "A priceless treasure that can't be estimated!"
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "There shouldn't be anyone coming to snatch it, right?"
Lan Ruo smiled and said, "You can rest assured in Xuan City unless all the experts from the Dao sects rush here."
Ye Xuan cupped his fists and said, "Then I'll have to trouble Miss Lan Ruo this time!"
Lan Ruo smiled and said, "You're welcome!"
At this moment, an old man walked in and bowed slightly. "City Lord, everything is ready!"
Lan Ruo looked at Ye Xuan and smiled. "Young Master Ye, let's go!"
Ye Xuan nodded and said, "Alright!"
Under Lan Ruo's lead, Ye Xuan arrived at the auction site. Ye Xuan scanned the area and realized that there were very few people around. There were only a few dozen of them!
Lan Ruo smiled and said, "We've done a screening. After all, there are only a few powerful forces."
Ye Xuan nodded and said, "Alright!"
Lan Ruo pointed to the round stage in the distance and said, "Young Master Ye, are you going to do it yourself, or do you want one of us to do it?"
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "I'll do it!"
With that, he appeared on the round stage.
At this moment, everyone's eyes fell on Ye Xuan.
Ye Xuan glanced at the surroundings and noticed that the weakest amongst them was at the Consolidation Realm. Besides that, there were a few extremely powerful auras!
He even saw three familiar faces!
Nan Yue Xiu, Nan Yueqi, and Nan Yueqing!
The Nan Yue Clan!
When he saw Ye Xuan look over, Nan Yue Xiu smiled as a greeting!
Ye Xuan cupped his fists and looked around. "Everyone, I won't waste my breath!
Let's get straight to the point! "
As he spoke, he opened his palm and an ancient scroll appeared in his hand. "The contents of the eighth Daoist scripture. The starting price …"
He hesitated for a moment and looked at Lan Ruo. Lan Ruo smiled and raised a finger.
Ye Xuan immediately said, "The starting price is 10,000,000 Fortune Crystals!"
Lan Ruo was stunned when he heard this, and everyone else was stunned as well.
10,000,000 Fortune Crystals?
The silence was terrifying!
The atmosphere was very strange!
Ye Xuan gazed at Lan Ruo. Lan Ruo hesitated for a moment, and then he said via voice transmission, "I mean, 1,000,000,000!"
1,000,000,000!
Ye Xuan's face froze.
He realized that he seemed to have underestimated this scripture!
Lan Ruo continued, "This scripture is a precious treasure of the Daoist Path, and it's even the eighth volume. Its value can't be measured with money!
Actually, a bid of 1,000,000,000 is too little! "
Ye Xuan was a little embarrassed. He was a little embarrassed!
Lan Ruo rolled his eyes at Ye Xuan, and then he shouted, "100,000,000!"
100,000,000!
The atmosphere instantly returned to normal when Lan Ruo from Xuancheng made a bid!
At this moment …
An old man said in a hoarse voice, "200,000,000!"
"300,000,000!"
"500,000,000 …"
The price rose higher and higher.
Ye Xuan was quite excited. Just as Lan Ruo had said, he had underestimated this scripture!
The price rose higher and higher, and it didn't take long for it to reach 1,100,000,000!
1,100,000,000 Fortune Crystals!
Ye Xuan fell silent.
1.1 billion Fortune Divine Crystals ah!
How many experts would he be able to nurture if he brought them to the Fifth Dimension!
I'm still too poor!
He'd already made up his mind. He would auction off the ninth volume once he finished studying it!
Right at this moment, a voice suddenly resounded. "3,000,000,000!"
3,000,000,000!
As soon as this was said, the surroundings fell silent once more.
Ye Xuan looked at the person who'd spoken. It was an old man in a black robe, and his face couldn't be seen.
Lan Ruo glanced at the old man as well, and then she sent a voice transmission to Ye Xuan. "The Ancient Race!
He's extremely strong! "
Ye Xuan nodded, and then he glanced at the surroundings and said, "Is there anyone else who has a higher bid than this senior?"
The surroundings fell silent.
Ye Xuan was about to speak when a voice suddenly resounded. "Young Master Ye, my Southyue Race doesn't have that many Fortune Crystals, but we can use medicinal pills to exchange for them."
As he spoke, he waved his right hand, and a few hundred bottles of medicinal pills appeared in front of Ye Xuan.
Ye Xuan glanced at the medicinal pills, and then he turned to look at Lan Ruo. Lan Ruo glanced at the medicinal pills and said, "They're worth over 3,000,000,000 Fortune Crystals!
These medicinal pills are sufficient to allow a huge batch of Dao Formation Realm experts to appear in the Fifth Dimension! "
A huge batch of Dao Formation Realm experts!
Ye Xuan was slightly tempted.
Meanwhile, the old man from the Ancient Race suddenly said, "It's medicinal pills!
My Ancient Race has them as well! "
As soon as he finished speaking, he opened his palm, and a few hundred bottles of medicinal pills appeared in front of Ye Xuan.
The old man looked at Ye Xuan. "Young Master Ye, what do you think about 3,000,000,000 and these medicinal pills?"
Ye Xuan turned to look at Nanyue Xiu, but the latter remained silent.
The value of the Dao Scriptures far exceeded these medicinal pills, but if the Southyue Race continued to buy them, then it would truly be a huge blow!
When Nanyue Xiu remained silent, Ye Xuan looked at the old man and smiled. "Deal!"
As soon as he finished speaking, he flicked his finger, and the scroll landed in front of the old man.
The old man was very straightforward, and he flicked his finger, and a spatial ring landed in front of Ye Xuan.
Ye Xuan glanced at it, and there were exactly 3,000,000,000 medicinal pills within it!
The old man was about to leave when Ye Xuan suddenly said, "I wonder if there are any from the Daoist Faction!"
The Daoist Faction!
Everyone looked at Ye Xuan.
Ye Xuan smiled. "There aren't any?"
Meanwhile, an old man suddenly appeared not too far away from Ye Xuan, and he gazed at Ye Xuan. "What?"
It was obvious that he was from the Daoist Faction.
Ye Xuan glanced at everyone here, and then he pointed at the old man. "I'll give the eighth scripture to anyone who kills him for free!"
The surroundings fell silent.
The old man sneered. "Who dares?"
Right at this moment, a cold light flashed through the surroundings.
The old man's expression changed drastically, and he turned around abruptly. In the next moment, the cold light had already pierced through his forehead!
His soul was annihilated!
At the same time, a shadow appeared not too far away from Ye Xuan.
The shadow was hazy and couldn't be seen clearly.
In the field, everyone looked at the shadow.
What guts!
The shadow extended his right hand to Ye Xuan.
Ye Xuan flicked his finger, and an ancient scroll appeared in front of the shadow.
The shadow glanced at the scroll, then turned around and left.
At this moment, Ye Xuan suddenly said, "Do you have any thoughts on the ninth scripture?"
The shadow stopped. A moment later, he said, "Who should I kill?"
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "Ten Dao Sect Consolidation Realm powerhouses!"
The shadow fell silent.
Ye Xuan looked around and smiled. "I'll give the eighth scripture to anyone who kills a Dao Consolidation Realm cultivator. I'll give the ninth scripture to anyone who kills ten!
If there are more than twenty, I'll take them to the Ninth Dimension to play! "
Everyone: "…"
...







Chapter 1454
The Ninth Dimension!
Rumor had it that the Ninth Dimension was the Son of the Dimension!
However, no one really believed it. However, the power behind Ye Xuan was too mysterious!
Did this guy really come from the Ninth Dimension?
But where was the Ninth Dimension?
Everyone was puzzled.
At this moment, the figure in front of Ye Xuan said, "Kill ten and you'll give me the ninth Dao Scripture. Really?"
Ye Xuan pointed at himself. "When have I ever lied to anyone?"
The figure said, "Wait!"
After saying that, he disappeared.
The people in the hall were silent.
Killing a Consolidation Realm expert could exchange for the eighth Dao Scripture!
That was really worth it!
But that was the Dao Sect!
Although they were tempted, they did not dare to act!
At this moment, Ye Xuan suddenly smiled. "Everyone, I know you don't want to be enemies with the Dao Sect!
However, if you can't do it in the open, you can do it in the dark!
In any case, as long as you hide well, who will know it was you who killed them? "
Everyone took a look at Ye Xuan. Damn it. This guy is so bad!
Ye Xuan smiled. "Why is the Dao Sect so powerful?
That's because they have the Dao Scripture. If you get the eighth and ninth Dao Scripture, you can also be as powerful!
The opportunity is right in front of you, it would be a pity if you don't cherish it! "
At this moment, a voice suddenly sounded from the dark. "We can also choose to kill you!"
Everyone looked at Ye Xuan.
Ye Xuan was silent for a moment. The next moment, a powerful bloodline power suddenly swept out from his body.
Boom!
The surrounding space directly trembled!
After seeing the power of Ye Xuan's bloodline, everyone's expression changed!
Lan Ruo's expression gradually became solemn.
Ye Xuan smiled. "I think everyone must be very curious about my background …"
As he said that, he looked at everyone and smiled. "To tell you the truth, I am the son of the Ninth Dimension. This bloodline is the first bloodline of the Ninth Dimension, the Crazy Demon Bloodline."
The son of the Ninth Dimension!
The hall became silent!
Naturally, they did not believe it!
But Ye Xuan's bloodline was really too strange!
Too powerful!
And they had never heard of this bloodline!
This was very abnormal!
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "Everyone should have investigated me, Ye Xuan. Everyone should be very clear about what kind of person I, Ye Xuan, am.
First, I only want to protect my Five-Dimensional Universe. I have no interest in your territories!
Secondly, in my heart, the Daoist scriptures are like dung. Why?
Because in our Nine Dimensions, this kind of thing is really just so-so. "
After saying this, he looked at everyone. "Everyone should know what I, Ye Xuan, have done in the Fifth Dimension. I, Ye Xuan, like to make friends. If everyone is willing to be friends with me, Ye Xuan, I will give you Dao Scriptures for free!
Let's cultivate together and become stronger together!
I, Ye Xuan, never eat alone.
If you don't want to be friends with me, that's fine too. My way of thinking is that even if we can't be friends, we shouldn't be enemies!
As long as everyone doesn't become enemies with me, Ye Xuan, I, Ye Xuan, will never offend any of you. "
Everyone in the hall was silent.
Lan Ruo glanced at Ye Xuan and remained silent. No one knew what he was thinking.
At this moment, Ye Xuan said, "It's fine if you don't want to get involved in this. As long as you kill the people from the Daoist Faction, I will give you the contents of the Dao Scriptures."
No one in the hall said anything.
At this moment, many people already had some ideas. However, they were not stupid enough to express them here!
Killing an expert from the Daoist Faction would give them the contents of the eighth volume!
This was too worth it!
The temptation was huge!
Many people were tempted!
It was worth the risk!
Soon, some people in the hall left.
Everyone left.
After everyone left, Lan Ruo walked in front of Ye Xuan and smiled. "They will make a move!"
Ye Xuan smiled. "Will they?"
Lan Ruo looked at Ye Xuan. "If I didn't get the eighth volume of the Dao Scriptures, I would definitely do that!
Killing one person for a volume of the Dao Scriptures. This is too worth it!
However, if you do that, it's equivalent to declaring war on the Daoist Faction! "
Ye Xuan chuckled. "If I don't do that, will they let me go?"
Lan Ruo shook her head. "No!"
Ye Xuan suddenly asked, "What about the Boundless Sacred Ground?
Have they made any moves? "
Lan Ruo shook her head. "The Boundless Sacred Ground is very quiet. They haven't made any moves!"
Ye Xuan was silent.
Lan Ruo said in a low voice, "The Daoist Faction has made a big move. From what I know, they have already gathered all the Daoist Faction disciples outside. Not only that, some hidden experts from the Daoist Faction have also come out of seclusion. They might be up to something big soon. You must be mentally prepared!"
Something big!
Ye Xuan said softly, "Miss Lan Ruo, what level is Second Brother Dao's expert at?"
Lan Ruo said in a low voice, "He should be half a step into the Divine State."
Ye Xuan frowned. "Divine State?"
Lan Ruo nodded. "The so-called Divine State refers to the ability to reverse the deathly aura in one's body and gradually convert it into life aura. To a certain extent, it's very difficult for experts of this level to die normally. This is because they can slowly reverse the deathly aura and convert it into life aura.
Although it's not considered eternal life, it's more than enough to live for hundreds of thousands of years. "
As she spoke, she looked at Ye Xuan. "In the end, the goal of everyone's cultivation is actually to live longer."
Ye Xuan nodded. "I understand now!"
Lan Ruo continued, "The white-robed lady and Situ Tingyun who attacked just now are naturally extremely powerful. However, the Daoist Faction might not be particularly afraid of them. This is because the Daoist Faction has a very deep foundation. You must understand that the cultivation realms of the various worlds are all created by the Daoist Faction's patriarch.
Although the Daoist Faction's patriarch is no longer around, you still cannot underestimate the Daoist Faction. "
Ye Xuan shook his head. "Actually, I still don't understand why the Daoist Faction wants me dead."
Lan Ruo looked at Ye Xuan. "Because you've gathered all nine scrolls of the Dao Scripture!
If you summon the Spirit of the Great Dao, you'll be the leader of the Daoist Faction.
Although you have no intention of being the leader of the Daoist Faction, the people of the Daoist Faction will not allow you to summon the Spirit of the Great Dao. "
As she spoke, she paused before continuing, "Actually, most of the time, when people want you dead, it's not because you want to be their enemy, but because you have the ability to threaten them. To them, that's enough."
Ye Xuan chuckled. "I understand now!
Miss Lan Ruo, I want to go somewhere. Are you interested in coming with me? "
Lan Ruo was a little curious. "Where?"
Ye Xuan shook his head. "I don't know either!
Before Qing 'er left, she gave me a map. It's obvious that she wants me to go to that place. "
Lan Ruo asked, "The white-robed woman?"
Ye Xuan nodded.
After a moment of silence, Lan Ruo said, "Young Master Ye, this might be a fortuitous encounter. Are you sure you want me to go with you?"
Ye Xuan smiled. "I'm sure. It all depends on whether Miss Lan Ruo is willing!"
Lan Ruo looked at Ye Xuan. After a moment, she smiled. "Of course!"
Ye Xuan smiled. "Then let's go!"
Lan Ruo nodded. "Let's go!"
Soon, Ye Xuan and Lan Ruo left Xuan City.
...
Daoist Faction.
On this day, an old man suddenly came to the bamboo house where Second Brother Dao was. The old man said in a deep voice, "Second Brother, that Ye Xuan has spread the word in Xuan City that anyone who kills a Consolidation Realm expert of our Daoist Faction will immediately obtain the contents of the eighth scroll. If he kills more than ten people, he will obtain the contents of the ninth scroll!"
Second Brother Dao was expressionless. "Does anyone dare?"
The old man said in a deep voice, "We've already lost contact with two Consolidation Realm experts.
.....”
Second Brother Dao narrowed his eyes with murderous intent. "Who is it!"
The old man shook his head. "I don't know!"
Second Brother Dao was about to speak when footsteps suddenly sounded from outside the door. The next moment, a man walked in!
The second Dao Brother was stunned when he saw the woman. The old man was also stunned, but he quickly came back to his senses and bowed respectfully. "Fourth Master!"
The woman in front of him was one of the Four Sages of Daoist Faction, Fourth Brother Dao!
Second Brother Dao said softly, "Fourth Brother, you've come out of seclusion?"
Fourth Brother Dao nodded. He smiled. "This Ye Xuan is using the Dao Scripture to tempt those forces into becoming enemies with us!"
Second Brother Dao said, "What do you think, Fourth Brother?"
Fourth Brother Dao shook his head. "We can't find trouble with those forces who killed our experts. If we do that, we'll be playing into Ye Xuan's hands!"
Second Brother Dao frowned. "Just let it go?"
Fourth Brother Dao nodded. "Not only that, we have to be on good terms with those forces.
Ye Xuan has the Dao Scripture in his hands, and we also have the contents of the Dao Scripture, don't we? "
Second Brother Dao said softly, "You mean, we can also learn from Ye Xuan?"
Fourth Brother Dao smiled. "Those people dared to kill our people for the contents of the Dao Scripture. Say, if we also use the Dao Scripture as bait, will they kill the people in the Fifth Dimension?"
Second Brother Dao was silent.
Fourth Brother Dao smiled. "Are they more afraid of Ye Xuan or our Dao Sect?"
As he said this, he looked at the old man beside him. "Go and investigate and see if Ye Xuan has any relatives and friends in the Fifth Dimension. Then spread the order. Anyone who kills any of Ye Xuan's relatives and friends will be given the contents of the eighth volume of the Dao Scripture for free. Not only that, but we'll also add one billion Divine Crystals!"
One billion Divine Crystals!
The old man's expression changed.
Fourth Brother Dao smiled. "If Ye Xuan wants to compete with us in terms of wealth and foundation, he's still too young!"
Second Brother Dao smiled. "That's a good plan!"
Fourth Brother Dao said softly, "The forces behind Ye Xuan are too mysterious. We can't fight them head-on for now. We can take it slow and compete with them in terms of foundation and wealth!"
Second Brother Dao said in a deep voice, "This is a good plan, but the forces behind Ye Xuan …"
Fourth Brother Dao said softly, "It's fine, take it slow.
Right now, we want to kill people with a borrowed knife. We want the forces in the Fifth Dimension to target Ye Xuan.
With a great reward, there will be brave people. We want Ye Xuan to become the enemy of the forces in the Fifth Dimension!
As for the white-robed woman and Situ Tingyun behind him, why do we need to find them?
We can wait for them to come to us!
Our top priority now is to get Third Senior Sister back, as well as some of the Elders who are training outside. Get them to come back immediately … Then we'll set up a trap to kill the white-robed woman and Situ Tingyun … and that plain-dressed woman … "
Second Brother Dao said, "I'll go find Third Brother!"
After saying that, he disappeared.
....
Somewhere in the starry sky, Lan Ruo suddenly stopped. After a moment of silence, she looked at Ye Xuan. "The Daoist Faction has issued a notice. Anyone who kills a friend or relative of Ye Xuan will not only be rewarded with the contents of the eighth volume of the Daoist Scripture, but also one billion Divine Crystals!"
Ye Xuan fell silent.
Lan Ruo looked at Ye Xuan. "Do me a favor!"
Lan Ruo said after a moment of silence, "Speak!"
Ye Xuan said with a smile, "Help me issue a wanted order in the name of the Dao Court. Tell them that as long as they can catch my younger sister, Ye Ling, I will not only give them the eighth Taoist Scripture, but also the ninth Taoist Scripture. Not only that, I will give them ten billion Divine Creation Crystals!
No, twenty billion!
Also, all the Daoist Faction's Daoist Scriptures, martial arts, and mental cultivation techniques will be offered … "
Lan Ruo: "…"
....
PS: There are too few tickets. I've thought about it for an entire night, but I still can't figure out what the problem is!
Am I not handsome enough?
....







Chapter 1455
Twenty billion!
Lan Ruo looked at Ye Xuan. "Are you serious?"
Ye Xuan nodded.
Lan Ruo said, "Those people will go crazy!"
Ye Xuan smiled. "I want them to go crazy!"
After a moment of silence, Lan Ruo said, "Alright!"
As she said that, she opened her palm and a talisman suddenly flew out.
Soon, a mysterious wanted order spread throughout the universe.
Ye Ling was wanted!
As long as they could capture Ye Ling, not only would they get the eighth Dao Scripture, but they would also get the ninth Dao Scripture and twenty billion Fortune Divine Crystals …
It was too tempting!
Therefore, many people started to ask about Ye Ling's whereabouts.
With so many powerful and mysterious forces looking for Ye Ling and Ye Ling not deliberately hiding his whereabouts, they found out about Ye Ling's whereabouts in a few hours!
Heavenly Oblivion Starfield!
Countless mysterious experts rushed to Heavenly Oblivion Starfield …
...
In the starry sky.
Ye Xuan and Lan Ruo sped up.
On the way, Lan Ruo suddenly said, "I received news that they have found the whereabouts of my sister, Ye Ling!"
Ye Xuan was a little excited. "Really?"
Lan Ruo looked at Ye Xuan. "Aren't you worried about her?"
Ye Xuan blinked. "Should I be worried?"
Lan Ruo shook her head. "No one would do that to their sister!"
Ye Xuan was speechless.
Lan Ruo continued, "Some people are blinded by greed and will look for their sister, but there are also people who might go to the Fifth Dimension. Aren't you worried about the Fifth Dimension?"
At this point, she suddenly stopped.
The Fifth Dimension!
At this moment, she suddenly thought of something. Was the Fifth Dimension weak?
If it was just the Fifth Dimension, then it was definitely weak.
However, the problem was that it was not just the Fifth Dimension!
The top experts of the Whirling World were basically all in the Fifth Dimension. At present, there were many Consolidation Realm experts in the Fifth Dimension. It was really impossible for ordinary forces to target the Fifth Dimension.
At this time, Ye Xuan took out the map given to him by the white-robed Qing 'er. He glanced at the map and said softly, "We're almost there!"
Lan Ruo scanned her surroundings and soon, she furrowed her brows.
Ye Xuan asked, "What's wrong?"
Lan Ruo said softly, "This is a dead Star Sector!"
Ye Xuan scanned his surroundings. Very quickly, he realized that it was just as Lan Ruo had said. This was a dead Star Sector. There was no sign of life at all!
Ye Xuan asked, "Senior Lan Ruo, do you know of this star domain?"
Lan Ruo shook his head. "I've never been here, nor have I heard of it!"
Ye Xuan was a little surprised. "You don't even know?"
Lan Ruo smiled. "The universe is vast and boundless. It's not something a human can see!"
As she spoke, she looked into the depths of the distant starry sky and said softly, "Actually, this universe is full of dangers, but it's also full of opportunities!"
Ye Xuan nodded. "Indeed!"
As he spoke, he looked into the depths of the starry sky. There was a trace of curiosity and anticipation in his eyes.
What kind of place was this place that Qing 'er wanted him to go to?
...
In the Fifth Dimension.
Currently, the starry sky of the Fifth Dimension was filled with Consolidation Realm experts from the Whirling World!
To guard the Fifth Dimension!
The Whirling Dance School had also sent all their super experts to the Fifth Dimension!
It was obvious that the Whirling Sect was going to stick together with Ye Xuan!
This was normal. After all, the Whirling Sect and the Fifth Dimension were studying the ninth Dao Scripture together. If the Whirling Sect did not put in some effort, how could they?
Although the Whirling Sutra Sect once possessed the ninth volume of the Dao Scripture, they did not completely comprehend it. With their strength, it was practically impossible for them to completely comprehend the ninth volume of the Dao Scripture. However, things were different now!
Because Nian Nian was here!
To be safe, the Whirling Sect had directly sent all their Consolidation Realm experts. There were a total of thirty-six of them!
In addition to the Consolidation Realm experts from other forces in the Whirling World, there were a total of ninety-six Consolidation Realm experts in the Fifth Dimension!
This lineup was actually very terrifying!
And these ninety-six Consolidation Realm experts were guarding the starry sky of the Fifth Dimension. In addition, the Xuanji Sect had set up dozens of super arrays in the sky of the Fifth Dimension!
Right now, the Fifth Dimension was like an iron bucket!
...
Inside the Sword Hall.
Everyone surrounded Nian Nian. Nian Nian was explaining the ninth Dao Scripture word by word.
As for Yue Zun and the others, they listened carefully and recorded.
On the side, Ye Zhiming looked at Nian Nian. She realized that the current Nian Nian was no longer the weak Nian Nian!
She was more like the Fifth Dimension Tendo!
Was she really going to recover her memory?
...
On the other side, Bai Dizi was dealing with the matters of the Fifth Dimension.
Right now, everything in the Fifth Dimension was basically handled by him. As for Guan Yin, Guan Yin would also help, but most of his time was used for cultivation!
At this moment, a man walked in!
White Robe!
At this moment, White Robe had reached the Dao Attainment Realm!
Bai Dizi looked at White Robe. "How many people in the White Robe Army have reached the Dao Attainment Realm?"
White Robe said, "Three hundred and sixty!"
Three hundred and sixty!
Bai Dizi suddenly pointed with a finger and a storage ring landed in front of White Robe. "There is a bottle of pills in it. Yes, it is called Dao God Pills. It can help you break through to the Consolidation Realm. There are ten of them. Take one for yourself and give the rest as you see fit.
Other than that, there are some pills that can increase cultivation level for the White Robe Army. "
White Robe glanced at Bai Dizi. "He gave them to you?"
Bai Dizi nodded.
White Robe was silent.
Bai Dizi walked in front of White Robe and looked at him. "His footsteps are too fast. If we can't keep up, we will be left behind. Do you understand what I mean?"
White Robe nodded.
White Robe said softly, "Right now, the two strongest armies in our Five-Dimensional Universe are the White Robe Army and the Sword Sect's Swordsman. He has already instructed us to nurture you at all costs."
White Robe was silent.
Bai Dizi looked outside the hall with a complicated expression. "White Robe, what was our dream back then?
It was to rebuild order!
And he is really doing this!
Although he is very young and a bit willful, he really wants to make this world a better place! "
White Robe picked up the pills and left.
When he reached the door, he suddenly stopped. "I fight for my beliefs. If he needs me, I can risk my life at any time!"
After saying this, he walked out of the hall.
Inside the hall, Bai Dizi was silent.
At this moment, a middle-aged man appeared in front of Bai Dizi.
This person was Zhenwu!
In fact, he had been back for some time!
Bai Dizi said, "How is the investigation going?"
Zhenwu said in a deep voice, "The Dao Sect is targeting us. They have issued a wanted order. Anyone who kills a friend or relative of the Dao Master can obtain the contents of the eighth volume of the Dao Scripture.
And now, some mysterious experts have appeared in the Five-Dimensional Universe. The weakest of them is at the Consolidation Realm! "
Bai Dizi narrowed his eyes. "The Dao Sect!"
Zhenwu nodded. "I also know that they have begun to gather all the experts outside. They might be making a big move!"
Bai Dizi was silent.
Zhenwu looked at Bai Dizi. "What do you think?"
Bai Dizi said softly, "The Dao Master said he has something to do and needs to leave the Five-Dimensional Universe for a period of time … I think he definitely needs time right now. So, we have to fight for some time for him!"
Zhenwu asked, "How?"
After a moment of silence, Bai Dizi said, "The Dao Sect doesn't dare to make a move because they are afraid of the forces behind the Dao Master. In other words, Miss Tingyun and the white-robed woman have released the news.
They will say that the Dao Master has gone to find Miss Tingyun and the white-robed woman … This way, the forces in the dark will be afraid. As for the Dao Sect, if they want to make a move, they must consider Miss Tingyun and the white-robed woman. As long as they consider Miss Tingyun and the white-robed woman, they won't dare to make a move easily! "
Zhenwu nodded. "Okay!"
Bai Dizi said again, "One more thing. Contact Xuan City, the Gu Race, and the Nanyue Race. Tell them that we have invited them to the Five-Dimensional Universe as guests and that we will study the first to eighth volume of the Dao Scriptures together!"
Zhenwu hesitated for a moment and said, "Will they come?"
Bai Dizi said, "If I were them, I wouldn't refuse!
They need to kill one of us to obtain the contents of the eighth volume. But now, we don't need anything and will give it to them for free!
In any case, the contents of the first to eighth volume have already been leaked. Since that's the case, why don't we be more straightforward? "
Zhenwu spoke in a low voice, "I'll get it done right now!"
As soon as he finished speaking, he turned around and left.
Within the hall. Bai Dizi closed his eyes slowly ….
He was very worried at this moment.
The Dao Sect dared to target Ye Xuan even though they knew how formidable the white-robed woman and Situ Tingyun were. Obviously, the Dao Sect was confident!
Such an ancient power definitely had extremely deep resources and reserves!
...
The Dao Sect.
Fourth Dao looked at an old man in front of him. "You're saying that Ye Xuan has gone to look for the white-robed woman and Situ Tingyun?"
The old man nodded. "That's the information I received!"
Fourth Dao fell silent.
The old man continued, "Besides that, I don't know who used the Dao Sect's name to issue an arrest warrant for Ye Xuan's younger sister. Anyone who captures Ye Xuan's younger sister won't just be rewarded with the eighth and ninth volumes of the Dao Scriptures, there will also be 20 billion Divine Fortune Crystals!"
Fourth Dao said, "Did you find out who it was?"
The old man shook his head. "I couldn't!"
Fourth Dao chuckled. "Forget it!
It's not a bad thing for us anyway! "
The old man nodded. "Some people have gone to the Sky Oblivion Planet Zone to look for Ye Ling … I guess someone has already found her!"
Fourth Dao smiled. Then, as if he had thought of something, his pupils suddenly contracted. "Oh no!
Someone purposely sent those people to look for Ye Ling, and there's a powerful soul in Ye Ling's body … Someone not only wants to divert the trouble, but also wants to frame our Dao Sect! "
The old man: "…"
Fourth Dao narrowed his eyes. "Who's so sinister?!"
...
Sky Oblivion Planet Zone.
Ye Ling stopped in front of a city gate because there was an old man standing not far from her.
The old man was shrouded in a black robe, so his face couldn't be seen.
The black-robed old man said hoarsely, "Are you Ye Xuan's younger sister?"
Ye Ling's face was expressionless. "Yes!"
The black-robed old man said, "I want to borrow something from you!"
Ye Ling looked at the black-robed old man. "What?"
The black-robed old man said, "A human head!"
As soon as he finished speaking, he suddenly disappeared on the spot.
An extremely strange scene appeared. When the black-robed old man charged at Ye Ling, his body was already in front of Ye Ling, but his head had fallen dozens of feet behind him!
The black-robed old man's eyes were wide open, and his eyes were filled with disbelief.
He died with everlasting regret!
Ye Ling suddenly turned her head. The next moment, she suddenly grabbed with her right hand. The space was torn apart, and her right hand directly grabbed a black-robed man.
The black-robed man said in a trembling voice, "Senior …"
Ye Ling's face was expressionless. "Who told you to come to me?!"
The black-robed man said in horror, "It's … Dao Sect. They said that if we kill Ye Xuan's younger sister, we can get the eighth and ninth Dao Scriptures, as well as 20 billion Fortune Divine Crystals …"
Ye Ling's expression was somewhat ferocious. "You only know how to bully their younger sister. Are you done?
Take me to Dao Sect! "
The black-robed man: "…"
...







Chapter 1456
To Dao Sect!
Ye Ling was not joking. Under the lead of the black-clothed man, she went straight to Dao Sect!
After walking for a while, three black-robed men suddenly appeared not far in front of her.
One of them said, "It's …"
Ye Ling suddenly slapped out.
Boom!
The person who spoke immediately exploded!
His soul was destroyed!
The remaining two were petrified in place!
At this time, Ye Ling gently stomped her right foot on the ground, and a dim light flew out. In an instant, the remaining two experts were directly erased by this dim light.
Beside Ye Ling, the black-clothed man's body began to tremble.
What kind of monster was this?
Dao Sect!
At this moment, the black-clothed man wished he could eat Dao Sect alive. Wasn't this Dao Sect cheating?
On the way to Dao Sect, Ye Ling killed more than a dozen Consolidation Realm experts!
All of them were instant kills!
It was like killing a chicken!
The black-clothed man beside Ye Ling had turned from fear to terror!
Since when did Consolidation Realm experts become so weak?
Was this senior in front of him too strong, or was he too weak?
At this moment, the black-clothed man was confused!
He had cultivated all his life and thought that he had reached the top of this world, but suddenly found that killing him was as easy as killing a chicken …
Ye Xuan!
At this moment, he thought of Ye Xuan!
He thought of what Ye Xuan had said!
The son of the Nine-Dimensional Plane!
This guy might really be the son of the Nine-Dimensional Plane!
...
Along the way, Ye Ling's expression was cold.
Angry!
Extremely angry!
She was actually very busy, because she had a lot of things to do.
However, people kept coming to make trouble for her!
What made her most disgusted was that these people wanted to capture Ye Ling to threaten Ye Xuan!
If they had a grudge against Ye Xuan, they could have just looked for Ye Xuan!
Looking for his sister?
Don't they know that his sister is the one I chose?
...
Dao Sect!
Dao Sect was located in the Dao Domain, which used to be a holy land in the hearts of the world's cultivators!
Because this was the origin of martial arts.
Dao scriptures!
All the cultivation methods in the universe, including all the divine abilities and innate martial arts, originated from the Daoist scriptures!
Although the Daoist Gate was not as powerful as it was in the past, it was still the number one force in the universe.
In the outside world, Consolidation Realm experts were as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns, but in this place, Consolidation Realm experts were nothing.
On this day, a woman and a man in black arrived at the Dao Domain.
The woman was none other than Ye Ling!
The black-clothed man beside Ye Ling said in a trembling voice, "Senior, we've reached the Dao Domain!"
Ye Ling looked at the black-clothed man, and the black-clothed man said with a trembling voice, "Please spare my life, Senior!"
Ye Ling was expressionless. "Scram!"
The black-clothed man turned and ran!
Ye Ling looked into the distance and stomped her right foot.
Boom!
The entire Dao Domain trembled violently. The starry sky trembled and cracked, and the ground collapsed!
All the Dao Domain experts were alarmed!
Who was it?
At this time, a middle-aged man appeared in front of Ye Ling.
The man was Dao Brother Four!
Dao Brother Four looked at Ye Ling. "It's Ye Xuan's sister, Ye Ling!"
Ye Ling was expressionless. In the next moment, she slapped him.
In the distance, Dao Brother Four's pupils suddenly shrank, and he punched out!
Dao Fist!
With this punch, the starry sky in front of him immediately became illusory. At the same time, a gust of
At the same time, a powerful force that could destroy heaven and earth swept towards Ye Ling. However, before the force of this punch could get close to Ye Ling, it disappeared without a trace!
Not only that, but Dao Brother Four instantly retreated tens of thousands of feet away!
Seeing this scene, the expressions of the surrounding Daoist Gate experts changed!
In this confrontation, Dao Brother Four was at a disadvantage?
Ye Ling walked towards Dao Brother Four. "Aren't you looking for his sister?
I'm here now! "
Dao Brother Four looked at Ye Ling with an extremely solemn expression.
Ye Ling suddenly punched out!
Dao Brother Four's pupils suddenly shrank, and he blocked with his arm.
Boom!
The space where Dao Brother Four was directly shattered, and Dao Brother Four himself retreated tens of thousands of feet away!
However, he did not die. He was only injured because he had also cultivated a Daoist Body!
Moreover, he had cultivated a Daoist Body to the Consolidation Realm!
Dao Brother Four looked at Ye Ling, and he slowly clenched his right hand. In the next moment, he suddenly leaped up, and then he clenched his right hand tightly, and a flame gushed out from the palm of his hand!
Fen Tian Jue!
Dao Brother Four suddenly slapped his palm down towards Ye Ling!
Boom!
A giant flaming palm swept down from the starry sky, and wherever the palm passed, the space was annihilated inch by inch. It was extremely terrifying!
In the distance, Ye Ling was expressionless. She opened her palm, and a dim light shot up into the sky.
Under everyone's gaze, the dim light directly shattered Dao Brother Four's palm. In the next moment, the dim light shot straight towards Dao Brother Four!
In the sky, Dao Brother Four's pupils suddenly shrank, and he suddenly blocked with his arms.
Boom!
Dao Brother Four instantly retreated tens of thousands of feet, and when he stopped, his physical body directly cracked!
Ye Ling's attack directly cracked his physical body!
In the distance, Ye Ling glanced at her right hand. Her right hand had already cracked!
Ye Ling shook her head. "Ling 'er, this physical body is too weak!
It can't even withstand 10% of my strength!
However, it's enough! "
As she spoke, she looked at Dao Brother Four in the distance, and in the next moment, she directly slapped him!
Slap!
With a crisp slap, Dao Brother Four was directly sent flying, and this time, he flew for tens of thousands of feet!
After slapping Dao Brother Four, Ye Ling did not stop. She directly disappeared on the spot, and when she reappeared, she was already in front of Dao Brother Four. Dao Brother Four's expression changed greatly. He was about to attack again, but Ye Ling suddenly slapped him again.
Slap!
A dim light directly slapped Dao Brother Four's face.
Boom!
Dao Brother Four was blasted flying again. Moreover, his Dao Body directly cracked open, and blood sprayed out.
Ye Ling gazed at Dao Brother Four who was blasted flying, and she was about to attack again. Meanwhile, over a dozen formidable auras swept over from behind her!
Ye Ling suddenly turned around and suddenly smashed her fist forward!
Bang!
At this moment, the starry sky in an area of over 100km in front of Ye Ling collapsed, and those extraordinary experts from the Daoist Sect were directly wiped out!
Ye Ling turned around to look at Dao Brother Four. She was just about to attack, but she frowned when she clenched her right hand. She looked at her right hand, and her right hand was covered in cracks!
Ye Ling remained silent.
This physical body was quite weak, and it was utterly unable to withstand too much of her strength!
Meanwhile, Dao Brother Four suddenly spoke ferociously, "Who the hell is it!?"
Ye Ling looked at Dao Brother Four, and in the next moment, she directly vanished on the spot. In the distance, Dao Brother Four's pupils constricted, and he was just about to attack when a hand had clamped down on his throat.
It was Ye Ling's hand!
At the same time, a ray of dim light enveloped Dao Brother Four!
The dim light forcefully suppressed all of Dao Brother Four's strength!
Ye Ling gazed at Dao Brother Four with an icy cold expression, "Does the enmity between Ye Xuan and the Daoist Sect have anything to do with his younger sister?
Does it? "
As she spoke, she suddenly clenched her fist.
Bang!
Dao Brother Four's body collapsed, but his soul transformed into a wisp of green smoke that drifted 30km away!
Dao Brother Four stared fixedly at Ye Ling, "Sacrifice the formation!"
As soon as he spoke, a ray of black light suddenly shot into the sky from the depths of the Dao Domain. As soon as the ray of white light appeared, strange and mysterious talismans suddenly appeared around Ye Ling, and the ray of white light directly locked onto Ye Ling!
Ye Ling smashed her fist forward!
A ray of dim light instantly swept through the starry sky!
Bang!
The mysterious talismans were obliterated inch by inch!
At this moment, streams of light suddenly erupted from the ray of white light, and these streams of light were like shooting stars that drowned Ye Ling.
Below, Ye Ling was about to attack when she suddenly frowned. Because at this moment, her face had turned slightly pale!
Her physical body was unable to support her any further attacks!
Ye Ling fell silent for a moment, and then she smashed her right fist forward!
Bang!
Those streams of light collapsed inch by inch, and the white light array was also shattered by her punch in an instant!
Ye Ling didn't attack again. She looked at Dao Brother Four, "If you dare to cause trouble for his younger sister again, I'll destroy the Daoist Sect."
As soon as she finished speaking, she turned around and left.
Actually, she could destroy the Daoist Sect now, but the price she would pay would be huge!
Because Ye Ling's physical body couldn't bear it!
Dao Brother Four's expression was extremely gloomy when he saw Ye Ling turn around and leave.
Humiliation!
This woman came to the Daoist Sect to kill someone, shattered his Daoist body, and then left swiftly!
The Daoist Sect had never suffered such humiliation!
However, there was nothing he could do!
With his own strength, he couldn't do anything to this woman at all!
And the Consolidation Realm experts of the Daoist Sect were probably not enough in front of this woman!
He could only watch as the woman left!
Of course, at this moment, he was still thinking about a question. How strong was this woman?
He could clearly feel that this woman hadn't displayed her full strength!
At this moment, Ye Ling suddenly stopped in the distance. Seeing this scene, Dao Brother Four's expression changed!
What was this woman trying to do?
After Ye Ling stopped, she turned to look at Dao Brother Four, "He still has a younger sister. If you really want to take revenge on him, you can go find his other sister!
That sister likes to wear a plain dress, and the world calls her Tianming. You can go find her!
Really! "
Dao Brother Four looked at Ye Ling, "What do you mean?"
Ye Ling said, "Don't you like to find his younger sister?
I'll introduce you to his younger sister!
That sister is weaker, you can go find her! "
Dao Brother Four narrowed his eyes, "Are you saying that the woman in the plain dress is weaker?"
Ye Ling nodded, "Among all the people behind him, Tianming is the weakest!"
Dao Brother Four looked at Ye Ling, "Why are you telling us this!"
Ye Ling was expressionless, "Because I don't like that woman!"
After saying that, she turned and left.
Dao Brother Four suddenly asked, "Is that Tianming really the weakest?"
Ye Ling turned to look at Dao Brother Four, "Do you think I'm above lying?"
After saying that, she turned into a dim light and disappeared at the end of the sky.
Dao Brother Four was silent.
Tianming!
The weakest among all the people behind Ye Xuan!
At this time, an old man appeared beside Dao Brother Four, the old man said in a deep voice, "This woman's words …"
Dao Brother Four looked at the dim light in the distant sky and said softly, "Such a strong person must not be above lying because she has her pride, so I believe what she said!
Perhaps, that woman in the plain dress is our breakthrough … "
.....
PS: It's not very useful to ask for votes!
Can anyone help?







Chapter 1457
News of the Fourth Dao Brother being heavily injured by Ye Ling hadn't spread!
The Daoist Faction had sealed off the entire Dao Domain, so outsiders didn't know that the Fourth Dao Brother's body had been destroyed.
However, there was no such thing as an impenetrable wall.
...
The Boundless Hallowed Grounds.
The Hallowed Lord arrived before the bamboo house once more, and he bowed respectfully towards it, "Master, Ye Ling has gone to the Dao World, and the Fourth Dao Brother's body has been destroyed!"
The woman stopped reading, and she fell silent for a moment before she shook her head and smiled, "Why did the Daoist Faction offend her?
Aren't they courting death? "
The Hallowed Lord hesitated for a moment and said, "Master said that there's a formidable soul within Ye Ling's body. Master, how strong is that soul?"
The woman chuckled, "It's very strong. It's someone who once shocked an entire era."
Very strong!
The Hallowed Lord fell silent.
Meanwhile, an ancient scroll floated into the bamboo house.
The Hallowed Lord gazed at the bamboo house, "Master, what's this?"
The woman said, "Ye Xuan once saved the Jia Long Clan in the Dark Dimension. Even though that woman in a plain dress forcefully stopped that karma, but …."
When she spoke up to this point, she grinned, "I think that Martial Emperor won't let it go just like that!"
The Hallowed Lord spoke in a low voice, "Master, you intend to use that Martial Emperor to kill Ye Xuan?"
The woman shook her head and smiled, "That's not right. This enmity is between him and that Martial Emperor, so what does it have to do with us?
There's a mental cultivation technique within the scroll, and it can help Martial Emperors break through the final barrier. I believe that if he takes that final step, then he probably won't be so afraid of that woman! "
The Hallowed Lord hesitated for a moment and said, "Master, what are our chances of killing Ye Xuan if we make a move?"
The woman's gaze descended onto the scroll, and she grinned with confidence, "100%!"
100%!
The Hallowed Lord was stunned, and he was about to speak when the woman smiled, "So long as those three swords don't make a move, then I'm 100% confident in killing him!"
The Hallowed Lord asked, "Even if the white robed woman and Situ Tingyun are here?"
The Hallowed Lord turned around and smiled, "Do you think I'm bragging?"
The Saint Master hurriedly shook his head. "No!"
The woman picked up the ancient book and walked out of the bamboo house. Today, she was wearing a dark green dress with mountains and rivers painted on it. She looked very quiet and elegant.
The woman looked at the horizon and said with a light smile, "It's actually very simple to kill him!
However, what would happen after killing him?
Killing him was tantamount to poking a hornet's nest.
Not to mention anything else, that plain-dressed woman will definitely kill me at all costs … I really can't beat that woman! "
As she spoke, she shook her head helplessly.
The Hallowed Lord hesitated for a moment before he said, "Master, are you unable to resist that woman even with your strength?"
The woman retracted her gaze and walked in front of the Sacred Leader. The Sacred Leader hurriedly bowed, not daring to look at the woman directly.
The woman held the ancient book and gently patted the Holy Lord's head. "Remember, that woman is invincible!
As long as she didn't want to die, no one in this world could kill her.
The only way to defeat her was to start with Ye Xuan, because Ye Xuan was her only weakness.
Other than that, there was no other way to defeat her.
Even if everyone in this universe joined forces, we might not be able to block a single strike of her sword. "
As she spoke, she looked at the horizon and sighed. "Actually, I don't want to be her enemy either.
But there's no other way. I really want to kill this Ye Xuan! "
The Sacred Leader said in a low voice, "Master, there's something I don't understand. Since that plain-dressed woman is already so strong, then why is she still wandering aimlessly in space?
Is she doing this to temper Ye Xuan? "
The woman shook her head and smiled. "She isn't wandering aimlessly!
She's too weak to see that countless Causes of Karma have already coiled around her … She's looking for the source of the Cause of Misfortune, the person who controls Ye Xuan's fate. "
The Sacred Leader frowned slightly. "The person who controls Ye Xuan's fate?"
The woman nodded. "The Cause of Misfortune!
Everyone in the world doesn't really understand the Cause of Misfortune!
This world is divided into Yin and Yang, good and evil!
If there's a Cause of Misfortune, then there's a Cause of Misfortune!
And this Cause of Misfortune is the head of all Causes of Misfortune … A person with a Cause of Good is equivalent to having great luck. He's protected by Heaven and Earth, protected by Fate, and protected by the Great Dao.
This kind of person's life is like cheating, because whatever he does, there will be a Cause of Good.
On the contrary, a person with a Cause of Misfortune will have a rough life with all sorts of troubles. Like a malefic star, even if he does a good thing, there might be a Cause of Misfortune. Not only that, anyone who is related to him will not have a good ending. "
As she spoke to this point, she paused and said, "The reason why Ye Xuan is able to live until now is because of that woman and that man who changed his fate. Especially that plain-dressed woman, she forcefully shouldered countless Karma of Misfortune for Ye Xuan.
But she realized that these Karma seemed endless. No matter how she shouldered it, there would be countless Karma that would come to bother Ye Xuan. So, she decided to find the Cause of Misfortune. "
The Sacred Leader asked, "And after finding it?"
The woman smiled. "Of course, she'll kill it!"
The Sacred Leader: "…"
The woman suddenly said softly, "Actually, Ye Xuan is quite pitiful!
Don't think that he has many backers, if you look closely, you will realize that his enemies are not at his level at all. They are all several levels higher than him … No matter how hard he tries to become stronger, his enemies will always be stronger than him by at least a few levels! "
As she spoke to this point, she pointed at herself and smiled. "For example, me!"
The Sacred Leader: "…"
The woman continued, "Actually, I think the reason why he has a Cause of Misfortune might be related to his father and his sister!"
The Sacred Leader was a little confused. "His father and sister?"
The woman nodded. "A person cannot have a Cause of Misfortune for no reason!
He was born with a Cause of Misfortune. Apart from himself, there is another reason, and that is his family … "
The Sacred Leader frowned slightly. "His family?"
The woman looked up at the sky and said softly, "His sister is invincible in the world. No Karma can touch her. Even the Cause of Misfortune can't touch her!
As for his father, he also severed his past and present lives with one sword strike. No Karma can touch him … "
The Sacred Leader said softly, "So, this Cause of Misfortune has fallen on Ye Xuan?
But that shouldn't be the case!
Or could it be that his father and sister used to … "
The woman looked at the Sacred Leader and smiled. "The number of people that his sister used to kill is unimaginable!
As for his father … looking at Ye Xuan's bloodline, you should know that his father is not a good person!
Although his temper has changed a lot over the years, he used to be called a lunatic! "
As she spoke to this point, there was a trace of indescribable color in her eyes.
The Sacred Leader: "…
...”
The woman continued, "Of course, things are definitely not that simple!
There is something wrong with Ye Xuan himself … In short, this Cause of Misfortune is definitely related to his father and sister!
If we want to kill Ye Xuan, the best way is to make use of the Cause of Misfortune. Only then will we have a chance! "
As she spoke, she looked at the Sacred Leader. "Go to the Ultimate Martial Realm personally. Remember, don't let that Martial Emperor know that it was given to him by the Sacred Ground … Forget it!
I'll go personally!
With my strength, I'm afraid I won't be able to hide it from that Martial Emperor! "
As she spoke, she took the ancient scroll in the Sacred Leader's hand and disappeared on the spot.
...
Somewhere in the starry sky, Ye Xuan suddenly stopped and looked around. The starry sky was quiet and the stars were dim.
Lan Ruo looked around with a calm expression.
This place was not simple!
However, with her strength, there were not many in this world who could kill her!
Ye Xuan took out the map that the white-robed Qing 'er gave him and looked at it. Then, he looked around and said softly, "The map shows this Star Domain. However, there seems to be nothing here!"
Lan Ruo said, "Let me take a look!"
Ye Xuan passed the map to Lan Ruo. Lan Ruo looked at it. After a while, she looked to the right and opened her palm. A mysterious force rippled out and the starry sky around them started to tremble. After a while, a huge stone door appeared on their right!
Ye Xuan looked at the stone door. Behind the stone door was a long bluestone staircase that was tens of thousands of feet long. At the end of the staircase was a huge palace that floated in the starry sky.
Ye Xuan looked at Lan Ruo. Lan Ruo shook her head. "I've never seen it before!"
Ye Xuan said, "Let's go take a look!"
Lan Ruo nodded.
The two of them walked towards the stone door. When they reached it, Ye Xuan raised his head and looked at the stone door. The stone door was a little old. It was obvious that it had been here for some time.
The two of them continued walking along the stone stairs.
Along the way, Ye Xuan suddenly said softly, "Qing 'er must have been here before!"
Lan Ruo looked around and there was a hint of seriousness in her eyes. "This place is a world of its own. It's part of the starry sky, but it's outside of this starry sky … It looks like this place isn't as simple as it seems!"
Ye Xuan asked, "Is there any danger?"
Lan Ruo shook her head and smiled. "Not yet!
Since that senior allowed us to come here, it's obvious that there won't be any danger. However, we still have to be careful! "
Ye Xuan nodded.
He didn't dare to be careless when it came to unknown places like these!
Lan Ruo looked at the palace in the distance and secretly raised her guard.
Although she was powerful, it was important to know that there would always be someone better than her. It was always good to be careful!
Soon, the two of them arrived in front of the palace. Ye Xuan looked at the top of the palace. There were three big words on the top of the palace: Milky Way Sect.
Milky Way Sect?
Just as Ye Xuan was about to speak, Lan Ruo frowned slightly. At the same time, the sound of footsteps could be heard from within the palace.
Ye Xuan's heart skipped a beat. He looked into the palace and was stunned for a moment. Then, he exclaimed in shock, "Holy shit, it's!
It's actually … "
Lan Ruo was speechless.
....







Chapter 1458
The reason why Ye Xuan was so shocked and surprised was that he knew the person in front of him!
It was a woman in front of him!
And this woman was none other than Number Nine, who had been with him before!
The Number Nine who needed to be recharged!
There was no news of this woman after she left!
And now, she was actually here!
Seeing Ye Xuan, Number Nine was also a little surprised. She blinked and said, "Yes!"
Ye Xuan took a look at Number Nine and realized that she seemed to have become stronger!
How did this guy cultivate?
At this moment, Number Nine suddenly smiled and said, "Why are you here?"
It was obvious that she was also very happy to see Ye Xuan.
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "A friend asked me to come!
By the way, why is Number Nine here? "
Number Nine said, "This is our base!"
Ye Xuan blinked and said, "Base?"
Number Nine nodded and said, "Yes!"
Ye Xuan asked, "The Milky Way Sect … is from the Milky Way Realm?"
Number Nine smiled and said, "Yes."
Ye Xuan was silent.
He didn't expect Number Nine to be from the Milky Way Realm.
He didn't know much about the Milky Way Realm. He only knew that Erya and the little white guy seemed to have been to this place!
The former prophet had also been to this place!
Number Nine suddenly smiled and said, "Come with me, I'll give you a super treasure!"
With that, she took Ye Xuan's hand and walked toward the main hall.
Ye Xuan was speechless.
Lan Ruo looked at Number Nine with a serious expression.
Because this Number Nine made her feel a hint of danger!
Most importantly, this Number Nine's aura was completely absent, as if it didn't exist!
It was a little strange!
Number Nine brought Ye Xuan to the main hall. In the main hall, he saw many strange things that he had never seen before.
Lan Ruo was also looking around curiously. She had never seen these things before!
At this moment, Ye Xuan suddenly stopped and pointed to a strange big thing on the right. "Number Nine, what is this?"
Number Nine took a look at that strangely shaped big thing and said with a smile, "This is a space-time starship. It can travel through space-time tunnels and perform space jumps. It is currently the fastest known flying mount!"
Lan Ruo suddenly asked, "The fastest?"
Number 9 nodded. "Yes!
Because the speed of this object has already surpassed the speed of light by two times! "
Ye Xuan blinked. "Light speed?"
Number 9 thought for a moment, and then he said, "Do you not know what the speed of light is?"
Ye Xuan asked, "Is this the speed of light?"
Number 9 nodded. "Yes!"
Ye Xuan was silent. He really had no concept of this!
Number Nine led Ye Xuan towards the depths of the main hall. Along the way, there were some strange things everywhere.
In next to no time, Number 9 led Ye Xuan to a secret chamber. A stone platform was placed within the secret chamber, and a sword was stabbed into the stone platform!
Sword!
The sword was four feet long, slightly longer than the average sword. One side of the sword was white, while the other side was black. It looked quite strange.
Ye Xuan looked at Number 9. "What's this?"
Number 9 smiled. "Unparalleled!"
Ye Xuan was a little puzzled. "Unparalleled sword?"
Number 9 nodded. "In our place, this sword is supreme and unsurpassed."
Ye Xuan blinked. "It's that powerful?"
Number 9 said seriously, "It's very powerful!
This sword is a combination of great dao and technology. It's very terrifying! "
Ye Xuan was a little puzzled. "Technology?"
Number 9 said, "A technological civilization!"
Ye Xuan was even more puzzled. "A technological civilization?"
Number 9 nodded. "Your civilization is a martial arts civilization, while ours is a technological civilization!
Some places have biological civilizations … and this sword is forged from the advantages of a martial arts civilization and a technological civilization!
Give it a try! "
Ye Xuan hesitated for a moment, and then he asked, "Is a technological civilization powerful?"
Number 9 blinked. "Any civilization is powerful."
Lan Ruo suddenly asked, "What's the difference between a technological civilization and a martial arts civilization?"
Number 9 thought for a moment, and then he said, "Actually, there's no difference in essence!
The only difference is that your civilization cultivates itself, unearths its own potential, and allows itself to continuously grow and evolve. As for us, we create, constantly create … However, we're also learning from your civilization, because in many aspects, your martial arts civilization is even more terrifying than our technological civilization. "
Ye Xuan and Lan Ruo looked at each other, and there was a hint of astonishment in their eyes!
At this moment, Number 9 said, "Try this sword!"
Ye Xuan nodded. He opened his palm, and the sword flew into his hand. It was cold to the touch, and as light as a feather.
Ye Xuan looked at Number 9, and Number 9 smiled. "This sword has two modes. The first is a martial arts mode. If this mode is activated, this sword will amplify the owner's martial arts techniques by about 50%.
The second mode … "
At this moment, Ye Xuan suddenly interrupted Number 9. "30% to 50%?"
Number 9 nodded. "Yes!"
Ye Xuan said, "Can I try it?"
Number 9 smiled. "Of course!"
Ye Xuan held the sword in his hand while the profound energy within his body circulated. At the instant he circulated his profound energy, the sword trembled violently. In the next moment, he noticed that the speed at which his profound energy circulated had increased greatly, and it had increased by at least 50%!
Ye Xuan gazed at the sword in his hand with slight astonishment. A moment later, he opened his palm, and the sword suddenly flew out.
A strand of sword light suddenly tore through space and appeared in the starry sky 3km away from the hall!
Lan Ruo's eyes narrowed slightly, and a trace of seriousness flashed through the depths of her eyes!
This sword strike was able to threaten her!
Especially when it caught her off guard. This sword strike had a 30% chance of killing her!
What did that mean?
After all, she was more than 2 realms higher than Ye Xuan!
This sword strike was too terrifying!
Ye Xuan was quite shocked as well. Because he noticed that the might of his sword strike had really increased by at least 50%!
Its speed hadn't increased, but its might had increased!
This increase was quite terrifying!
Meanwhile, Number 9 spoke abruptly, "This sword technique hasn't been cultivated to its limits!"
Ye Xuan gazed at Number 9. Number 9 said, "If one cultivates this sword technique to its limits, then it won't be able to increase its strength. Because it can't increase the upper limit of a sword technique. The reason it can increase its strength is because it hasn't been cultivated to its limits!
Now, one can rely on this Swordsman to cultivate it to its limits. "
Ye Xuan spoke softly, "In that case, not only will one not rely on this sword, but one can even use it as a mirror to find out where one is lacking and cultivate from there?"
Number 9 nodded. "Yes!
That's the designer's original intention!
The designer didn't design this sword so that one could rely on it. Instead, he wanted one to use it to find out where one is lacking and change! "
Ye Xuan smiled, "That's a good sword!"
Number 9 smiled, "It's not just a sword technique. This sword can be used as a medium to execute any divine ability or martial technique!"
Ye Xuan gazed at Number 9 and said, "What's the second form?"
Number 9 gazed at the sword in Ye Xuan's hand and said, "Form change!"
The sword trembled slightly, and the space around it trembled slightly.
Number 9 gazed at Ye Xuan and said, "The second form is Technological Mode. There are two types of attributes in this mode. The first is strength, and the second is speed!"
Ye Xuan blinked and said, "Speed?"
Number 9 nodded and said, "It can increase one's speed to its limits!"
Ye Xuan opened his palm. In the next moment, a sword suddenly appeared in space 3km away from the hall. After the sword appeared for around a breath of time, the space behind the sword split apart ….
Ye Xuan remained silent within the secret chamber.
Extreme speed!
He had executed the Instakill Sword, and the speed of the Instakill Sword was at least twice as fast as his original speed!
Although the speed of this sword wasn't as fast as Situ Tingyun's Instakill, it was already quite close!
Not to mention the surprise attack, even a Consolidation Realm expert would not be able to withstand it even if it was executed openly.
Lan Ruo was silent.
At this moment, her expression was solemn.
If Ye Xuan's sword had caught her off guard, there was at least a 50% chance that it could kill her!
Of course, if she was prepared, it was basically impossible for this sword to kill her instantly!
However, this Instakill was a sneak attack!
Who would fight against it openly?
Ye Xuan wouldn't be so stupid as to shout, "Watch my Instakill Sword …" when he executed this sword technique.
If this sword skill was used stealthily, the threat it posed would be too great!
Ye Xuan looked at the sword in his hand and slowly closed his eyes. At this moment, he activated his physical strength!
The sword started to tremble!
The space around it started to crack!
Ye Xuan hurriedly stopped when he saw this.
No.9 said, "This sword can increase one's strength by at least two times. However, there's a flaw as well. Regardless of whether it's increasing speed or strength, there's a certain side effect. Because one doesn't possess such speed or strength, so increasing speed or strength is equivalent to overdrafting one's body. So, one might be extremely exhausted after executing it!"
Ye Xuan nodded. He'd felt slightly exhausted after executing Instakill just now. Because he'd relied on this sword to increase the speed of Instakill to the limits of what his body could endure!
Actually, the most terrifying aspect of this sword wasn't its ability to increase sword technique, speed, or strength, but its ability to tell one how much room for growth there was!
For example, this Instant Kill Sword. This sword was telling him that he could do even better!
That was the most terrifying aspect of it!
If Situ Tingyun were to use this sword to execute Instakill, then there probably wouldn't be much improvement because she'd already done it to the limit!
Meanwhile, No.9 smiled, "Do you like this sword?"
Ye Xuan looked at No.9, "Are you really going to give it to me?"
No.9 rolled his eyes at Ye Xuan, "Of course!"
Ye Xuan was slightly puzzled, "Why?"
No.9 blinked, "What do you mean why?"
Ye Xuan asked, "Why are you giving it to me?"
No.9 said, "We're on the same side!"
Ye Xuan was stunned, "We're on the same side?"
No.9 nodded, "Yes!
We're on the same side! "
Ye Xuan was slightly puzzled, "Why am I on the same side as you?"
No.9 said, "Because the Milky Way Sect is my home!"
My home?
Ye Xuan was dumbfounded. What the hell?
....
PS: I miss the times when I was single. I could update 5 or 6 chapters a day …. No matter if it's my writing speed or writing time, I was invincible!
Moreover, I even had time to go to a spa!







Chapter 1459
My family?
Needless to say, Ye Xuan was really confused!
He was sure that he had nothing to do with the Milky Way Realm!
He had never been to the Milky Way Realm!
And this Number 9 actually said that the Milky Way Sect was his family!
Not to mention Ye Xuan, even Lan Ruo was shocked!
This Milky Way Sect was not a simple force!
And this Young Master Ye was actually related to the Milky Way Realm?
Seeing how shocked Ye Xuan was, Number 9 was puzzled. "You don't know?"
Ye Xuan smiled bitterly. "Number 9, I don't know anything!
I've never been to the Milky Way Realm! "
Number 9 pondered for a moment, then said, "It doesn't matter. Anyway, your bloodline is the right one!"
Ye Xuan was puzzled. "Bloodline is the right one?"
Number 9 nodded. "Your bloodline!"
Ye Xuan had a strange expression. Could this Milky Way Sect have been founded by that cheapskate dad of his?
As if thinking of something, Ye Xuan suddenly asked, "Number 9, the first time I met you, you wanted to destroy humanity …"
Number 9 blinked. "There was a programming error, but it has been fixed!"
Ye Xuan was confused. "Programming error?"
Number 9 thought for a moment, then said, "Just like how you went insane!
Because I've been drifting in space for too long, plus I haven't been able to recharge, there's something wrong with my brain!
I've activated anti-human mode! "
Anti-human mode!
Ye Xuan was speechless.
Lan Ruo suddenly said, "Miss Number 9, what are you doing here?"
Ye Xuan looked at Number 9. He was very curious as well.
Number 9 said, "Waiting for someone!"
Lan Ruo glanced at Number 9. "Waiting for someone from the Milky Way Realm?"
Number 9 nodded. "Yes!
I need supplies! "
Lan Ruo hesitated for a moment, then said, "What are you doing here?"
Number 9 said, "Exploring!
Our duty is to explore the universe and explore higher civilizations.
Also, to find someone! "
Ye Xuan was curious. "Find someone?
Who? "
Number 9 nodded. "Find a man with the same bloodline as you!"
Ye Xuan blinked. "A man with the same blood as me?"
Number Nine nodded slightly. "This is my main mission. My secondary mission is to explore, to explore a higher level of martial arts civilization, and then learn from their civilization."
Ye Xuan said in a deep voice, "Ninth, have you found that man?"
Number 9 shook his head. "No!
However, if it really doesn't work, I'll bring you back!
Your bloodline is the same anyway! "
Ye Xuan was speechless.
At this moment, Lan Ruo said, "Ninth Lady, you don't participate in the disputes of this world, right?"
Number Nine nodded. "We basically don't care about the affairs of other universes. We just explore, but …"
She looked at Ye Xuan and said, "If you want to fight, I can help."
With that said, she waved her right hand, and a strange object appeared in her hand.
Ye Xuan was a little curious. "What is this?"
Number Nine blinked. "In the words of your world, this is a divine artifact!"
Lan Ruo: "…"
Ye Xuan was speechless.
Number Nine smiled and said, "It's very fun!
I just need to press this little red button, and it will shatter a piece of space … "
With that said, she pointed at Lan Ruo and said, "It's equivalent to a full-powered attack from her!"
Lan Ruo looked at Number Nine and said, "You know how strong I am?"
Number Nine nodded. "I can feel it!
You should be considered a top-notch expert in this universe of yours! "
Lan Ruo was silent.
What kind of place was this Milky Way Realm?
Ye Xuan said in a deep voice, "Number Nine, are you really willing to help me fight?
？”
Number Nine looked at Ye Xuan and said with a smile, "Of course!"
Ye Xuan was about to say something when Number Nine suddenly said, "Wait!
I'll contact Master! "
With that said, she turned around and waved her hand lightly. A huge light screen appeared in front of the three of them.
Gradually, the light screen started to tremble. Soon, a woman appeared in the screen!
When this woman appeared, Number Nine instantly stood up straight, no longer laughing and joking like before.
In the light screen, the woman was about to speak when she suddenly looked at Ye Xuan. When she saw Ye Xuan, she was stunned.
Ye Xuan looked at the woman and said, "Senior?"
The woman looked at Ye Xuan and said, "Where's your father?"
Ye Xuan hesitated for a moment and then said, "I don't know!"
The woman frowned slightly. "You don't know?"
Ye Xuan nodded. "I've never seen him before!"
The woman's frown deepened. "You've never seen him before?"
Ye Xuan nodded.
The woman was silent.
Ye Xuan looked at the woman and said, "Senior … you are?"
The woman looked at Ye Xuan and said with a smile, "You should call me Auntie!"
Auntie!
Ye Xuan was speechless.
Lan Ruo's expression also became a little strange. Why was she acknowledging her as her relative?
At this moment, the woman said again, "I'm your biological aunt!"
Ye Xuan looked at the woman and said, "Biological?"
The woman nodded and looked at Ye Xuan with a complicated expression. "Looks like they still haven't been able to resolve the Cause of Misfortune that you're carrying!"
Ye Xuan was a little curious. "Senior, you know about the Cause of Misfortune as well?"
The woman glared at Ye Xuan and said, "I'm your aunt!
Not your senior! "
Ye Xuan hesitated for a moment and then said, "Senior, how can you prove that you're my aunt?"
The woman opened her palm and the blood vessels in her hand suddenly trembled. Gradually, a powerful force spread out from her body!
Crazy Demon Bloodline!
Although this Crazy Demon Bloodline was not quite the same as his, it was indeed the Crazy Demon Bloodline!
The woman looked at Ye Xuan and said, "My bloodline is not quite the same as yours. That's because your father raised the family bloodline to an unprecedented height. Therefore, your bloodline is not exactly the same as mine."
Ye Xuan said in a low voice, "Are you really my aunt?"
The woman glared at Ye Xuan and said, "Child, do you think I would recognize someone else as my nephew for no reason?"
Ye Xuan fell silent.
The sudden appearance of an aunt was something he had not expected at all!
Moreover, this aunt was from the Milky Way Realm.
At this moment, the woman looked at Number 9 and said, "Still no news of him?"
Number 9 nodded and said, "Not yet!"
The woman fell silent.
At this moment, Number 9 suddenly said, "Can I bring him back?"
As she said that, she pointed at Ye Xuan.
Ye Xuan was speechless.
On the screen, the woman looked at Ye Xuan and said, "Do you want to come?"
Ye Xuan shook his head and said, "I still have a lot of things to do!"
The woman nodded and said softly, "It's indeed not convenient for you to come now!"
As she said that, she paused and said, "Is there anything I can help you with?"
Ye Xuan blinked and said, "Can I help you with anything?"
The woman smiled and said, "You can tell me about it!"
Ye Xuan hesitated and said, "I have a lot of enemies … and they are all very strong …"
The woman nodded and said, "I understand!"
Ye Xuan blinked and said, "Understand?"
The woman looked at Number 9 and said, "Pass down the order, get all the Milky Way Sect disciples who are exploring the universe to rush to your universe and listen to his orders unconditionally!"
Number 9 nodded and said, "Understood!"
Ye Xuan was speechless.
”
The woman looked at Ye Xuan with a complicated expression and said, "You must live well!"
As she said that, the screen gradually became illusory.
Ye Xuan looked at Number 9 and Number 9 said in a low voice, "My energy is running out!"
Ye Xuan nodded and said, "Miss Number 9, I still have a lot of things to deal with. Will you come with me?"
Number 9 smiled and said, "Not for now!
First, I need to replenish my energy. Second, I need to contact the Milky Way Sect disciples here. They will all be here!
I will go and look for you!
Is that okay? "
Ye Xuan nodded and said with a smile, "Alright!"
Number 9 said, "Then we'll meet again!"
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "See you again!"
After saying that, he turned and left with Lan Ruo.
After leaving the Milky Way Sect, Ye Xuan turned around and saw that the Milky Way Sect was hidden again!
Beside Ye Xuan, Lan Ruo said softly, "Young Master Ye, your background is not simple!"
Ye Xuan shook his head and smiled. "Miss Lan Ruo, if I told you that I don't even know my own background, would you believe me?"
Lan Ruo looked at Ye Xuan and said, "I would!"
Ye Xuan was stunned.
Lan Ruo smiled and said, "Young Master Ye has no reason to lie to me, right?"
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "That's true!
Let's go! "
After saying that, he paused and said, "I'm sorry to have made Miss Lan Ruo accompany me here for nothing!"
Lan Ruo shook her head. "My gains today are not small either!"
After saying that, she looked around and said, "Young Master Ye, let's go!"
Ye Xuan nodded.
The two of them left.
Along the way, Lan Ruo did not speak again.
At this moment, she was thinking about a problem.
Perhaps Xuan City could get closer to Ye Xuan. Although doing so might involve them in a whirlpool, there would definitely be benefits.
However, she was still a little hesitant!
They had to be careful about this matter. If they were not careful, Xuan City might be doomed!
Along the way, Ye Xuan kept looking at the sword in his hand.
Unparalleled!
Unparalleled!
With this sword, his battle prowess could be said to have increased by at least two levels!
Most importantly, this sword could help him improve himself and not make him rely on it!
The gains this time were huge!
Ye Xuan put away the sword and sped up!
...
Ultimate Martial Realm.
At the peak of a mountain, a middle-aged man sat cross-legged. His eyes were slightly closed while his hands were raised, and he seemed as if he was in a meditative state.
Wu Li!
A Martial Emperor!
One of the supreme experts in this universe. Not only was he a true God Realm expert, he was even at the peak of the God Realm!
However, he was still unable to take that step.
Right at this moment, Wu Li suddenly opened his eyes. He turned around and saw a woman in a dark green dress standing not far away!
Wu Li's eyes narrowed slightly because he hadn't noticed when this woman had appeared!
The woman's back was facing Wu Li as she smiled and said, "It's best that you don't attack because you can't do anything to me!"
Wu Li was expressionless. "Is that so?"
As he spoke, he blasted his fist forward!
Bang!
The surroundings instantly became illusory!
However, the woman didn't move at all and wasn't affected at all!
At this moment, there was a serious expression in Wu Li's eyes.
The woman opened her palm, and an ancient scroll descended before Wu Li. "It should be able to help you!"
Wu Li looked at the woman and was about to speak, but at this moment, the woman had already disappeared.
Wu Li frowned slightly. A moment later, he opened the scroll, and when he saw the contents, his pupils suddenly constricted …
.....







Chapter 1460
On the peak of the mountain, Wu Li put away the scroll, and he remained silent for a long time before he said softly, "Who exactly are you!?"
There was no response!
A moment later, Wu Li sat cross-legged on the ground.
Cultivate!
Previously, he was already a little lost in cultivation because he had already reached his limit!
Previously, it was as if he had no other way out!
But now, the contents of this ancient scroll had pointed out a path for him!
This time, he had a 90% chance of breaking through!
He seemed to have thought of something, and he opened his eyes and looked up into the sky. At this moment, he thought of that woman in a simple dress!
The woman who had threatened him!
That woman was so powerful that he didn't dare to make a move against her back then.
Because he wasn't confident!
He could only watch helplessly as the youth rescued Jia Lou from the Naga Dragon Tribe!
He could not take this lying down!
Wu Li slowly closed his eyes. "Woman, just you wait!"
As he spoke, he began to cultivate. Gradually, the aura around him grew stronger and stronger …
...
On the other side, the woman stood in the clouds and looked down. No one knew what she was thinking.
At this moment, the Holy Leader appeared beside the woman.
The Holy Master saluted respectfully, "Master, Ye Xuan went to an unknown starfield, but the Mysterious City's City Lord is following him. Our people don't dare to approach!"
The woman smiled. She looked in the direction of the Fifth Dimension and said softly, "If I'm not wrong, he should be about to awaken the Spirit of the Great Dao!
As long as he dared to awaken the spirit of the Great Dao, the Dao Sect would fight to the death!
In addition to Wu Li who was about to break through … What happened next should be very fun!
However, this is still not enough! "
The Sacred Leader was a little curious. "Other than us and the Dao Sect, does he have any other enemies?"
The woman smiled and said, "Yes!
And there were a lot of them!
Because of the Dao scripture! "
As she spoke, she glanced at the sky and said softly, "There are some mysterious powers. However, these powers have hidden themselves too deeply!
Ordinary people did not even know of their existence!
And these mysterious powers are very interested in the Dao Scripture! "
The Holy Master asked, "Why?"
The woman laughed, "Because they all want to reach the level of the Dao Scripture's owner!"
The Hallowed Lord hesitated for a moment and said, "Master, in your opinion, how strong is the owner of that scripture?"
The woman's smile gradually disappeared. "Very strong!"
The Sacred Lord fell silent.
Very strong!
To be able to gain the approval of the master in front of him, he was definitely not an ordinary person!
The woman continued, "How could someone who could create a martial arts system be an ordinary person?"
As soon as she finished speaking, she looked up into the sky and said with a smile, "I'm going to see that little fellow!"
After saying that, she disappeared directly.
...
In the Five-Dimensional Universe.
After Ye Xuan parted ways with Lan Ruo, he returned to the Fifth Dimension. As soon as he did so, Nian Nian appeared in front of him.
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "You knew I was coming back?"
Nian Nian shook her head. "It was Sister Yue who told me!"
Yue Zun!
Ye Xuan gently rubbed Nian Nian's little head. "It's been hard on you these days, hasn't it?"
Nian Nian shook her head again. "It wasn't hard!"
As she spoke, she raised her head and looked at Ye Xuan, "I've already finished reading those scriptures!"
Ye Xuan asked, "Are you done?"
Nian Nian nodded. "They're waiting for you!"
Ye Xuan held Nian Nian's hand. "Let's go!"
Nian Nian smiled sweetly and turned to leave with Ye Xuan.
At the moment they turned around, Ye Xuan did not notice that Nian Nian tilted her head slightly and glanced at the sky.
In the sky, in the clouds, a woman in a dark green dress smiled. "What a Fifth Dimension Tendo!"
This woman was the mysterious woman from the Holy Land.
The mysterious woman looked down.
Looking at the backs of Ye Xuan and Nian Nian below, she smiled and said, "It seems that I have to be careful of this Fifth Dimension Tendo …"
...
Inside the hall.
Ye Zhiming handed a scroll to Ye Xuan, "The contents and notes of the ninth volume, as well as mental cultivation methods and martial arts!"
As she spoke, she paused and said, "Only Nian Nian knows the contents!"
Ye Xuan looked at Yue Xi and Yue Zun who were not far away. Yue Xi smiled and said, "Young master Ye, the ninth volume of martial arts and mental cultivation methods, we …"
Ye Xuan pointed and the scroll in his hand flew to Yue Xi, "Sect Leader Yue, make a copy!"
Yue Xi was silent.
She also wanted the complete version of the ninth volume of martial arts and mental cultivation methods!
However, she was very clear that this was a bit greedy!
Moreover, most importantly, she wanted to bring the experts of Whirling Sect back to Whirling World.
It was too dangerous to continue staying here!
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "Sect Leader Yue, this ninth volume originally belonged to Whirling Sect. Since you gave it to me, how could I keep it for myself?
Just accept this Dao scripture martial art and Dao scripture mental cultivation method! "
Yue Xi was silent.
Ye Xuan said again, "Sect Leader Yue and the others have been out for some time, they must be homesick, right?"
Yue Xi also looked homesick. Ye Xuan smiled and said, "I understand Sect Leader Yue's thoughts and also respect Sect Leader Yue's thoughts!"
Yue Xi's expression was complicated, "Young master Ye … I have to consider the whole sect, I'm sorry!"
After saying that, she turned and left.
Ye Xuan suddenly said, "Sect Leader Yue Xi!"
Yue Xi stopped and turned to look at Ye Xuan. Ye Xuan took the scroll and walked to Yue Xi, "This is what your Whirling Sect deserves!
Also, your Whirling Sect does not owe me, Ye Xuan anything. On the contrary, I owe you a favor. "
After a moment of silence, Yue Xi said, "Young master Ye, take care!"
After saying that, she took the scroll and left.
Yue Zun looked at Ye Xuan, "Take care!"
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "Take care!"
Yue Zun also left.
They left!
Ye Zhiming suddenly said, "With this, the Whirling Sect will take more than thirty Consolidation Realm experts with them!"
Ye Xuan said softly, "They have no obligation to stay and die with us!
Isn't that right? "
Ye Zhiming was silent.
At this time, Bai Dizi walked in.
Ye Xuan looked at Bai Dizi, "How is the situation in the Fifth Dimension now?"
Bai Dizi said in a deep voice, "After the Whirling Sect leaves, we still have sixty-eight Consolidation Realm experts!
As for our Fifth Dimension … we still don't have any Consolidation Realm experts. However, Miss An Lanxiu and the others are already trying to break through to the Consolidation Realm. If nothing unexpected happens, Miss An Lanxiu and the others will reach the Consolidation Realm within a month! "
Ye Xuan nodded. An Lanxiu, Xiao Qi, Aro, Zhang Wenxiu, and the other girls had always been the focus of the Fifth Dimension's nurturing!
It could be said that all the resources were prioritized toward them!
Bai Dizi said again, "According to my people's investigation, the Dao Sect has already called for their disciples to return to the sect. In addition, they are also mobilizing some forces that are attached to them. They may be making a big move recently!"
A big move!
Ye Xuan was silent for a moment, then said, "What about the Boundless Sacred Ground?"
Bai Dizi shook his head, "There is no movement from this force."
Ye Xuan frowned slightly, "No movement?"
Bai Dizi nodded.
Ye Xuan said softly, "Miss Lanruo told me that we must be careful of the Boundless Sacred Ground because the former Daoting is their mortal enemy. Moreover, Qing Zhu and the others are still exiled …"
Bai Dizi said in a deep voice, "This force will not let us grow!"
Ye Xuan nodded, "You shouldn't be able to find anything. I will ask Xuan City to help investigate this force!"
Bai Dizi nodded, "Alright!"
Ye Xuan looked at Bai Dizi, "How's the Power of Faith?
Why don't I feel anything? "
Bai Dizi smiled, "You!
Try activating your God's Seal! "
Ye Xuan nodded, he activated the God's Seal. The next moment, his face changed instantly!
Endless Power of Faith surged out from the God's Seal and converged towards his body like a tide.
Gradually, Ye Xuan's face changed!
Because he found that after the Power of Faith entered his body, it completely merged with his body!
The White Emperor's son smiled and said, "This is the purest power of faith!
With the support of this Power of Faith, your combat strength will increase by at least two to three levels. If it's a little more, your strength will become even more terrifying! "
Power of Faith!
Ye Xuan spoke softly, "I finally understand why some people like to deceive others!"
Needless to say, the Power of Faith was really extraordinary. Moreover, one didn't need to cultivate. So long as others believed in one, one would be able to obtain an endless supply of Power of Faith!
It was simply like becoming stronger while lying down!
At this time, the White Emperor's Son said, "I invited the Ancient Clan, the Southern Yue Clan, and the Xuan City to discuss the Taoist scriptures. Among these forces, the Chi Clan of the Heavenly Oblivion Galaxy did not come. I'm afraid this force will become our enemy!
Ye Xuan asked, "What's the attitude of the ancient race and Southshine Clan?"
Bai Dizi looked at Ye Xuan, "They've already made it clear that they won't become enemies with us, and they won't interfere in the matter between us and the Dao Sect!"
Ye Xuan nodded, "In other words, our biggest enemy now is the Dao Sect."
Bai Dizi nodded, "We still don't know anything about the Dao Sect's strength, and it's extremely disadvantageous to us!
However, I believe they're definitely afraid of the white robed woman and Miss Tingyun!
Otherwise, with their strength, they would've made a move long ago! "
Ye Xuan slowly closed his eyes. With his current strength, killing a Consolidation Realm expert was basically no problem!
However, the Dao Sect didn't just have Consolidation Realm experts!
Moreover, as the birthplace of the Dao Scriptures, this place was definitely not that simple!
At this moment, Ye Zhiming suddenly said, "Should we awaken the Spirit of the Great Dao?"
Ye Xuan looked at Ye Zhiming, "Can we awaken it?"
Ye Zhiming nodded, "As long as we combine the nine Dao Scriptures!"
Just as Ye Xuan was about to speak, Nian Nian suddenly said, "No!"
Ye Xuan and the other two looked at Nian Nian. Nian Nian was stunned, then a little confused, "What's wrong?"
Ye Xuan looked at Nian Nian, "You just said no!"
Nian Nian looked at Ye Xuan, still a little confused, "Did I say that?"
Ye Xuan and Ye Zhiming looked at each other, and Ye Zhiming sent a voice transmission with Xuan Qi, "She's weird sometimes!"
Ye Xuan glanced at Nian Nian, he gently rubbed her little head, and said softly, "If we summon the Spirit of the Great Dao now, what do you think will happen?"
Bai Dizi said solemnly, "Not to mention anything else, the Dao Sect will definitely fight us to the death, and some of the forces that are still watching will probably take action to snatch the Dao Scriptures and the Spirit of the Great Dao …"
Ye Xuan squatted down, looked at Nian Nian, and smiled slightly, "I understand!"
Nian Nian held Ye Xuan's hand tightly.
A moment later, while Ye Xuan and the others were discussing matters, Nian Nian left the main hall.
After leaving the main hall, Nian Nian unknowingly came to a cloud. To be precise, she came to the woman in a dark green dress.
The woman looked at Nian Nian in front of her, smiling without saying a word.
Nian Nian looked at the woman, and a moment later, she suddenly smiled, "Isn't it good to be alive?"
The woman blinked, "I remember you saying before that no one can kill you without using three strikes, right?"
Nian Nian nodded, "I did!"
The woman's lips curled up, "I'm a little more arrogant than you. If I don't use three strikes, I can kill anyone I want!"
....
PS: I also want to be able to say something especially awesome one day: If I don't use it, who dares to be first in the monthly votes?
Everyone, do you think I'll ever have the chance to say something so awesome in my life?







Chapter 1461
Three strikes!
Nian Nian looked at the woman in front of her. "How arrogant!"
The woman smiled and said, "Same to you!"
Nian Nian said, "Let's go?"
The woman nodded. "Alright!"
The two women strolled through the clouds.
Nian Nian said softly, "You're the first person to discover me!"
The woman smiled and said, "You're also the first person to discover me!"
Nian Nian turned her head and looked down. "The current Five-Dimensional Universe is the Five-Dimensional Universe in my heart!"
The woman nodded. "You didn't misjudge me!"
Nian Nian smiled and said, "Yes!"
She was quite proud!
The woman chuckled and said, "You shouldn't have gotten involved in his karma."
Nian Nian shrugged. "It's too late to retreat now.
Isn't that so? "
The woman glanced at Nian Nian and smiled. "You don't want to retreat!"
Nian Nian blinked. "I'm his Sister Nian!"
The woman looked up at the sky and said softly, "You deliberately lost your memory because you didn't want to be targeted by the calamity on him. You wanted to use another method to protect him!"
Nian Nian smiled and said, "You didn't dare to attack directly because of the woman in the plain dress!"
The woman nodded. "I can't beat her!"
Nian Nian said, "I can't beat her either!"
The two women looked at each other and smiled.
At this moment, the woman stopped. She looked down and said softly, "Do you know?
The moment I saw him, I almost gave up! "
Nian Nian was a little curious. "Why?"
The woman smiled and said, "I don't know why either!
I can't explain that feeling. "
Nian Nian asked, "What's his relationship with you?"
The woman smiled. "He can be considered family!"
Nian Nian blinked. "Considered family?"
The woman nodded. "Very close!"
Nian Nian smiled and said, "And you wanted to kill him!
It looks like there's a story! "
The woman smiled and said, "There's indeed a story!
However, it's all the grudges of the older generation. I don't want to talk about it! "
Nian Nian blinked. "I think there's someone responsible for every grievance. What do you think?"
The woman laughed. "I think you're right. However, if I kill him, he definitely deserves it."
Nian Nian was silent.
The woman stopped. She looked at the sky and said softly, "You won't dare to recover your memories in a short period of time, and you won't dare to forcefully interfere with his matters. Am I right?"
Nian Nian nodded. "Yes."
The woman said with a smile, "Then we shall meet again!"
After saying that, she walked into the distance.
Behind him, Nian Nian looked at the woman in silence.
At that moment, a man appeared behind Nian Nian.
It was Ye Xuan!
Ye Xuan looked at Nian Nian. "Nian Nian, who is she?"
Nian Nian was stunned. The calmness in her eyes turned into confusion. She looked up at Ye Xuan. "Who is it?"
Ye Xuan pointed at the woman who had already disappeared in the distance. "That woman!"
Nian Nian looked into the distance. A moment later, she said softly, "I don't know!"
Ye Xuan frowned slightly.
There was something wrong with Nian Nian!
At this moment, Nian Nian grabbed Ye Xuan's hand. "Let's go!"
Ye Xuan looked at Nian Nian and asked softly, "Are you alright?"
Nian Nian shook her head slightly. "I'm fine!"
Ye Xuan squatted down and stared at Nian Nian. "Are you really alright?"
Nian Nian lowered her head slightly and said softly, "I … I don't know either. I've been having some strange dreams recently!"
Ye Xuan asked softly, "What dream?"
Nian Nian shook her head. "Just thinking about it gives me a headache!"
Ye Xuan hurriedly said.
"Then I won't think about it anymore!"
As he said that, he gently rubbed Nian Nian's little head. "Let's go back!"
Nian Nian nodded. "Alright!"
Ye Xuan turned his head and looked in the direction that the woman had disappeared in. Then, he pulled Nian Nian and left.
...
Dao Sect.
In a certain hall, the Fourth Dao Elder was sitting cross-legged on the ground. At that moment, his body had already condensed, but it was no longer a Dao Body!
His Dao Body had been shattered by that woman!
If he wanted to cultivate it again, it would be extremely difficult!
In front of the Fourth Dao Elder was a statue of a middle-aged man. The middle-aged man held an ancient scroll in his hand and looked very elegant and quiet.
This person was the Dao Sect's Patriarch!
The founder of the Dao Scripture!
At that moment, an old man walked in and bowed respectfully to the Fourth Dao Elder. "We received news that Ye Xuan seems to be looking for the white-robed woman and Situ Tingyun!"
The Fourth Dao Elder opened his eyes. "Have you found them?"
The old man shook his head. "I don't know!"
The Fourth Dao Elder was silent. After a moment, he said again, "Any news from the Second Master?"
The old man shook his head. "No news at all!"
The Fourth Dao Elder asked again, "What about the Holy Land?
What exactly is their attitude? "
The old man said in a deep voice, "The Holy Land … They're a little perfunctory!"
The Fourth Dao Elder frowned slightly. "What do you mean?"
The old man said, "What the Holy Land means is that they are also mortal enemies with Ye Xuan, but they have no intention of making a move!
I think they want us to fight Ye Xuan to the death first, and then they'll reap the benefits! "
The Fourth Dao Elder's face was expressionless. "Idiots!
They're still scheming against us even now. It's impossible for the Holy Land to achieve anything! "
The old man nodded. "Besides the Holy Land, Dark City, the Ancient Clan, and the Southshine Clan have expressed that they won't interfere in the matter between us and Ye Xuan!"
The Fourth Dao Elder looked at the old man. "Dark City has expressed its position as well?"
The old man nodded.
The Fourth Dao Elder fell silent.
The old man continued, "Our Dao Sect's disciples have basically all returned, and those who haven't are on their way back!
Besides that, some of our subordinate powers have sent their strongest experts to our Dao Sect as well. "
As he spoke, he looked at the Fourth Dao Elder. "Fourth Master, when do you think we should make a move?"
The Fourth Dao Elder shook his head. "Ye Xuan alone can kill him as easily as killing a chicken!
But what happens after he's killed?
The people behind him will definitely launch a frenzied revenge against our Dao Sect!
Moreover, if they continue to target our Dao Sect while hiding in the shadows, then our Dao Sect will be in an extremely bad situation!
So, if we want to kill Ye Xuan, we must first destroy the powers behind him, and we can use Ye Xuan to draw them out. "
The old man hesitated for a moment before he said, "Fourth Master's words make sense. However, we still don't understand the powers behind Ye Xuan …."
The Fourth Dao Elder spoke softly, "It doesn't matter. So long as Ye Xuan is here, they will show themselves!
This time, our Dao Sect will go all out. Let me see if the powers behind him can fight our Dao Sect! "
As he spoke, he gazed at the old man. "Use all the connections of our Dao Sect and invite all the experts we can. Moreover, tell them that our Dao Sect will share all the Dao Scriptures once we succeed!"
Share all the Dao Scriptures!
The old man nodded slightly. "Alright!"
As soon as he finished speaking, he turned around and left.
Within the hall, the Fourth Dao Elder slowly closed his eyes.
At this moment, he recalled what Ye Ling had said before he left.
Ye Xuan had a sister!
The woman in the plain dress!
Previously, the Dao Sect had sent people to look for the woman in the plain dress, but all of them had died!
However, this didn't mean anything because with his strength, it wouldn't be too difficult for him to kill ten Consolidation Realm experts!
Moreover, if the woman in the plain dress wasn't strong enough …
It was very likely that she had already been injured when she killed the ten Consolidation Realm experts of the Dao Sect.
If that was the case, then this woman in the plain dress would be the breakthrough point for the Dao Sect!
However, he was still a little worried!
He was worried that Ye Ling was lying to him!
However, the problem was that an expert of this level shouldn't be lying, right?
...
Somewhere in the starry sky, there was a city in this star field. This city wasn't big, it was just a small city.
Divine City.
This city was extremely special. Very few people in the world knew about it because there was a requirement to enter this city!
That was to be at least half a step into the Divine Realm!
It could be said that this city was a club, a club of top experts.
On this day, a middle-aged man came to the Divine City. This person was the Second Dao Elder!
After the Second Dao Elder entered the city, there was only a small tavern in the city.
The Taoist Second Brother arrived at the tavern. At this time, the tavern was a little deserted. There were only three people in the tavern: a tavern manager who was calculating with an abacus, a waiter who was cleaning the tables and chairs, and a swordsman who was drinking.
Seeing the Second Dao Elder, the tavern owner smiled slightly. "What do you need, sir?"
The Second Dao Elder walked in front of the tavern owner. "I'm looking for someone!"
The tavern owner shook his head. "Sir, this is a place to drink."
The Second Dao Elder looked at the tavern owner. He took out a storage ring and placed it in front of the tavern owner. The tavern owner glanced at it. There were a total of one billion Fortune Divine Crystals in the storage ring!
One billion!
This was a huge sum of money!
The tavern owner glanced at the Second Dao Elder. "Who are you looking for!"
The Second Dao Elder said in a deep voice, "The Third Young Lady!"
The tavern owner asked, "The Third Young Lady of the Dao Sect?"
The Second Dao Elder nodded.
The tavern owner put away the storage ring and pointed to a table in front of him. "Half a month ago, she drank here."
The Second Dao Elder frowned slightly. "Where is she now?"
The tavern owner said, "The Northern Wilderness!"
The Second Dao Elder was stunned.
The Northern Wilderness!
Not far away, the swordsman who was drinking suddenly stopped.
The tavern owner said with a smile, "It's not too late to chase after her now!"
The Second Dao Elder was silent.
The tavern owner said with a smile, "Would you like a cup of Spring Sword?"
The Second Dao Elder took out another storage ring and placed it in front of the tavern owner. "Ask about someone!"
The tavern owner put away the storage ring and said, "Who?"
The Second Dao Elder looked at the tavern owner. "Ye Xuan!"
Ye Xuan!
The tavern owner was stunned and asked, "The Five-Dimensional Universe?"
The Second Dao Elder nodded.
After a moment of silence, the tavern owner put the storage ring back in its original position and shook his head.
The Second Dao Elder frowned slightly. "Do you not know or do you not dare to say?"
The tavern owner said with a smile, "I know a little about Dao Yi, but I can't say!"
The Second Dao Elder stared at the tavern owner. "You can't say?"
The tavern owner nodded.
The Second Dao Elder was silent.
Who was this Ye Xuan?
Why were the people of this place so afraid of him?
One must know that the Dao sects did not dare to be arrogant in this place!
At this moment, the tavern owner suddenly said, "Dear customers, we are going to close!"
The Second Dao Elder glanced at the story and turned to leave.
Not far away, the swordsman put down his wine glass and got up to leave.
Not long after the two left, the tavern owner came to a room in the tavern and bowed slightly. "Master …"
Inside the room, a voice sounded. "Are you wondering why I didn't let you investigate that Ye Xuan?"
The tavern owner nodded. "This disciple is indeed puzzled!"
Inside the room, the voice was silent for a long time before saying, "The son of an old friend!"
The tavern owner: "…"
...







Chapter 1462
After Second Brother left the tavern, he went straight to the Northern Wilderness!
Along the way, Second Brother's expression was solemn.
He came to the Divine City for two purposes. One was to find the Third Young Lady, and the other was to inquire about Ye Xuan's background!
In his opinion, this tavern should know about Ye Xuan's background!
What he did not expect was that the tavern's people did not dare to say it!
It was not that they did not know, but they did not dare to say it!
This was thought-provoking!
In any case, Taoism had no way out now!
Second Brother sped up.
...
In the Five-Dimensional Universe.
On this day, Ye Xuan came to a hall. Inside the hall stood a middle-aged man!
The Ninth Master!
Ye Xuan walked to the Ninth Master and took out a scroll and handed it to him.
The Ninth Master glanced at the scroll. It was a Dao Scripture!
A complete version of Dao Scripture!
The Ninth Master looked at Ye Xuan and smiled. "You're giving it to me just like that?"
Ye Xuan said with a smile, "Are you touched?"
The Ninth Master shook his head and smiled. "A little, but … are you really giving it to me just like that?"
Ye Xuan smiled. "You've helped me a lot along the way."
The Ninth Master thought for a moment and said. "Actually, I'm afraid of the plain-dressed woman!"
Ye Xuan blinked. "Senior, I've heard you say that you can take two strikes from Qing 'er … This …"
The Ninth Master laughed. "Ye Xuan, you're not a good friend!
How dare you slap my face! "
Ye Xuan said with a smile, "Take it!"
The Ninth Master's expression was complicated. "To be honest, we've all underestimated her!"
As he said, he looked at Ye Xuan. "Back then, I was still very weak. In my opinion, she was only one or two levels higher than me. But now, it seems that my thoughts were too ridiculous."
Ye Xuan was silent.
Didn't he also underestimate Qing 'er's strength?
Meanwhile, the 9th House added, "Actually, we might be underestimating her as well!"
Ye Xuan looked at the ninth floor. "What do you mean?"
The Ninth Floor smiled, "Because we have been using our knowledge to measure her, but she has already surpassed our knowledge.
Just like a frog at the bottom of a well, it has always used its own thoughts to measure the sky outside. Even if it feels that the sky might be bigger than it imagined, how could it have imagined that the sky was not as big as it imagined? "
As he spoke, he looked at Ye Xuan. "It's not that your enemy is too stupid, it's that she's too strong!
It's so abnormal that it shouldn't even exist in this world! "
Ye Xuan was silent.
At this moment, he thought of Bai Dizi.
Bai Dizi had actually been paying attention to the plain-dressed lady all along. But in the end, he discovered that he had still underestimated her!
Including him, Ye Xuan!
Back in Green City, he had thought that Qing 'er was a sword deity … But now, it seemed that it was such a stupid idea!
The Ninth House said, "I'm telling you one thing. The Daoists aren't scary because they don't know the true strength of the plain-dressed lady!
What's scary?
He was the kind of person who knew the true strength of the plainly dressed woman, but still dared to make an enemy out of her!
This kind of person is a real threat to you. "
Ye Xuan nodded. "I understand what you mean!"
The Ninth House smiled. "At first, I thought you were just a prophet in the afterlife. But then I realized that things aren't that simple!"
Ye Xuan said with a smile, "To be honest, I'm still very confused about many things!"
The Ninth House said, "Becoming stronger is the way to go!
However, I realized that no matter how hard you try to become stronger, your enemy will always be much stronger than you … What a tragedy! "
Ye Xuan was speechless. "You're taking pleasure in my misfortune!"
The Ninth House laughed. "By the way, I have to go too!"
Ye Xuan was puzzled. "Go?"
The Ninth House nodded. "I've been away for so long. Now that I've regained my freedom, I want to go back and have a look!"
Ye Xuan hesitated, then asked, "Will you come back?"
The Ninth House smiled. "Yes!"
Ye Xuan took out a Storage Ring and handed it to the Ninth House. "Take care!"
With that, he turned and left.
The Ninth House glanced at the Storage Ring and was stunned the next moment.
There were ten million Fortune Divine Crystals in the Storage Ring!
...
After parting ways with the Ninth House, Ye Xuan came to a silent starry sky. In his hand was the Supreme Sword!
He didn't immediately cultivate the Ninth Dao Scripture's cultivation method and martial arts because he hadn't even cultivated the Instant Kill Sword and the Burning Heaven Sword to their limits!
What he needed to do now was to use this sword to cultivate his Instant Kill Swordsman to his limits. Only then would he consider cultivating the Ninth Dao Scripture's martial arts!
While Ye Xuan was cultivating, a few new Half-Step Consolidation Realm experts appeared in the Fifth Dimension!
An Lanxiu!
When he learned that An Lanxiu had broken through, Bai Dizi was also shocked!
He knew that An Lanxiu and the other girls were talented, but he didn't expect that An Lanxiu would reach the Half-Step Consolidation Realm so quickly after obtaining cultivation resources!
Faster than White Robe and Zhen Wu!
Although it was only a half-step, it was still very terrifying!
Not long ago, An Lanxiu was only in the Dao Realm!
How long had it been to reach the Half-Step Consolidation Realm?
Of course, this was a very good thing for the current Fifth Dimension!
Currently, the Fifth Dimension was lacking in experts!
...
The Northern Wilderness.
The Northern Wilderness was a wasteland, and this wasteland was not simple. It could even be called a forbidden area.
Even a half-step Divine Realm expert would not dare to step into it!
The reason why this place became a forbidden area was because the Dao Sect's ancestor had set up a powerful enchantment here.
No one knew why the Dao Sect's ancestor set up a enchantment here, not even the people of the Dao Sect!
Although countless years had passed, the enchantment was still strong. Only half-step Divine Crystal Realm experts could barely get close to this wasteland.
The Second Dao Brother came to the top of a mountain. Below the mountain was a wasteland. At first glance, it was a blurry wasteland.
Enchantment!
The Second Dao Brother looked into the distance, his face a little gloomy.
He was already too late!
At this time, a man with a long blade suddenly appeared behind the Second Dao Brother.
The Second Dao Brother glanced at the man with the long blade. "You've been following me for so long, what's the matter?"
The man with the long blade was expressionless. "Do you need a thug?"
The Second Dao Brother narrowed his eyes slightly. "What do you want!"
The man with the long blade said, "As far as I know, your master once created a sword skill. No one in your Dao Sect can successfully cultivate this sword skill, right?"
The Second Dao Brother looked at the man. "You're Blade Addict!"
The man said, "Give me that scroll, I'll kill that Ye Xuan for you!"
The Second Dao Brother shook his head. "You can't kill him by yourself."
The man looked at the Second Dao Brother. "I can try!"
The Second Dao Brother said in a deep voice. "I can give you that scroll, but I have a condition. This condition is not for you to kill Ye Xuan, because you can't kill him by yourself!
What I want is for you to follow me to the Dao Sect. When I want you to attack, attack! "
After a moment of silence, the Blade Addict nodded. "Okay!"
The Second Dao Brother pointed his finger and an ancient scroll appeared in front of the man. "This is the first half.
It's the first half. I'll give you the second half after we kill Ye Xuan! "
The Blade Addict said, "Okay!"
The Second Dao Brother slowly clenched his right hand, a strange light flashed in his eyes.
He suddenly realized something!
That was because there were too many martial arts manuals in the Dao Sect. In addition to the Dao scriptures, there were many other martial arts, and these martial arts had a fatal temptation to the experts outside!
If the Dao Sect was willing, who knew how many experts would rush to the Dao Sect to help!
Thinking of this, the Second Dao Brother sneered. He turned around and left!
Back to the Dao Sect!
...
After returning to the Dao Sect, the Second Dao Brother immediately used the Dao Sect's resources to invite experts from all over the heavens to the Dao Sect!
Under the temptation of those martial arts manuals, more and more Consolidation Realm experts rushed to the Dao Sect!
Because there were not only martial arts manuals, but also Dao scriptures, martial arts, and some Dao techniques. These were things that countless people dreamed of!
Under such temptation, not many people could resist!
...
On this day, the Second Dao Brother personally came to the Sacred Land.
The Holy Temple.
The Second Dao Brother looked at the Holy Lord in front of him. "Holy Lord, this time, the Dao Sect will do its best to kill Ye Xuan!"
The Holy Lord was silent.
The Second Dao Brother smiled. "Holy Lord, you should have some understanding of the forces behind Ye Xuan. To be honest, if we cooperate sincerely, this time, Ye Xuan will definitely die!"
The Holy Lord looked at the Second Dao Brother. "What's your Senior Brother's attitude?"
Senior Brother!
The Second Dao Brother shook his head. "His attitude isn't important. What's important is that I represent the entire Dao Sect."
As he spoke, he looked at the Holy Lord. "Holy Lord, tell me if you want to join forces.
Of course, if the Sacred Land wants to see the Dao Sect and Ye Xuan fight to the death, it's not impossible. However, if the Dao Sect loses, I hope the Sacred Land will have a good ending! "
With that, he stood up and left.
The Holy Lord did not speak.
Just as the Second Dao Brother was about to leave the hall, the Holy Lord suddenly looked at him. "The Sacred Land is willing to help!"
The Second Dao Brother looked at the Holy Lord. The Holy Lord smiled. "How about this? If the white-robed woman and Situ Tingyun appear, the Sacred Land will help you deal with them. However, we won't care about anything else!"
After a moment of silence, the Second Dao Brother said, "Alright!"
The Holy Lord asked, "When do we act?"
The Second Dao Brother glanced at the Holy Lord. "Very soon!"
With that, he turned around and vanished.
After the Second Dao Brother left, the Holy Lord immediately went to the small bamboo house in the mountain behind the Sacred Land. At this moment, the mysterious woman was watering the flowers in the garden.
The Holy Lord looked at the mysterious woman. "Master, are we really going to act?"
The mysterious woman smiled. "What do we act?"
The Holy Lord was stunned. "Just now, Master asked me to agree to the Second Dao Brother's request …"
The mysterious woman smiled. "If we don't agree, do you think he would dare to start a war against the entire Fifth Dimension?
Even if he wants to, he wouldn't dare because he's afraid that someone else will take advantage of the situation!
He'll only be at ease if we agree to his request. After that, he'll go find Ye Xuan and fight to the death! "
The Holy Lord hesitated for a moment before he said, "Can he win?"
The mysterious woman said softly, "I'm not asking him to fight. I'm asking Ye Xuan to form an irreconcilable enmity with the Daoist Sect. As long as Ye Xuan forms an irreconcilable enmity with the Daoist Sect, it'll be equivalent to forming an irreconcilable enmity with the Daoist Sect's Ancestor … He obtained the nine Daoist scriptures, and it was originally a good karma. But now, this good karma is about to turn into a bad karma … How wonderful!"
As she spoke up to this point, she looked up at the sky and said softly, "That person from the Ultimate Martial Realm should be about to break through as well!"
....

I'm already prepared!

Chapter 1463
In the Five-Dimensional Universe.
In the starry sky, Ye Xuan opened his palm. Thousands of feet away, a ray of sword light appeared and a certain space was torn apart!
Insta-kill Sword!
With the help of this unparalleled sword, his Insta-kill Sword had reached his limit!
The true limit!
This was because Insta-kill Sword could no longer increase his sword speed!
Although it could no longer increase his speed, it could increase his strength and the power of his sword techniques!
In other words, other than reaching the limit of his speed, there was still room for improvement in other areas!
At this moment, a lady suddenly appeared not far away from Ye Xuan.
It was Lan Ruo!
Ye Xuan looked at Lan Ruo, a little surprised. "Miss Lan Ruo?"
Lan Ruo walked to Ye Xuan with a serious expression. "I have bad news for you!"
Ye Xuan said, "Dao Faction is going to make a move?"
Lan Ruo nodded. "Not just Dao Faction!
They made use of Dao Faction's resources and connections to gather many experts to head to Dao Faction!
These people are not to be underestimated! "
Ye Xuan asked, "How many?"
Lan Ruo glanced at Ye Xuan. "Are you sure you want to know?"
Ye Xuan smiled. "Of course!"
Lan Ruo said, "The Dao Sect itself has at least 460 Consolidation Realm experts. Now, including the experts from their vassal forces, as well as those who have been tempted by martial arts manuals, there are at least 600 Consolidation Realm experts in the Dao Sect now. Among them, there are many who have no lack of Consolidation Realm experts."
Ye Xuan was silent.
This lineup was enough to crush the entire Five-Dimensional Universe!
Lan Ruo continued, "In addition, Second Brother Dao has personally gone to the Holy Land. This means that the Holy Land should have agreed to make a move!
As for the strength of the Holy Land, we can't find anything! "
Can't find anything!
Ye Xuan said softly, "Seems like I should be more worried about the Holy Land!"
Lan Ruo looked at Ye Xuan. "How are you going to deal with Dao Faction!"
Ye Xuan smiled. "We can only fight!"
Lan Ruo frowned. "Fight head-on?"
Ye Xuan said softly, "We definitely can't fight them head-on."
Lan Ruo asked, "Call for help?"
Ye Xuan shook his head.
Lan Ruo was a little puzzled. "Why didn't you call for help?"
Ye Xuan smiled bitterly. "Because I don't know where they are!"
Lan Ruo was stunned. "Are you sure?"
Ye Xuan smiled bitterly. "Miss Lanruo, do you think I need to lie to you?"
Lan Ruo said in a low voice, "Then you're in a rather bad situation now!"
Ye Xuan looked at Lan Ruo and smiled. "Miss Lan Ruo, thank you for reminding me."
Lan Ruo shook his head. "It's just a small matter!"
As she said that, she looked at Ye Xuan. "I don't know what strategy you have, but I want to tell you that if the person behind you doesn't make a move, that door is like a mountain to you, a mountain that you can't overcome!
Take care! "
After saying that, she turned around and disappeared.
Where he was, Ye Xuan looked at the Supreme Sword in his hand and chuckled. "It's time to taste blood!"
After saying that, he disappeared.
...
Dao Domain.
At this moment, the Dao Domain was unprecedentedly lively because countless Consolidation Realm experts were rushing over.
On this day, a man in black arrived at the Dao Domain.
This man in black was naturally Ye Xuan!
However, at this moment, he was dressed in black and looked completely different from before.
He wanted to see how the Dao Sect was going to deal with him!
The moment Ye Xuan entered the Dao Domain, the space in front of him suddenly trembled. The next moment, an old man appeared in front of Ye Xuan.
The old man looked at Ye Xuan. "May I know who you are?"
Ye Xuan was about to speak when a voice sounded from the horizon. "I didn't expect the Young Master Ye of the Fifth Dimension to personally come to my Dao Sect. What a surprise!"
After saying that, a middle-aged man appeared in front of Ye Xuan.
The person who came was Dao Brother Second!
And around him, countless experts appeared one after another!
All of them were at the Consolidation Realm!
In an instant, Ye Xuan was directly surrounded!
Ye Xuan was silent.
'I'm off to a bad start!'
However, he didn't understand how the other party found him.
In the sky, Dao Brother Second looked at Ye Xuan. "Ye Xuan, you underestimate my Dao Sect!"
Ye Xuan nodded. "Indeed, I underestimated you!"
Dao Brother Second looked at Ye Xuan. "Everyone, kill this person, and my Dao Sect will fulfill its promise to you immediately!"
Hearing this, the hundreds of Consolidation Realm experts present all looked at Ye Xuan in unison.
Why did they come here?
Naturally, it was because they wanted to obtain some of the Dao Sect's martial arts manuals!
Especially the Dao scriptures of the Dao Sect!
At this moment, someone was about to make a move, but Ye Xuan suddenly laughed in the distance. "You don't really think that I came alone, do you?"
Hearing this, those who were about to make a move stopped.
They naturally knew about Ye Xuan.
Now, who didn't know that there was a mysterious force behind Ye Xuan?
In the sky, Dao Brother Second looked at Ye Xuan. "Are you trying to scare me?"
Ye Xuan smiled. "Dao Brother Second, do you think I would come here to die for nothing?"
Dao Brother Second looked at Ye Xuan with a calm expression. "Then what are you doing here?"
Ye Xuan was silent.
In fact, he really wanted to directly draw his sword and kill this Dao Brother Second.
However, he wasn't completely confident!
First of all, Dao Brother Second was an expert who surpassed the Consolidation Realm. Secondly, Dao Brother Second had also cultivated a Dao Physique!
That Dao Physique was very likely to be able to block his sword strike!
At this moment, a middle-aged man not far away suddenly laughed. "I think that this Young Master Ye is here to die!"
Ye Xuan looked at the middle-aged man. The middle-aged man looked at Ye Xuan and said with a smile, "Ye Xuan, do you really think that the force behind you can fight against us?
You … "
At this moment, the middle-aged man's voice came to an abrupt halt. His eyes were wide open as he tightly clutched his throat. There was a sword mark on his throat, and blood kept flowing out, instantly dyeing his hands red!
At this moment, everyone present was dumbfounded!
He was killed?
Who killed him?
Soon, everyone looked at Ye Xuan.
Ye Xuan glanced at the crowd and said with a smile, "Everyone, I'm here today to look for the Dao Sect. As for the others, please shut up!
Because I don't have time to argue with you! "
Everyone looked at Ye Xuan. At this moment, there was fear in their eyes.
Ye Xuan had just killed a Consolidation Realm expert!
Most importantly, they did not even see how Ye Xuan had wielded his sword!
The Second Elder was also a little shocked at this moment. He did not expect Ye Xuan to kill a Consolidation Realm expert with a single sword strike!
And it was so easy!
What kind of strength does this guy have?
At this time, Ye Xuan looked at the crowd and said with a smile, "Everyone, I know that Daoting uses some so-called martial arts.
The ancient books tempted you to come and kill me, Ye Xuan!
However, have you ever thought about why the Dao Sect would do that?
It's very simple, because the Dao Sect just wants you to be cannon fodder! "
Cannon fodder!
At this moment, an old man stood out. He looked at Ye Xuan and said, "Young Master Ye, do you know how many people we have here?"
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "A few hundred people!"
The old man said calmly, "Young Master Ye, as far as I know, there are not even a hundred Consolidation Realm experts in the Five-Dimensional Universe. What do you think?"
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "You're right!
In that case, you can make your move! "
The old man looked at Ye Xuan. He did not speak, nor did he make a move!
The Consolidation Realm experts present did not make a move either!
At this moment, they suddenly thought of something!
Why was Ye Xuan so fearless?
It was because of the force behind Ye Xuan!
Not to mention whether they could kill Ye Xuan, even if they did!
What would happen after they killed him?
Whoever killed Ye Xuan would definitely suffer the revenge of that mysterious force!
Not to mention, who could defeat the white-robed woman and Situ Tingyun?
If these two people took revenge, would they be able to survive?
Thinking of this, many people glanced at the Dao Sect in the distance. They could not stand out in this matter!
Seeing that no one made a move, Second Brother Dao slowly clenched his right hand. He knew that these people were all smart people. If he did not make a move, these people would definitely not stand out!
At this moment, Ye Xuan suddenly raised his right hand and slapped it in front of him.
Fen Tianjue!
As the palm fell, a wave of flames slanted out from Ye Xuan's palm. In an instant, the entire starry sky was shattered!
Seeing Ye Xuan suddenly make a move, the experts present were shocked. No one had expected Ye Xuan to suddenly make a move. The few Consolidation Realm experts who were closer to Ye Xuan were directly blasted into nothingness by Ye Xuan's Fen Tianjue, and the other Consolidation Realm experts were also shaken to the point of retreating.
Right at this moment, Second Brother Dao's voice suddenly resounded. "Where do you think you're going!?"
As soon as he finished speaking, Second Brother Dao suddenly stretched his right hand towards the space before him, and then he made a grabbing motion. An enormous hand that could hold up the sky tore through the starry sky over 50,000km away, and then it grabbed fiercely towards Ye Xuan. Ye Xuan suddenly turned around and slashed with his sword!
The Dao Sword!
This strike was swift like a bolt of lightning!
Bang!
The enormous hand trembled violently before it cracked apart, and Ye Xuan was blasted over 100km away. However, in the next moment, his entire body transformed into a strand of light and vanished.
The Dao Domain.
Second Brother Dao's expression was slightly gloomy because he noticed that Ye Xuan had vanished!
At this moment, he suddenly realized that he had slightly underestimated Ye Xuan.
He had greatly underestimated Ye Xuan!
Ye Xuan actually possessed the strength to instantly kill Consolidation Realm experts!
Moreover, he had also cultivated the Dao scripture martial arts of the Dao Sect to such an extent!
Without Second Brother Dao, the expressions of the Consolidation Realm experts present were extremely solemn. Ye Xuan's strength had greatly exceeded their expectations!
Was he really only at the Consolidation Realm?
In the field, it was so quiet that even a pin drop could be heard. Everyone's eyes were filled with fear.
At this moment, the surrounding hundreds of thousands of kilometers of starry sky had turned into a pitch-black spatial black hole. Not only that, but a powerful force was still constantly eroding the origin of the Dao Realm!
Second Brother Dao glanced around and was about to speak when his pupils suddenly shrank. He suddenly turned around, and as he did so, a ray of light from a sword arrived.
Second Brother Dao clenched his fists tightly, and at this moment, a sword directly pierced between his eyebrows …
...







Chapter 1464
Everyone in the field was shocked!
Ye Xuan turned around and attacked!
This was something no one had expected!
Even the Dao Second Brother did not expect this!
How dare Ye Xuan?
When Ye Xuan's sword pierced half an inch into the Dao Second Brother's eyebrows, it could no longer go in.
Dao Physique!
At this critical moment, the Dao Second Brother's Dao Physique played a life-saving role!
Seeing that he could no longer stab in, Ye Xuan stomped his right foot and rotated his right hand forward.
Boom!
The Dao Second Brother was instantly thrown thousands of feet away!
As for Ye Xuan, he turned around and disappeared into the end of the starry sky!
His attack failed, and he fled thousands of miles away!
In the starry sky, the Dao Second Brother slowly closed his eyes. The space between his eyebrows cracked into a spider web. Not only that, but his physical body had also suffered a certain degree of damage!
At this moment, the Dao Second Brother's expression was extremely ugly!
If it were not for his Dao Physique, he would have been killed by Ye Xuan's sword just now!
Even now, he still had lingering fear from that sword strike!
Because it was too fast!
It was so fast that even he could not react!
In the field, the expressions of the Consolidation Realm experts were extremely solemn. At this moment, their hearts were filled with fear!
At this moment, everyone could not help but ask themselves, if Ye Xuan's sword was aimed at them, would they be able to block it?
The answer was no!
Was Ye Xuan a killer or a Swordsman?
At this moment, the Dao Second Brother suddenly said, "Everyone, please take a rest."
After saying that, he turned around and left.
In the field, the Consolidation Realm experts looked at each other.
In fact, at this moment, some of them were already retreating because they realized that Ye Xuan did not look so easy to bully …
...
Somewhere in the starry sky, Ye Xuan stopped and slowly closed his eyes!
He had to say that it was a pity!
He could have killed the Dao Second Brother just now!
Dao Physique!
With his current strength, he still could not cut through the flesh with one sword!
There might be a chance if he slashed a few more times!
After a while, Ye Xuan left.
Ye Xuan did not return to the Fifth Dimension but went directly to the Boundless Sacred Land!
Boundless Holy Land!
Ye Xuan had always been wary of this mysterious force.
This time, he wanted to personally investigate this Boundless Sacred Ground.
Just as Ye Xuan stepped into the Saint realm, in the bamboo house at the back of the mountain, the woman who was reading an ancient book suddenly raised her head. She turned her head to look outside the bamboo house, and the corners of her lips curled up. "Interesting!"
As she spoke, she lowered her head and continued to read.
In the starry sky, Ye Xuan did not advance any further.
Because he realized that he seemed to have been discovered!
This feeling was a little absurd!
Ye Xuan looked in the direction of the Boundless Sacred Ground. Moments later, he turned around and left!
He did not take any more risks!
His current strength was not enough for him to take the risk!
After Ye Xuan left, in the bamboo house in the back mountain of the Holy Land, the mysterious woman smiled, "Very smart!"
At this moment, the Holy Master arrived in front of the bamboo house and bowed slightly, "Master, that Ye Xuan just went to the Dao Sect and then came to our Holy Land. He should have left by now!"
The woman said, "Ignore him!"
The Holy Master nodded. "Understood!"
After saying that, he quietly retreated.
In the bamboo house, the woman read the ancient book, and as she read, her eyes gradually became cold.
...
Ye Xuan arrived at Xuan City. As soon as he stepped into Xuan City, a man in black suddenly appeared behind him.
Ye Xuan turned around, and the man in black threw out his right hand.
Fifteen bloody heads appeared in front of Ye Xuan.
The man in black said, "All of them are Dao Sect's Consolidation Realm experts!"
Ye Xuan looked at the black-clothed man. The black-clothed man in front of him was the one who had killed the Taoism powerhouses at the auction!
He did not expect that the other party would dare to kill Dao Sect's experts!
Moreover, he had really killed fifteen Consolidation Realm experts!
At this moment, the man in black suddenly stretched out his right hand.
Ye Xuan flicked his finger, and a scroll appeared in front of the man in black.
It was the ninth Dao Scripture!
The man in black put away the Dao Scripture and turned to leave.
At this moment, Ye Xuan suddenly said, "There's another deal, do you want to do it?"
The man in black stopped, "What else do you have?"
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "What do you think I can give you?"
The man in black was silent.
Ye Xuan said again, "Can you really understand the ninth Dao Scripture?"
The man in black opened the scroll, and a moment later, he asked, "Can you understand it?"
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "I've already had people study the ninth Dao Scripture thoroughly!
Do you want it? "
The man in black was silent.
Ye Xuan said again, "The Whirling Sect has had the ninth Dao Scripture for so many years, but they still have not fully understood it. Do you think you're better than the Whirling Sect?"
The man in black said, "What do you want me to do?"
Ye Xuan said, "Follow me!"
The man in black shook his head, "No!
You're too dangerous!
Following you is equivalent to risking my life!
It's not worth it! "
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "What if I give you a satisfactory price?"
The man in black looked at Ye Xuan, "What's the price?"
Ye Xuan thought for a moment, then said, "Do you want to go to the Ninth Dimension?"
The Ninth Dimension!
The man in black was stunned.
Ye Xuan looked at the man in black, "I'm serious!"
The man in black said in a deep voice, "Are you really from the Ninth Dimension?"
Ye Xuan nodded, "Yes!"
The man in black was silent for a moment, then said, "How can I believe you?"
Ye Xuan flicked his finger, and the Supreme Sword appeared in front of the man in black, "I brought this out from the Ninth Dimension, take a look!"
The man in black hesitated for a moment, then held the sword. The next moment, he suddenly looked up at Ye Xuan, "This …"
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "You've never seen such a strange sword, right?"
The man in black was silent.
Ye Xuan continued, "You're now at the peak of the Consolidation Realm, do you want to reach a higher level?
For example, the Divine Realm? "
The man in black looked at Ye Xuan, "The force behind you is so strong, why do you still need me?"
Ye Xuan thought for a moment, then said, "I'm the son of the Ninth Dimension, I came here to gain experience, en, like the emperor of the secular world, do you understand?"
The man in black looked at Ye Xuan, "Why do I feel like you're bluffing?"
Ye Xuan said seriously, "I'm a Swordsman!
And I'm the world's top Swordsman!
Do you think such a powerful Swordsman would lie? "
The man in black was silent.
Ye Xuan continued, "Three years, you follow me for three years, after three years, I'll help you reach the Divine Realm, if not …"
Speaking of this, he looked at the man in black, "What's your surname?"
The man in black said, "Yang!"
Ye Xuan hurriedly said, "If I can't help you reach the Divine Realm, I'll change my surname to yours!"
The man in black was speechless.
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "I won't force you. If you don't want to, you can leave."
The black-clothed man shook his head. "Following you is too dangerous!"
With that, he turned to leave.
Meanwhile, Ye Xuan spoke abruptly, "You killed 15 members of the Daoist Sect. They won't let you off!"
The man in black stopped, and Ye Xuan said, "I'm about to summon the Spirit of the Great Dao. Do you really not want to witness the appearance of the Spirit of the Great Dao?
If you follow me, you will.
In order to obtain a detailed explanation of all the Dao scriptures, including the ninth volume.
If you were one of us, believe me, you wouldn't be able to understand this ninth scripture. "
The black-robed man opened the ancient scroll again. After looking at it for a moment, he disappeared.
The corners of Ye Xuan's mouth lifted slightly.
He knew that this person would come looking for him again!
Because he was absolutely unable to understand the ninth scripture!
If not for Nian Nian, even he and Ye Zhiming would not have been able to understand the ninth scripture!
Ye Xuan turned and left. He went to Xuan City and found Lan Ruo.
In a garden somewhere, two people were walking side by side.
Lan Ruo said softly, "I've underestimated you!"
Obviously, she already knew what Ye Xuan had done in the Dao Domain.
To be honest, she was also a little shocked!
Ye Xuan had instantly killed a Consolidation Realm powerhouse, and he had almost killed Dao Lao Er!
If Second Brother Dao didn't have a Dao physique, he would definitely be dead!
One had to know that Ye Xuan had a sword that specifically targeted souls. As long as he became a soul, his combat strength would drop by several levels in front of Ye Xuan.
Ye Xuan looked at Lan Ruo and said with a smile, "Miss Lan Ruo, to be honest, I've come to you this time to ask for your help!"
Lan Ruo glanced at Ye Xuan and said, "Speak!"
Ye Xuan thought for a moment and said, "Are there any assassins in Xuan City?"
Lan Ruo looked at Ye Xuan and said, "Yes!"
Ye Xuan said, "The mental cultivation methods and martial arts of the Dao Realm from the first to the ninth volume of the Dao scriptures!"
Lan Ruo fell silent.
She was very tempted!
No force would not be tempted by the Dao scriptures, mental cultivation methods, and martial arts of the Dao sects.
However, she was still a little hesitant.
If she agreed to Ye Xuan's request, it would be equivalent to taking a risk with Xuan City.
As if he knew what Lan Ruo was thinking, Ye Xuan asked again, "Does the Dao sects know about these people in Xuan City?"
Lan Ruo shook her head. "They're some of Xuan City's trump cards!"
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "How about this? Let's say that these people were trained by the force behind me!"
Lan Ruo looked at Ye Xuan and said, "It's far from enough to deal with the Dao sects!"
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "I know!"
Lan Ruo was silent for a moment before she clapped her hands lightly. The next moment, ten shadows suddenly appeared behind Ye Xuan silently.
Ye Xuan's expression gradually turned solemn.
These ten people had appeared without any warning!
At this moment, he realized that he had underestimated these ancient forces!
The foundations of these forces were extraordinarily deep!
Lan Ruo looked at Ye Xuan and said, "These ten people are very proficient in assassination and tracking. Now, they will listen to your orders!"
Ye Xuan opened his palm and nine scrolls appeared in his hand. He passed the scrolls to Lan Ruo and said, "Nine scrolls of Dao scriptures, mental cultivation methods, and martial arts of the Dao World!"
Lan Ruo looked at Ye Xuan and said, "You're making a loss!"
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "We're friends. Why are we being so calculative?"
Lan Ruo hesitated for a moment before she clapped her hands lightly again. At this moment, another ten men in black appeared behind Ye Xuan!
Twenty super experts!
They were all assassins!
Lan Ruo looked at Ye Xuan and said, "They're all yours!"
Ye Xuan said softly, "Thank you!"
Lan Ruo smiled and said, "At the end of the day, you're the one who's making a loss!"
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "Miss Lan Ruo, I'm going to do something big. So, we'll meet again!"
With that, he turned around and left with the twenty men!
Lan Ruo suddenly said, "Young Master Ye!"
Ye Xuan turned to look at Lan Ruo. Lan Ruo smiled and said, "We'll meet again!"
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "Alright!"
With that, he disappeared with the twenty super assassins.
.....







Chapter 1465
Somewhere in the starry sky, Ye Xuan looked at the twenty people in front of him. These twenty people were all at the peak of the Consolidation Realm, and they were extremely good at concealment and assassination!
Twenty people was not a lot, but it would be different if there were twenty assassins!
Ye Xuan turned and looked in the direction of the Dao Domain.
He did not want to sit still and wait for death!
A moment later, Ye Xuan disappeared with the twenty people.
...
Dao Sect.
In a certain hall, Dao Brother Second sat cross-legged on the ground, his body emitting a dark green luster.
Healing!
Although Ye Xuan's sword had not killed him, it had caused considerable damage to his Dao body.
As if thinking of something, he suddenly opened his eyes, "Pass down the order, Ye Xuan already has the strength to easily kill a Consolidation Realm expert, let all Dao Sect disciples be careful."
Outside the hall, a voice sounded, "Yes!"
Inside the hall, Dao Brother Second slowly closed his eyes.
At this moment, he felt more and more uneasy.
Ye Xuan's strength was far beyond his expectations!
Now, Ye Xuan was only at the Dao Attainment Realm, but he already had the strength to hurt him. One had to know that there was a difference of two realms between him and Ye Xuan!
Not to mention the half-step Divine Realm, there was a world of difference between the Dao Attainment Realm and the Consolidation Realm!
And now, Ye Xuan could surpass two realms!
How terrifying was this?
Could this guy really be from the Ninth Dimension?
Naturally, he did not believe the nonsense that Ye Xuan said.
The Ninth Dimension?
If there really was such a place, the Dao Sect's Patriarch would have definitely mentioned it back then, but the Dao Sect's Patriarch had never mentioned this place!
Moreover, Ye Xuan loved to fool people the most, so how could he believe what he said?
At this moment, Dao Brother Fourth walked into the hall. At this moment, his physical body had already recovered.
Dao Brother Fourth said softly, "We can't delay any longer!"
Dao Brother Second was silent.
"Not long ago, Ye Xuan had a hard time killing a Dao Attainment realm cultivator, but now, he can easily kill a Consolidation realm cultivator!
His growth speed is too terrifying. If this continues, it won't be long before he can easily kill a Half-step Divine Stage expert or even a Divine Stage expert! "
The 2nd Dao Brother said, "We must deal with two people right now, the white robed woman and Situ Tingyun!"
The Fourth Elder said in a low voice, "Not only these two, but also Ye Ling and the woman in the plain dress!
Neither of them are simple. "
The Second Elder was silent. A moment later, he opened his eyes and looked at the statue in front of him with a complicated expression. "If Master was still here, who in this world would dare to bully the Taoist Faction?"
The Fourth Daoist fell silent.
Master!
When the Patriarch of the Dao Sect was still around, who dared to disrespect the Dao Sect?
Who dared to disrespect the Dao Sect?
Who in the world would dare to go against the words of the Dao Sect?
But now …
At this time, Fourth Daoist sighed in a low voice, "It's our incompetence!"
The Second Daoist said softly, "Indeed."
The Fourth Daoist said, "Because of what happened to Ye Xuan, many people have the intention to retreat. So, we can't delay any longer.
Didn't the Sacred Ground agree to let them deal with the white robed woman and Situ Tingyun?
If that's the case, then it'll be easy! "
The Second Daoist fell silent.
The Fourth Daoist asked, "Are you still worried about Ye Ling and the woman in the plain dress?"
The Second Daoist nodded, "Not just those two. I'm afraid that there are others behind him!
The strength of these people … "
The Fourth Daoist looked at the Second Daoist, "You're regretting it!"
The Second Daoist said softly, "Indeed!
My intuition tells me that we might be walking on a path of no return! "
The Fourth Daoist chuckled, "Second Senior Brother, have you ever thought about what will happen if Ye Xuan summons the Grand Dao Spirit?
When he summons the Spirit of the Great Dao, will you and I have to bow down to him? "
The Second Daoist fell silent.
The Grand Dao Spirit!
The reason why the Dao Sect still had no master was because the Dao Sect's ancestor had once said that the person who possessed the Grand Dao Spirit would be the next master of the Dao Sect.
Back then, the Dao Sect had internal strife in order to fight for the complete version of the Dao Scripture!
It was also because of the internal strife that the Dao Scripture was divided into nine parts and scattered across the heavens.
It was also because of that internal strife that the Dao Sect's strength had declined greatly.
At this moment, the Fourth Daoist suddenly said, "We have no way out!
We can only kill Ye Xuan at all costs, obtain the Dao Scripture, and then summon the Grand Dao Spirit! "
The Second Daoist nodded, "Indeed, there is no way out!"
Now that they had become enemies with Ye Xuan, it could be said that either Ye Xuan died or the Dao Sect died!
There was no other way!
They could only kill Ye Xuan!
With that thought, the Second Daoist stood up, "Gather everyone!"
The Fourth Daoist stood up and left.
Not long after, all the experts in the Dao Sect rushed toward the starry sky. In less than 15 minutes, there were more than 600 Consolidation Realm experts gathered in the starry sky of the Dao Sect!
Needless to say, this lineup was extremely terrifying!
More than 600 Consolidation Realm experts, it could be said that at least half of the Consolidation Realm experts in the world were here!
Although the Dao Sect was not as strong as it used to be, it still had the ability to rally people.
In the hall, the Second Daoist stood up and left. He came to a starry sky, and not far in front of him was the Holy Leader of the Boundless Sacred Land.
The Second Daoist looked at the Holy Leader, "If those two women appear, can the Sacred Land handle them?"
The Holy Leader smiled, "Yes!"
The Second Daoist nodded, "That's good!"
The Holy Leader suddenly said, "If we kill Ye Xuan, the Sacred Land wants a complete version of the Dao Scripture!"
The Second Daoist smiled, "No problem!"
The Holy Leader said, "Including the mental cultivation method and the Dao Scripture martial arts!"
The Second Daoist looked at the Holy Leader, "No problem!"
The Holy Leader nodded, "Go!
If those two women appear, the Sacred Land will stand up to them! "
With that, he turned and disappeared into the horizon.
In the field, the Second Daoist looked much more relaxed!
With the help of the Sacred Land, he had more confidence in killing Ye Xuan this time!
Soon, the Second Daoist and the Fourth Daoist led all the experts to the Fifth Dimension.
The two of them did not want to wait any longer!
This time, the Dao Sect really came out in full force.
Obviously, the Dao Sect wanted to fight to the death!
Not long after the Second Daoist and the others left the Dao Domain, Ye Xuan suddenly appeared in the Dao Domain.
He had been hiding in the dark for a long time, and only appeared when he saw the Second Daoist and the others leaving the Dao Domain.
He naturally would not fight with the Second Daoist and the others now!
Ye Xuan looked around. He had to say that the Dao Domain was very cold, very cold, because all the top experts of the Dao Sect had gone to the Fifth Dimension.
Ye Xuan walked down, and at this moment, an angry shout suddenly sounded from afar, "Who are you!"
Ye Xuan casually waved his sword, and a head flew hundreds of meters away.
At the same time, 20 black clothed men suddenly appeared silently in the surroundings, and it wasn't long before numerous shrill cries resounded incessantly.
Ye Xuan slowly walked to the front of a large hall, and there was a statue in front of the hall.
The statue of the Dao Sect's ancestor!
Ye Xuan glanced at the statue, and then walked toward the Dao Palace.
The Dao Palace was very cold, and there was not a single person!
Ye Xuan smiled, and he opened his palm, and the nine Dao Scriptures appeared in his hand. He glanced at the nine Dao Scriptures and said with a smile, "Let's see if you guys panic!"
With that, he slowly closed his eyes, and in front of him, the nine Dao Scriptures suddenly trembled!
Fusion!
The moment all the Dao Scriptures trembled, a mysterious aura suddenly rose from the Dao Sect, and went straight into the depths of the starry sky.
Dao Scriptures fusion!
....
On the other side, the Second Daoist and the others were rushing to the starry sky of the Fifth Dimension. At this moment, a voice sounded in his mind …
The Second Daoist frowned.
The Fourth Daoist asked, "Ye Xuan went to our Dao Domain?"
The Second Daoist nodded.
The Fourth Daoist frowned slightly. "Are we going back?"
The Second Daoist shook his head. "No, he will return to the Fifth Dimension by himself!
Because he is more anxious than us! "
The Fourth Daoist nodded.
Everyone continued forward!
Not long after, the Second Daoist stopped again, and a moment later, his pupils suddenly shrank. "He is fusing the Dao Scriptures, and he wants to summon the Great Dao Spirit back to the Dao Domain!"
With that, he directly turned and left.
The Fourth Daoist was stunned, and he immediately turned and left.
Summon the Great Dao Spirit!
Ye Xuan wants to summon the Great Dao Spirit in the Dao Domain?
Seeing the Second Daoist and the Fourth Daoist rush back, many people present were dumbfounded!
Not going to the Fifth Dimension?
A moment later, everyone hurriedly followed.
The Second Daoist and the others rushed back to the Dao Domain at their fastest speed. When they rushed back to the Dao Domain, Ye Xuan suddenly stopped.
The Second Daoist stared fixedly at Ye Xuan, and his face was terrifyingly gloomy!
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "I didn't expect that you would really come back!"
The Second Daoist slowly clenched his right hand. At this moment, Ye Xuan suddenly smiled and said, "Second Daoist, if you attack, I will immediately fuse the Dao Scriptures and summon the Great Dao Spirit!"
The Second Daoist narrowed his eyes slightly. "Are you threatening me?"
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "Yes, I am!"
The Second Daoist stared fixedly at Ye Xuan, and he slowly clenched his right hand.
Summon the Great Dao Spirit!
If Ye Xuan really summoned the Great Dao Spirit, and the Great Dao Spirit helped Ye Xuan … At that time, they would be in a very awkward situation!
After all, the Patriarch of the Dao Faction had said that the person who obtained the recognition of the Great Dao Spirit would be the Master of the Dao Faction.
If Ye Xuan obtained the recognition of the Great Dao Spirit, then if he continued to kill Ye Xuan, it would be equivalent to going against the will of the Patriarch of the Dao Faction, and many people within the Dao Faction would probably rebel against him!
After all, many people in the Dao Faction respected the words of the Dao Faction's Patriarch like a god.
At this moment, the Fourth Daoist suddenly said, "Ye Xuan, fuse with it!"
The Second Daoist looked at the Fourth Daoist, and the Fourth Daoist smiled and said, "Let him fuse with it!"
The Second Daoist hesitated to speak.
Meanwhile, the Fourth Daoist sent a voice transmission to the Second Daoist, "Will the Great Dao Spirit recognize him after he fuses with it?"
The Second Daoist was stunned.
Right!
Will the Great Dao Spirit recognize Ye Xuan as its master?
Of course not!
Because after the Patriarch of the Dao Faction passed away, the Great Dao Spirit didn't submit to anyone. Otherwise, the Dao Faction wouldn't be without a leader now.
At the thought of this, the Second Daoist looked at Ye Xuan and said, "Ye Xuan, fuse with it!"
Ye Xuan fell silent, and he was slightly afraid.
Would the Great Dao Spirit do him in?
After all, the Great Dao Spirit belongs to the Dao Faction!
If it summoned a father, then it would be a pain in the ass!
....
PS: Give me a monthly ticket, and I will take you to the Ninth Dimension to play!
Those who write books never lie!







Chapter 1466
It was fusing with the Spirit of the Grand Dao!
Actually, he was quite fearful as well.
Because he still remembered what Master Qing had said. The Spirit of the Grand Dao wasn't a benevolent fellow.
He was able to discern that the Dao Sect was very fearful of the Spirit of the Grand Dao. However, if the Spirit of the Grand Dao refused to acknowledge him or even stood on the Dao Sect's side, then it would be a huge pain in the ass!
Meanwhile, Second Brother suddenly laughed coldly, "Ye Xuan, what are you waiting for?"
Ye Xuan gazed at Second Brother and smiled, "As you wish!"
As soon as he finished speaking, he suddenly pressed his palms together, and the Dao Scripture was instantly activated by his strength to fuse the nine scriptures into one!
Bang!
At the instant the nine scriptures fused into one, an invisible force surged out from Ye Xuan, and it instantly caused ripples to arise in the space around him.
The expressions of Fourth Brother and the others gradually became solemn!
The Spirit of the Grand Dao was the spirit of the Dao Scripture, and it was the existence that had followed the ancestor of the Dao Sect for the longest time. Moreover, the status of the Dao Scripture in the Dao Sect was merely inferior to the ancestor!
If the Spirit of the Grand Dao stood on Ye Xuan's side, then it would be extremely disadvantageous to the Dao Sect!
Everyone was looking at Ye Xuan.
The Dao Scripture in Ye Xuan's hand gradually emanated a ray of white light, and then it floated up into the sky.
Ye Xuan gazed at the white light in the sky, and a shadow was gradually condensing within it!
The Spirit of the Grand Dao!
Not far away, the expressions of countless experts from the Dao Sect became excited!
It was the Spirit of the Grand Dao!
After the ancestor of the Dao Sect left, the Spirit of the Grand Dao had become the symbol of the Dao Sect. Unfortunately, internal strife had caused the Dao Scripture to be split into nine, and the Spirit of the Grand Dao had fallen into deep slumber.
Yet now, the Spirit of the Grand Dao was finally about to appear!
Right at this moment, the Dao Scripture in front of Ye Xuan suddenly started burning!
Ye Xuan was stunned!
Everyone in the surroundings was stunned!
What's going on?
Ye Xuan grabbed at the burning Dao Scripture with his right hand. However, a powerful force sent him flying thousands of feet away!
Ye Xuan was shocked. He looked at the Dao Scripture again. At this time, the complete Dao Scripture directly transformed into a flame and disappeared into the end of the starry sky!
Gone!
Everyone in the surroundings was stunned.
That's it?
Fourth Dao Brother and Second Dao Brother looked at each other with a trace of doubt in their eyes!
What was going on?
Ye Xuan was also a little confused at this moment!
That's it?
Where was the Spirit of the Great Dao?
As if he had thought of something, he looked at the Dao Second Brother in the distance. In the next moment, he turned and ran!
His speed was very fast. In the blink of an eye, he disappeared into the horizon of the starry sky!
Seeing that Ye Xuan was running away, Second Elder Dao said fiercely, "Chase him!"
As soon as he finished speaking, he was the first to rush out.
At this moment, he had no time to care about the Dao Scripture. The most important thing was to deal with Ye Xuan first.
In the starry sky, Ye Xuan ran all the way. Behind him, there were nearly seven hundred Consolidation Realm experts!
This time, the Dao Sect was really going to risk their lives with him!
At this moment, Second Dao Brother suddenly stopped. He looked at the sword light at the end of the starry sky in the distance. "Let's go to the Fifth Dimension!"
After saying that, he turned and left.
Chasing after Ye Xuan like this was too much of a waste of time!
If they went directly to the Fifth Dimension, Ye Xuan would definitely return to the Fifth Dimension!
Soon, Second Dao Brother and the others went straight to the Fifth Dimension!
In the distant starry sky, Ye Xuan stopped. He looked in the direction where Second Dao Brother and the others left. It was the direction of the Fifth Dimension.
Ye Xuan opened his palm, and a voice transmission talisman suddenly disappeared. After a moment, the space in front of him gradually trembled, and a voice came out.
After a moment of silence, Ye Xuan turned and disappeared into the distance.
...
In the Fifth Dimension.
Inside the Sword Hall.
Knowing Destiny sat cross-legged on the ground. In front of her, there were nine scrolls. They were the nine scrolls of the Dao Scripture!
However, these nine scrolls were all copied and not the real thing.
In front of Ye Zhiming was Nian Nian.
Nian Nian held a fish in her left hand and a stick of tanghulu in her right. She would occasionally lick the fish, and then the tanghulu …
At this moment, Ye Zhiming suddenly looked at Nian Nian. "Nian Nian!"
Nian Nian looked at Ye Zhiming. "Sister Zhiming, what's wrong?"
Ye Zhiming smiled. "Nian Nian, tell me honestly. Have you recovered your memories?"
Nian Nian blinked. "Recovered my memories?"
Ye Zhiming nodded.
Nian Nian shook her head. "No!
I can't remember a lot of things! "
Ye Zhiming was silent.
Nian Nian didn't look like she was lying!
However, her intuition told her that Nian Nian was becoming more and more different.
At this moment, Nian Nian suddenly raised her head. The next moment, she looked at Ye Zhiming and smiled. "Sister Zhiming, I'm going to play!"
After saying that, she got up and left.
In the hall, Ye Zhiming frowned. She chased after her, but Nian Nian was already gone!
Gone!
Ye Zhiming was stunned.
...
In the sky above Dao City, a woman in a dark green dress stood quietly in the clouds. Behind her was the Holy Leader!
At this moment, the woman suddenly turned her head. Not far away, the clouds parted and a woman slowly walked over!
It was Nian Nian!
The woman looked at Nian Nian and smiled.
Nian Nian walked to the woman's side. Neither of them said a word and just stood there quietly.
At this moment, at the end of the starry sky, a powerful aura swept over!
The experts of the Dao Sect had arrived!
Nian Nian licked the candied hawthorn but still did not say a word.
The woman glanced at the candied hawthorn in Nian Nian's hand and smiled. "Candied hawthorn … There's a little white guy who especially likes to eat candied hawthorn. There's also that little girl. Both of them really like to eat candied hawthorn!"
Nian Nian continued to lick the candied hawthorn without saying a word.
The woman smiled. "Are you afraid that I'll attack, so you came to watch me?"
Nian Nian glanced at the woman. "Do you dare to attack?"
The woman shook her head. "I don't dare."
As she said that, she looked at Nian Nian and smiled. "You don't dare either!"
Nian Nian shrugged and continued to lick the candied hawthorn.
The woman did not say anything else. She looked into the distance. At this moment, Second Brother Dao and the others had already entered the starry sky of the Fifth Dimension.
It had to be said that the difference in strength between the Fifth Dimension and the Dao Sect was huge!
Below Dao City, Bai Dizi looked at Second Brother Dao and the others in the sky with a calm expression.
He had already expected this day!
Behind him were Li Shanshui and the others.
They were all super experts from the Whirling World!
Li Shanshui looked at Second Brother Dao and the others in the sky with a calm expression. In fact, he was not panicking at all.
Why?
Those who had not come into contact with the white-robed woman would not know how terrifying she was!
Back then, didn't the Xuanhuan Sect think that they could defeat Ye Xuan just like the current Dao Sect?
But in the end?
Not only was Li Shanshui not panicking, but the experts from the Whirling World were also very calm.
In fact, they were a little uneasy at the beginning because there were too many experts!
But as long as they thought of the two women, they would calm down.
Those were two immortals!
In the sky.
Second Brother Dao looked down. Compared to the Dao Sect, the strength of the Fifth Dimension was indeed very weak, but he did not dare to underestimate them.
At this moment, a man suddenly appeared not far in front of Second Brother Dao and the others.
The person who had come was Ye Xuan!
Seeing Ye Xuan, Bai Dizi's expression relaxed slightly. He was not afraid that Ye Xuan would run away, but mainly because he felt more at ease with this guy here.
Second Brother Dao looked at Ye Xuan. "Ye Xuan, where are your people?"
Ye Xuan smiled. He did not answer Second Brother Dao, but turned to look at the Consolidation Realm experts in the field. "Everyone, I know that many of you are not from the Dao Sect, but because you want to get some benefits, you came to kill me, Ye Xuan!
I have no grievances with any of you. If you leave now, nothing will happen to me. "
In the field, the Consolidation Realm experts looked at Ye Xuan without saying a word, and no one left.
Now that the Dao Sect had an overwhelming advantage, and the benefits were at their fingertips, why would they leave?
Seeing that no one left, Ye Xuan smiled, then looked at Second Brother Dao. "Second Brother, do you want to fight one-on-one?"
Second Brother!
The expressions of everyone in the field became a little strange!
Second Brother Dao looked at Ye Xuan. "Ye Xuan, I will not give you any chance!
Since your people will not appear, then you and your Fifth Dimension will die together! "
As his voice fell, he suddenly said, "Attack!"
As soon as the words fell, more than twenty shadows suddenly rushed straight down from the sky.
All of them were experts at the peak of the Consolidation Realm, and their auras were infinitely close to the half-step Divine Realm!
Dao Guards!
These were twenty people carefully cultivated by the Dao Sect, and their strength far exceeded that of ordinary Consolidation Realm experts!
The target of these twenty people was Ye Xuan!
Fourth Brother Dao and Second Brother Dao did not make a move. They were waiting to fight whoever saved Ye Xuan!
Below, Ye Xuan's expression was calm. At this moment, Li Shanshui suddenly appeared in front of Ye Xuan. Ye Xuan looked at Li Shanshui, and Li Shanshui smiled awkwardly. "Young Master Ye, let my Xuanhuan Sect perform!"
Ye Xuan asked, "Are you sure?"
Li Shanshui said seriously, "Of course!"
Ye Xuan nodded and made an inviting gesture.
Li Shanshui raised his head and looked at the twenty people rushing down with a calm expression. He opened his palm, and a black wooden seal suddenly flew out from his palm. "Ancestor Summon!"
Ancestor Summon!
On the side, Ye Xuan's expression became a little strange!
In the past, it was others who summoned their ancestor to beat him, but this was the first time someone summoned their ancestor to protect him …
In fact, Li Shanshui's heart was also a little complicated.
This could be said to be the Xuanhuan Sect's last life-saving trump card. Previously, he wanted to use it on the white-robed woman, but he was not sure at that time. After seeing the miserable state of the Xuanhuan Sect after summoning their ancestor, he was even more glad that he did not summon their ancestor.
The reason why he summoned their ancestor now was to show off. Otherwise, the Xuanhuan Sect would not have a sense of existence in the Fifth Dimension.
As Li Shanshui's voice fell, a black light suddenly shot up from the black wooden seal into the sky.
Boom!
A powerful aura directly forced the twenty people from the Dao Sect to stop in place. Then, a middle-aged man in a black robe appeared in the sky.
The Xuanhuan Sect's Patriarch!
Seeing the Xuanhuan Sect's Patriarch, Second Brother Dao frowned!
It was just a split soul!
However, this middle-aged man was once an expert at the peak of the God State!
At this moment, the current patriarch of the Xiao Clan, Xiao Kuo, suddenly roared, "Ancestor Summon!"
As his voice fell, he directly threw out a black chess piece, which turned into a black light and shot into the sky …
At the same time, the current dean of the Dao Returning Courtyard, Qiu Min, suddenly said, "Ancestor, please …"
As his voice fell, a white light shot up into the sky …
On the other side, Xuanji Sect's Sect Master Gu Wuchao was a little embarrassed.
In the past, the Xuanji Sect had already summoned their ancestor once. Now, they could not summon it!
What should they do?
They could not lose face!
They had to put in some effort, right?
Gu Wuchao seemed to have thought of something. He suddenly pointed at Second Brother Dao and roared, "Second Brother Dao, I'll screw your ancestor!"
Everyone: "…"
.....







Chapter 1467
Hearing Gu Wuchao's words, the corners of Ye Xuan's mouth twitched.
This guy was actually cursing!
In the field, some experts also looked at Gu Wuchao with strange expressions.
After all, this guy was still a Consolidation Realm expert!
How could he curse like this …
At this moment, Gu Wuchao suddenly walked to Ye Xuan's side, bowed slightly, and then respectfully retreated behind Ye Xuan.
Ye Xuan: "…"
In the field, everyone looked at Ye Xuan.
Obviously, this was Ye Xuan's instigation!
In the sky, the Second Dao Master's gaze also fell on Ye Xuan. "Ye Xuan, you don't have the demeanor of an expert at all!"
Ye Xuan turned his head and glanced at Gu Wuchao. Gu Wuchao smiled awkwardly. "I live and die with the Five-Dimensional Universe!"
Ye Xuan was speechless. He looked up at the sky. At this time, there were three super experts in the sky. They were the black-robed middle-aged man from the Xuanao Sect, the ancestor of the Xiao Clan, and the ancestor of the Dao Returning Academy.
The ancestor of the Xiao Clan was an old man in a gray robe. His eyes were like knives, giving off a strong sense of oppression.
The ancestor of the Dao Returning Academy wore a brown robe. His long hair draped over his shoulders, and he held a black ancient book in his hand.
The ancestors of three super forces!
When the three appeared, the expressions of the Second Dao Master and the others gradually became solemn!
The Whirling World was not a low-level world. In this world, there were also many amazing experts!
Just these three people in front of them were at least in the God Realm, and they were definitely not ordinary God Realm experts. They were even above the God Realm.
Although this kind of existence could not compare to the ancestor of the Dao Sect, this kind of existence belonged to the top of this world.
They could not be underestimated!
In the sky, the Xuanao Sect's ancestor looked around. Finally, he looked at the Sect Master of the Xuanao Sect, Li Shanshui. Li Shanshui hurriedly bowed respectfully.
The Xuanao Sect's ancestor said, "This is not the Whirling World!"
Li Shanshui said respectfully, "Ancestor, the Xuanao Sect will advance and retreat with Young Master Ye!"
Advance and retreat together!
The Patriarch of the Xuanxuan Sect looked at Ye Xuan. "Him?"
Li Shanshui quickly nodded.
The gazes of the Desolate Clan's Ancestor and the Dao Returnance Courtyard's Ancestor descended onto Ye Xuan.
Ye Xuan cupped his fists at the Patriarch of Xuanao Sect.
The Old Ancestor of the Xuanao Sect looked at Ye Xuan. Gradually, a hint of surprise flashed through his eyes. "Your bloodline …"
Ye Xuan opened his palm, and the blood in his body began to tremble.
When the power of Ye Xuan's bloodline emerged, the surprise in the eyes of the Patriarch of Xuanao Sect gradually turned into shock!
On the other side, the Patriarch of the Xiao Clan and the Patriarch of the Dao Returning Academy were also shocked!
The same was true for the surrounding Consolidation Realm experts!
In fact, Ye Xuan's bloodline power had always been growing. His current bloodline power was many times stronger than before.
As for why it kept growing, Ye Xuan was not particularly clear. According to his guess, it might have something to do with madness.
The crazier one was, the stronger the bloodline power!
The Patriarch of the Xuanxuan Sect looked at Ye Xuan. "He's indeed not simple!"
As he spoke, he looked at Li Shanshui. "You bet the future of the Xuanxuan Sect on him?"
Li Shanshui nodded.
The Patriarch of the Xuanxuan Sect asked, "No regrets?"
Li Shanshui shook his head. "No regrets!"
The Patriarch of the Xuanxuan Sect nodded slightly. Just as he was about to speak, the Second Brother suddenly said, "Sir, we are from the Dao Sect!"
The Dao Sect!
Hearing this, the Patriarch of the Xuanxuan Sect looked at the Second Brother and said with a smile, "Dao Sect!
Are you threatening me? "
The Second Brother was expressionless. "I just want to remind you that this matter has nothing to do with the Xuanxuan Sect. Why do you want your descendants to be involved in this struggle?
If you let your descendants leave now, the Dao Sect will let bygones be bygones! "
The Patriarch of the Xuanxuan Sect shook his head and smiled. "May I ask, are you in charge of the Dao Sect now?"
The Second Brother said, "Yes!"
The Patriarch of the Xuanxuan Sect shook his head. "The Dao Sect's Patriarch is also a senior I respect, but why is the disciple he chose so stupid?"
The Second Brother looked at the Patriarch of the Xuanxuan Sect with a calm expression. "It seems that you are determined to make the Xuanxuan Sect an enemy of the Dao Sect!"
The Patriarch of the Xuanxuan Sect said with a smile, "Just now, my descendant told me that this Young Master Ye has gathered all nine Dao Scriptures, so your Dao Sect wants to kill him, right?"
The Second Brother said calmly, "So what?"
"Idiot!"
The smile on the Patriarch of the Xuanxuan Sect's face disappeared. "I can tell at a glance that you are an idiot, but I didn't expect you to be this stupid!"
Everyone was speechless.
The Second Brother narrowed his eyes and slowly clenched his right hand.
The Patriarch of the Xuanxuan Sect said, "What kind of person is the Dao Sect's Patriarch?
He left behind the Dao Scriptures, but the Great Dao Spirit doesn't recognize you as its master. Have you ever thought about why?
And these nine Dao Scriptures have fallen into the hands of this Young Master Ye. Have you ever thought about why? "
The Second Brother was silent.
The Patriarch of the Xuanxuan Sect continued, "This Young Master Ye has the legendary Cause of Misfortune, but he is able to live until now. What does this prove?
It proves that someone is forcibly resisting the Cause of Misfortune for him!
In my opinion, someone who can do this will not lose to your Dao Sect's Patriarch!
And your Dao Sect's nine Dao Scriptures have fallen into the hands of Young Master Ye. Don't you think this may also be an arrangement of your Dao Sect's Patriarch? "
The Second Brother said in a deep voice, "Absolutely impossible!
Master will never choose him! "
The Patriarch of the Xuanxuan Sect chuckled. "Could he have chosen you?"
The Second Brother stared at the Patriarch of the Xuanxuan Sect. "Master will never choose him!"
The Patriarch of the Xuanxuan Sect smiled. "Second Brother, you are the disciple of the Dao Sect's Patriarch. Why are you so bad?
Look at you now. There is only hatred in your eyes and no reason. You have cultivated to this level. Logically speaking, your temperament should not be bad, but why are you blinded by hatred now? "
The Second Brother was expressionless. "Are you teaching me how to be a person?"
The Patriarch of the Xuanxuan Sect laughed. "Teach you how to be a person?
Second Brother, to say that you are stupid is an insult to the word 'stupid'.
The reason why I'm talking so much nonsense with you is that what I learned is also derived from the Dao Scriptures. The Dao Sect's Patriarch is someone I respect. I don't want the Dao Sect he established to be destroyed by you!
I just didn't expect your temperament to be so bad.
A person like you leading the Dao Sect is not only the sorrow of the Dao Sect, but also the sorrow of the Dao Sect's Patriarch! "
At this moment, the Fourth Brother of the Dao Sect suddenly laughed. "The reason why you said this is because you think our Dao Sect is inferior to Young Master Ye, right?"
The Patriarch of the Xuanxuan Sect looked at the Fourth Brother of the Dao Sect and said with a smile, "It seems that you still don't understand what the Cause of Misfortune is … No, I should say that you have become arrogant!
However, it's very sad that you don't have the strength to be arrogant, but you think you have the strength. Why?
Because you think you are the disciples of the Dao Sect's Patriarch, but you have never thought that the reason why the Dao Sect is strong is not because of you, but because of the Dao Sect's Patriarch!
There is a difference between a Dao Sect with the Dao Sect's Patriarch and a Dao Sect without him. Understand? "
The Fourth Taoist smiled and said, "I would like to know if your strength is as sharp as your mouth!"
The Patriarch of the Xuanxuan Sect roared with laughter, and then he suddenly vanished on the spot.
In the distance, the Fourth Brother's expression changed abruptly, and he suddenly smashed his fist forward!
Rumble!
Along with a shocking explosion, the Fourth Brother of the Dao Sect retreated explosively, and he retreated thousands of meters into the starry sky!
The expressions of everyone here changed!
He's so strong?
Ye Xuan was quite shocked as well. Even though the Patriarch of the Dao Sect was only a wisp of his soul, he was actually so strong!
In the distance, the Second Brother of the Dao Sect stared fixedly at the Patriarch of the Xuanxuan Sect, and he was quite shocked as well. A wisp of the soul of a Godrank Realm expert was actually so strong!
The Patriarch of the Xuanxuan Sect gazed at the Fourth Brother in the distance and said with a smile, "Looks like it's always the fist that's stronger in any era!"
As soon as he finished speaking, he vanished on the spot once more.
The pupils of the Fourth Brother of the Dao Sect suddenly constricted, and he swiftly raised his arms.
A fist seal arrived.
Bang!
The Fourth Brother of the Dao Sect was instantly blasted away, and he flew for thousands of meters. Not only that, but his body even split apart!
His current body wasn't a Dao Physique any longer because his Dao Physique had been shattered by Ye Ling. So, his current body was extremely weak!
The Patriarch of the Xuanxuan Sect gazed at the Fourth Brother of the Dao Sect and said with a smile, "I've noticed that you can't reason with some people because if you do, they'll look at you like an idiot!"
As soon as he finished speaking, he vanished on the spot once more!
Right at this moment, the Second Brother of the Dao Sect suddenly vanished on the spot!
Rumble!
The space in the sky suddenly collapsed, and then a figure retreated explosively for over 1km!
It was the Second Brother of the Dao Sect!
After he stopped moving, he gazed at the Patriarch of the Xuanxuan Sect, "From today onward, the Xuanxuan Sect will cease to exist in this world!"
The Patriarch of the Xuanxuan Sect roared with laughter, "A little Second Brother of the Dao Sect is laughable!
You're being used as a pawn by others, yet you don't even realize it. How laughable! "
The Second Brother frowned slightly, "What do you mean?"
The Patriarch of the Xuanxuan Sect blinked, "I'm not telling you!
You idiot!
Haha … "
After saying that, he turned to look at Ye Xuan below, "Young Master Ye, I've sent a wisp of my soul to help you today. I hope that Young Master Ye will treat the Xuanxuan Sect well in the future. The Xuanxuan Sect doesn't seek to be invincible in the world, but to be passed down from generation to generation."
Ye Xuan bowed slightly, "I, Ye Xuan, will forever remember the kindness of the Xuanxuan Sect!"
The Patriarch of the Xuanxuan Sect smiled and said, "With Young Master Ye's words, I'm relieved!"
After saying that, he glanced at the clouds somewhere. "Young Master Ye, remember, not all of your enemies are as stupid as this Second Brother."
As soon as he finished speaking, he turned and rushed toward the Second Brother of the Dao Sect.
Seeing the Patriarch of the Xuanxuan Sect rushing over, the Second Brother's face became ferocious, "Kill!
If Ye Xuan is destroyed today, you can take anything in the Fifth Dimension and the Whirling World! "
After saying that, he rushed over.
The rest of the Consolidation Realm experts from the Dao Sects also rushed over!
However, some of the Consolidation Realm experts who did not belong to the Dao Sects were a little hesitant … But there were also some who directly rushed over.
Below, the Ancestor of the Xiao clan and the Ancestor of the Dao Returning Academy looked at each other. The Ancestor of the Xiao clan turned to look at Ye Xuan, "What do you think?"
The Ancestor of the Dao Returning Academy smiled and said, "I was hesitating just now. After all, it's the Dao Sects, but now it seems … the person in charge of the Dao Sects is too stupid!
If we help this kind of person, I'm afraid our Dao Returning Academy will be doomed.
So, let's choose this Young Master Ye! "
After saying that, he rushed out.
The Ancestor of the Xiao clan smiled and said, "Why did the Dao Sects choose such an idiot to be in charge?
This IQ is worse than the pigs I raised back then! "
After saying that, he also rushed out.
On the other side, in the clouds, the mysterious woman beside Nian Nian smiled and said, "The Sect Master of the Xuanxuan Sect has discovered us!
Interesting! "
Nian Nian licked the tanghulu and did not speak.
The mysterious woman looked at Nian Nian, "Do you want to kill me?"
Nian Nian nodded.
The mysterious woman gently stroked the hair beside her ear with her jade-like hand and the corners of her mouth curled up slightly, "No one can kill me under three strikes!"
Nian Nian licked the tanghulu. "Can you take one strike from the plain-dressed woman?"
The mysterious woman's smile gradually disappeared. After a moment, she looked at Nian Nian, "If you continue to chat like this, I won't be chatting with you anymore!"

Chapter 1468
In the sky above Dao City, a great battle had begun!
Although the Fifth Dimension was at an absolute disadvantage in terms of numbers, with the addition of the Xuan Yao Sect's Patriarch, the Xiao Clan's Patriarch, and the Dao Return Courtyard's Patriarch, the situation was instantly different!
The Xuan Yao Sect's Patriarch was holding off Dao Lao Er and Dao Lao Si by himself, while the Xiao Clan's Patriarch and the Dao Return Courtyard's Patriarch were directly suppressing nearly two hundred Consolidation Realm experts. Although it was only a wisp of their soul, the difference between these Consolidation Realm experts and them was too great!
However, as they made their moves, their wisps of soul became more and more illusory!
Below, Bai Dizi suddenly said, "Make your move!"
As his voice fell, all the Consolidation Realm experts of the Fifth Dimension soared into the sky. As the experts of the Fifth Dimension made their move, twenty black-clothed men suddenly rushed into the crowd of Dao Sect experts. Then, bloody heads flew into the sky.
Assassins!
These twenty people were the twenty super assassins that Ye Xuan had borrowed from Xuan City!
Ye Xuan did not make a move. His eyes were fixed on Dao Lao Er.
At this time, Dao Lao Er and Dao Lao Si were being suppressed by the Xuan Yao Sect's Patriarch!
Dao Lao Er did not focus all his energy on the Xuan Yao Sect's Patriarch. He had been guarding against Ye Xuan!
He had not forgotten Ye Xuan's sword!
That sword had almost killed him in an instant!
Therefore, until now, he had been distracted by guarding against Ye Xuan to ensure that when Ye Xuan made his move, he would be the first to react!
However, Ye Xuan did not make a move. Instead, he just looked at him, which put a great deal of pressure on him!
At this time, Ye Xuan suddenly laughed. "Second Brother, I'm going to make my move!"
He was going to make his move!
Dao Lao Er, who was fighting with the Xuan Yao Sect's Patriarch, suddenly changed his expression. He glanced at Ye Xuan, who was looking at him with a smile.
Dao Lao Er did not dare to be too distracted. He withdrew his gaze because the Xuan Yao Sect's Patriarch in front of him was very powerful.
Just as Second Brother Dao withdrew his gaze, Ye Xuan suddenly said, "Second Brother Dao, I'm really going to make a move!"
Second Elder Dao suddenly turned his head to look at Ye Xuan. Ye Xuan blinked and said, "Don't worry, I'm about to make my move!"
"Ye Xuan!" the second Daoist said fiercely.
Ye Xuan grinned. "Come and hit me!"
Just as the Second Elder was about to speak, a shadow suddenly rushed in front of him.
Second Elder Dao's pupils suddenly shrank, and his arms suddenly moved forward to block.
Boom!
The Second Daoist was sent flying thousands of feet away!
At this moment, Ye Xuan suddenly disappeared. Sensing this, the Second Elder's pupils suddenly shrank. He waved his right hand, and a black round shield appeared in front of him. This black round shield was specially kept for Ye Xuan!
However, he quickly noticed that the target of Ye Xuan's attack wasn't him!
It was Fourth Elder Dao!
When he noticed this, Second Elder Dao suddenly turned his head to look at Fourth Elder Dao, who was not far away. His eyes almost popped out of their sockets. "Little …"
Before his voice died away —
Swoosh!
A ray of sword light suddenly pierced through Fourth Elder Dao's eyebrows!
Without his Taoist Body, Fourth Elder Dao's eyebrows were directly pierced by Ye Xuan's sword. Fourth Elder Dao's body froze in the air. His eyes were wide open and full of disbelief!
He didn't expect that Ye Xuan's target wasn't Fourth Elder Dao, but him. Of course, he didn't expect that the sword would be so fast that he didn't even have time to react!
In front of Fourth Elder Dao, Ye Xuan held the sword in his right hand and pulled it out little by little. Between Fourth Elder Dao's eyebrows, blood spurted out.
Second Elder Dao stared at Ye Xuan. He was about to make a move when the Patriarch of Xuanao Sect appeared in front of him again. Second Elder Dao suddenly turned his head and said fiercely, "Get lost!"
As soon as his voice fell, he suddenly …
He punched out!
Taoist Fist!
A punch with all his strength!
Rumble!
The surrounding starry sky trembled violently. Second Elder Dao retreated hundreds of feet, and the Patriarch of Xuanao Sect also retreated hundreds of feet. After stopping, he didn't make another move because his soul was already very transparent and was about to disappear!
Seeing this, Second Elder Dao was about to take the initiative to attack, but at this time, Ye Xuan suddenly appeared in front of the Patriarch of Xuanao Sect. Second Elder Dao narrowed his eyes and turned to look in the direction of Fourth Elder Dao. At this moment, Fourth Elder Dao's soul had been absorbed by Ye Xuan's sword, leaving only his physical body.
His soul had been destroyed!
Seeing this, Second Elder Dao's face became extremely ferocious. He turned to look at Ye Xuan and said, "Ye Xuan, my Taoist Sect is absolutely irreconcilable with you!"
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "Don't you think it's stupid to say that now?"
Behind Ye Xuan, the Patriarch of Xuanao Sect suddenly said, "Young Friend, this strand of my soul is about to vanish!"
Ye Xuan turned to look at the Patriarch of Xuanao Sect, cupped his fists, and said, "I, Ye Xuan, will remember Senior's help!"
The Patriarch of Xuanao Sect smiled and said, "Just take care of my Xuanao Sect!"
Ye Xuan nodded and said, "Of course!"
The Patriarch of Xuanao Sect turned to look at the clouds again, and then his body gradually became illusory.
Ye Xuan glanced in the direction the Patriarch of Xuanao Sect was looking, but he couldn't see anything!
Ye Xuan thought for a moment and said, "Senior, did you see something?"
The Patriarch of Xuanao Sect was about to speak when he suddenly vanished without a trace!
Ye Xuan's eyes instantly narrowed when he saw this!
Someone had forcefully wiped out the Patriarch of Xuanao Sect!
Who was it?
Ye Xuan turned to look at the clouds, but there was nothing there!
There were actually two women standing above the clouds, but Ye Xuan couldn't see them!
At this moment, Nian Nian suddenly said, "There should be a backup plan."
The mysterious woman smiled and said, "Of course!"
Nian Nian nodded. "I'm looking forward to it!"
The mysterious woman smiled and said, "I'm looking forward to it as well!"
In the distance, Ye Xuan retracted his gaze and turned to look around. The Xiao clan's Patriarch and the Dao Returning Monastery's Patriarch were still there. With the two of them working together, they had killed more than fifty Consolidation Realm experts!
Their strength was slightly inferior to the Patriarch of Xuanao Sect!
At this moment, their strands of soul were becoming more and more illusory!
At the sight of this, Ye Xuan knew he could not delay any longer!
Ye Xuan opened his palm, and the Supreme Sword appeared in his hand. In the next moment, he vanished on the spot.
In the distance, the Second Elder's eyes narrowed slightly as he blasted a punch forward!
Bang!
A wisp of sword light was forced to a stop!
In front of the Second Elder, Ye Xuan stomped his right foot, and the Dao Sword in his hand suddenly turned into a technological form. In the next moment, his strength increased explosively!
Rumble!
The Second Elder was knocked back hundreds of feet!
Meanwhile, Ye Xuan didn't attack the Second Elder again. Instead, he turned into a sword light and disappeared into the distance.
Chi!
In the distant crowd, the head of a Dao Sect Consolidation Realm expert flew into the air.
Instant Kill Sword!
Ordinary Consolidation Realm experts had no way of resisting Ye Xuan's Instant Kill Sword!
Massacre!
When Ye Xuan entered the crowd, it was simply a massacre!
Seeing this scene, the Second Elder's expression turned extremely ugly. He was just about to make a move when Ye Xuan suddenly turned around and slashed at him!
The Second Elder didn't dodge and directly punched out!
Dao Fist!
As for Ye Xuan's sword, it was a Dao Sword!
Boom!
With a loud explosion, the two of them retreated rapidly. Ye Xuan retreated a hundred feet, and the Second Elder also retreated nearly a hundred feet!
The two of them were evenly matched!
When Ye Xuan had stopped, he raised his hand and brandished his sword at the right side.
Instant Kill Sword!
Chi!
A hundred feet to the right, the head of a Consolidation Realm expert flew into the air!
Instant kill!
In the field, the Consolidation Realm experts who came to help the Dao Sect were finally afraid!
Because up until now, more than two hundred Consolidation Realm experts had died on the battlefield!
Most of them were killed by the Xiao Clan's Patriarch and the Dao Returning Academy's Patriarch, and some were killed by the twenty super assassins from Xuan City!
As for the elites of the Dao Sect, they had always been restrained by the Dao Returning Academy's Patriarch!
In fact, without these three Patriarchs, the situation in the Fifth Dimension would have become very bad!
These three people were equivalent to hundreds of Consolidation Realm experts!
After all, they were once all-powerful figures. As long as they did not encounter experts like the white-robed woman, even their split souls were not something ordinary people could fight against.
Now, Ye Xuan was also anxious. Because once the Xiao Clan's Patriarch and the Dao Returning Academy's Patriarch disappeared, the situation in the Fifth Dimension would be very disadvantageous.
Therefore, he had to end the battle while the two of them were still around!
The Second Elder also understood this, and what he had to do was to stall them. As long as he could stall until the Xiao Clan's Patriarch and the Dao Returning Academy's Patriarch disappeared, the situation would be reversed!
The Dao Sect still had a chance to win!
At this moment, Ye Xuan looked at the Xiao Clan's Patriarch in the distance. "Senior, can you help me stall the Second Elder?"
In the distance, the Xiao Clan's Patriarch stopped and turned to look at the Second Elder. "Fifteen minutes!"
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "That's enough!"
As soon as he finished speaking, he disappeared on the spot.
In the distance, the Second Elder was about to attack when the Xiao Clan's Patriarch appeared in front of him. The Second Elder said in a deep voice, "Sir, aren't you afraid that the Xiao Clan will be doomed?"
The Xiao Clan's Patriarch shook his head and smiled. "You're still threatening me now!
You're too stupid! "
After saying that, he disappeared on the spot!
In the distance, the Second Elder threw a punch.
Boom!
The surrounding space shook as if there was an earthquake!
The Xiao Clan's Patriarch was pushed back by the punch. After stopping, the Xiao Clan's Patriarch shook his head. "It's just a split soul after all!"
After saying that, he rushed out.
Fifteen minutes!
He only needed to buy fifteen minutes for Ye Xuan!
After Ye Xuan rushed into the group of people in the distance, rays of sword gleams appeared, and each sword gleam took a life!
Instant Kill!
In addition to his Dao Body, ordinary Consolidation Realm experts would not be able to cause fatal damage to him.
In a short while, Ye Xuan had killed more than ten Consolidation Realm experts. Seeing this, some of the Consolidation Realm experts who came to help the Dao Sect chose to retreat.
They were here to make a fortune, not to risk their lives!
Especially now that the Dao Sect was at a disadvantage!
As those people left, the Dao Sect's situation became worse and worse.
At this moment, Nian Nian, who was in the clouds, suddenly raised her head and looked at the sky. In the next moment, she looked at Ye Xuan's position. There, an afterimage silently appeared.
Ye Xuan suddenly turned around and slashed with his sword!
Boom!
The sword gleam shattered, and Ye Xuan retreated thousands of meters away!
The afterimage waved its right hand, and the split souls of the Xiao Clan's Patriarch and the Dao Returning Courtyard's Patriarch were directly wiped out!
The scene became silent!
.....







Chapter 1469
Everyone was looking at the afterimage, which was gradually becoming more and more solid.
It was a woman in white, holding a jade flute in her hand.
Seeing this woman, Ye Xuan's expression gradually became serious!
His opponent's attack just now had directly shattered his Dao Body!
A Godly State expert!
A true Godly State expert!
In the distance, the Dao Sect experts became excited!
Dao Sect's Third Brother!
Third Miss!
She was once the Dao Sect's Patriarch's proudest disciple. She only liked to cultivate and hunt for novelty, never getting involved in the internal affairs of the Dao Sect!
Back then, she was actually the most likely to become the Dao Sect's leader because she was the Dao Sect's Patriarch's proudest disciple. Most importantly, she was the most talented among the four disciples.
Unfortunately, after the Dao Sect's Patriarch disappeared, she only came back to take a look before leaving. Once she left, she never returned!
Seeing Third Miss, Second Brother also heaved a huge sigh of relief!
She finally came back!
If she didn't come back, even if the Dao Sect won today, it would be a pyrrhic victory!
Moreover, the Dao Sect was very likely to lose!
Because if no one restrained Ye Xuan, with Ye Xuan's strength, he would probably be able to destroy all the Dao Sect's Consolidation Realm experts!
Second Brother walked to Third Miss and stared at Ye Xuan, "Third Junior Sister, I'll hold Ye Xuan back. Leave the rest to me!"
Saying that, he was about to make a move. At this moment, Third Miss suddenly said, "Second Senior Brother, I'm very disappointed!"
Second Brother looked at Third Miss and Third Miss shook her head, "Very disappointed!"
Second Brother said in a deep voice, "What do you mean!"
Third Miss did not answer Second Brother. She turned to look at the Dao Sect experts, "You guys also disappointed me!"
Everyone was silent.
Third Miss looked at Second Brother, "Do you think the Dao Sect can win today?"
Second Brother said in a deep voice, "If Junior Sister is willing to help, can we lose?"
Third Miss shook her head, "Second Senior Brother, you need to calm down. Calm down!"
Second Brother narrowed his eyes, "What do you mean?"
Third Miss looked at Second Brother, "As far as I know, you should have investigated Ye Xuan!
Then you should know that he is someone who has the cause of disaster, right? "
Second Brother said in a deep voice, "Yes!
But so what? "
The Third Young Lady frowned. "So what?
Ask yourself, can you resist this Cause of Disaster? "
The Second Daoist was silent.
The Third Young Lady continued, "Let's not talk about the cause of this disaster. Let's talk about this person's bloodline. Have you ever seen such a powerful bloodline?"
The Second Daoist was silent.
The third young lady continued, "The most important thing is that the white-robed woman has seen the person behind this person before. Let me ask, when the white-robed woman was in the Whirling Sect, she summoned the Xuanji Sect's ancestor, but what was the result?
In the end, the Profound Secrets Sect submitted to Ye Xuan.
Yet, he was injured by a wisp of the Xuanhuan Sect's ancestor's soul. Tell me, can he be compared to her? "
The Second Elder was silent, and his face was gloomy.
The Third Young Lady shook her head. "When Master was still alive, Dao Sect was the number one power in the world. However, Master often said that there is always someone better than you. No one is truly invincible. There is no strongest, only stronger!
Second Senior Brother didn't remember what he said at all! "
The Second Daoist spoke fiercely, "It's impossible for there to be a power stronger than my Dao Sect in this world!"
The Third Young Lady sighed in a low voice. "The reason why the Dao Sect is strong isn't because of us, it's because of Master!
But now, Master is gone!
Understand? "
The Second Daoist was slightly mad. He pointed angrily at Ye Xuan and said, "He's a true expert at the peak of the Godrank Realm. So long as he attacks, then Ye Xuan will definitely die today!
Why didn't he attack!? "
The Third Young Lady gazed at the Second Daoist. After a short moment, she shook her head.
"I gave him the opportunity, but I didn't cherish it!"
As soon as she finished speaking, she opened her palm, and an ink colored ruler suddenly appeared in her hand.
The Daoist Ruler!
The expressions of the experts from the Dao Sect instantly changed when they saw it!
It was a sacred artifact of the Dao Sect that was only inferior to the Dao Scriptures. It was used by the Dao Sect's ancestor to discipline his disciples, and it contained the Dao Laws that the Dao Sect's ancestor had personally set up within it.
The Second Daoist's expression changed as well, and he took a few steps back. All those years ago, he'd been struck by the Daoist Ruler, and it was already traumatized by it!
The Third Young Lady suddenly waved her right hand, and a ruler image flew out ….
Bang!
The Second Daoist was struck by the ruler image, and his skin and flesh split open while blood sprayed!
His invincible Dao Physique was as weak as paper before the Daoist Ruler!
Moreover, a mysterious force had directly restrained the Second Daoist, causing him to be unable to move at all!
Ye Xuan's eyelids twitched when he witnessed this scene. After all, he possessed the Dao Physique as well!
The Daoist Ruler seemed to be able to restrain the Dao Physique!
The Second Daoist Ruler stared fixedly at the Third Young Lady, "Third Young Lady, what are you doing!?"
The Third Young Lady turned around to gaze at an expert from the Dao Sect, "Take him to the Dao Prison, imprison his soul, and seal his body. He can't leave the Dao Prison for 100 years."
100 years!
The old man was stunned.
The Second Daoist Ruler's expression became ferocious, "Third Young Lady, you dare!
You dare! "
The Third Young Lady gazed at the old man, "Do I have to repeat myself?"
The old man hesitated for a moment before he walked towards the Second Daoist Ruler!
The Second Daoist Ruler gazed at the Third Young Lady and roared like a wild beast, "Third Young Lady, what exactly are you afraid of!?
Who in this world can restrain him with his strength?
So long as we make a move, we'll be able to kill Ye Xuan right away and eliminate this great calamity for our Dao Sect! "
The old man who was walking towards the Second Daoist Ruler stopped when he heard this.
The Third Young Lady shook her head, "Go calm down first!"
The Second Daoist Ruler spoke ferociously, "Third Young Lady, are you worthy of Master for treating a fellow disciple like this?
I, the Second Daoist Ruler …. "
Meanwhile, the Third Young Lady suddenly swung her ruler, and a shadow of the ruler smashed against the Second Daoist Ruler.
Bang!
The Second Daoist Ruler's body instantly collapsed!
The Second Daoist Ruler was stunned!
The other experts of the Dao Sect were stunned as well!
That attack was a little too ruthless!
The Dao Physique wasn't something that could be cultivated in a short period of time!
It was destroyed just like that?
The Third Young Lady gazed at the old man, "Take him away."
The old man didn't dare hesitate at all, and he immediately left with the Second Daoist Ruler's soul. Suddenly, a ray of light flashed!
It slashed straight at the Second Daoist Ruler!
It was Ye Xuan who'd attacked!
Moreover, he was using the Soul Suppressing Sword!
However, the Soul Suppressing Sword was directly clamped by two fingers when it was still several hundred feet away from Dao Old Second!
The Third Young Lady made her move!
The Third Young Lady flicked her jade-like fingers and the Soul Suppressing Sword flew back to Ye Xuan.
Third Miss looked at Ye Xuan, "Young Master Ye, my Dao Faction's people will be dealt with by my Dao Faction. There's no need to trouble yourself!"
As she spoke, she raised her head to look at the clouds in the sky. "Both of you, our Dao Gate can't afford to play this game. We'll be leaving. I hope both of you can be magnanimous."
After saying that, she turned around and left with the experts from the Dao Sect.
Ye Xuan turned to look at the clouds. Who was that?
Above the clouds, the mysterious woman beside Nian Nian smiled and said, "Looks like this sect isn't completely useless!"
Nian Nian licked the tanghulu. "Is there still a chance?"
The mysterious woman smiled and said, "Of course!"
Nian Nian said softly, "I'm looking forward to it!
Speaking of which, is your goal to make the Dao Sect and Ye Xuan hostile? "
The mysterious woman smiled and said, "Guess.
！”
Nian Nian looked down. "I know that the Dao Sect can't kill him. The reason why I'm doing this is because I want him to destroy the Dao Sect and form a bad relationship with the Dao Sect's ancestor … I understand your intentions!
I want to magnify the Cause of Misfortune on him. "
As she spoke, she turned to look at the mysterious woman. "I want to use the Cause of Misfortune on him to kill him!"
The mysterious woman smiled. "How smart!"
Nian Nian gave the mysterious woman a thumbs up. "Very smart!"
The mysterious woman smiled. "There's nothing we can do about it!"
Nian Nian suddenly said, "I'm a little curious about your identity!"
The mysterious woman smiled and said, "In the past, I was a good person …"
As she said that, she looked into the distant horizon. "They should be here soon!"
...
Below, as the Third Miss left with the experts from the Dao Sect, some of the experts who came to help the Dao Sect felt a little awkward!
Because the Dao Sect didn't bring them along!
When they wanted to leave with the Dao Sect, the experts of the Fifth Dimension stopped them, and the Dao Sect didn't make a move!
This was a little awkward!
In fact, they wanted to escape at first, but after seeing the Third Miss, they felt that the Dao Sect was enough!
So they all stayed!
However, what they didn't expect was that the Third Miss would directly leave with the people of the Dao Sect!
They didn't want to fight anymore!
And now, Ye Xuan's people wouldn't let them go …
Ye Xuan glanced at the Consolidation Realm experts. There were still about a hundred of them.
At this time, an old man walked out. The old man hesitated for a moment and then said, "Young Master Ye, we can guarantee that we will no longer be enemies with the Fifth Dimension. I wonder if Young Master Ye can let us go?"
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "No!"
As his voice fell, the sword in his hand suddenly flew out!
Chi!
The old man's head directly flew out!
Instant Kill!
Seeing Ye Xuan make a move, the expressions of the remaining Consolidation Realm experts changed drastically. One of the middle-aged men suddenly said fiercely, "Since Ye Xuan won't let us live, then we'll die together!"
As soon as he finished speaking, he charged out, and the experts behind him charged out as well!
Ye Xuan's face was expressionless. "Kill!
Leave no one alive! "
Leave no one alive!
As soon as Ye Xuan's voice fell, the experts behind him directly rushed out, as well as the twenty super assassins from Xuan City!
In order to reduce the losses, Ye Xuan also attacked!
Very quickly, bloody heads rained down from the sky …
Massacre!
Without the experts of the Dao Sect, although these Consolidation Realm experts were strong, they were far inferior to the Fifth Dimension in both quantity and quality.
This was especially true for Ye Xuan. Almost none of the Consolidation Realm experts present could withstand his Instant Kill Sword!
Once the sword was drawn, there would be death!
In a short while, all the hundred or so people present were killed, and their souls were absorbed by Ye Xuan's Soul Suppressing Sword …
After absorbing those souls, the Soul Suppressing Sword directly returned to the Prison Pagoda!
It was going to break through!
Just when everyone thought that the matter was about to end, in the starry sky of the Fifth Dimension, a powerful pressure like a mountain crushed over!
Boom!
The entire starry sky of the Fifth Dimension directly trembled …
Below, Ye Xuan suddenly raised his head, and there was a trace of shock in his eyes.
What a powerful aura!
Who is this?
.....
PS: This month is about to end.
If you don't vote now, you won't have the chance to vote again!
Hehe!







Chapter 1470
Who is it?
At this moment, all the experts in the surroundings were looking up at the starry sky. That aura was so formidable that it shocked them.
Under everyone's gazes, the space in the sky suddenly split open. In the next moment, a middle aged man walked out from within the space that had split open.
The middle aged man wore a grey robe with wide sleeves, and his hands were hidden within them. He seemed like a scholar, quiet, and refined.
Ye Xuan frowned slightly because he didn't recognize the middle aged man!
Suddenly, a voice resounded in Ye Xuan's mind. "Wu Li, the Martial Emperor!"
It was Lan Ruo's voice!
The Martial Emperor!
Ye Xuan's eyes narrowed slightly when he heard this. He knew who it was!
It was that big shot who imprisoned Jia Long and the others!
Ye Xuan was quite puzzled. Why has he made an appearance at this moment?
Wu Li looked down at Ye Xuan and said, "Where's that woman?"
Jia Lou!
Ye Xuan was about to speak when Jia Lou appeared by Ye Xuan's side. At this moment, Jia Lou had attained the peak of the Dao Attainment Realm under the full support of the Fifth Dimension. It could be said that she was only a little bit away from attaining the Union Realm!
Jia Lou stared Wu Li in the eyes without a trace of fear. Conversely, her eyes were filled with killing intent. It could be said that it was like the eyes of an enemy that had met.
Meanwhile, Wu Li suddenly slapped his palm down.
The space in the sky above Jia Lou collapsed!
At practically the exact same moment, Jia Lou smashed her fist forward!
She was going head-on against it!
She had no choice but to go head-on against it because Wu Li's punch had sealed off the space around her!
Rumble!
Along with a deafening explosion, the space where Jia Lou stood collapsed, and she was instantly pushed back thousands of meters. As soon as she stopped moving, the dragon scales on her body cracked inch by inch. Not only that, but even her Dao Body shattered at this moment.
Everyone in the surroundings was shocked when they witnessed this scene!
Right at this moment, Wu Li smashed his fist forward again!
Hiss!
The space in front of Jia Lou collapsed, and a fist mark flashed out, heading straight for Jia Lou. The powerful fist force was like a tsunami, directly crushing the space in front of Jia Lou and deforming it.
Jialou's pupils constricted. She couldn't block this punch!
Jialou did not close her eyes. Even at this moment, there was no fear in her eyes!
Right at this moment, a ray of sword light suddenly slashed down.
Boom!
The fist mark was forced to a stop by the sword light, but the next moment, the sword light shattered, and the fist mark broke through the air.
Meanwhile, Ye Xuan appeared in front of Jia Lou, and a trace of ferocity flashed through his eyes as he slashed with his sword!
He directly used the power of his bloodline and the power of the Unparalleled Sword.
Boom!
As soon as the sword descended, the fist collapsed, and Ye Xuan and Jia Lou were instantly blasted back over 3km!
After stopping, Ye Xuan's entire right hand trembled slightly.
In the sky, Wu Li looked at Ye Xuan. "Do you think that I don't dare to kill you?"
Ye Xuan looked Wu Li in the eyes, "I promised a senior from the Jia Dragon Clan that I would take care of Miss Jia Lou. I, Ye Xuan, keep my word!"
Wu Li nodded, "I know that you have many powerful backers, but …."
Ye Xuan suddenly said, "I'll fight you one on one!"
One on one!
Wu Li's eyes narrowed slightly, "Fight me one on one?"
Ye Xuan looked Wu Li in the eyes, "I don't know what enmity you have with the Jia Dragons, and I don't want to know!
I'll fight you one on one, and I, Ye Xuan, will take over the enmity between you and the Jia Dragons. "
A trace of gratification flashed through the eyes of the mysterious woman in the clouds, and she smiled, "At least he's responsible. He didn't bring shame to his parents!"
Nian Nian gazed into the distance in silence.
In the distance, behind Ye Xuan, Jia Lou tugged on Ye Xuan's sleeve and shook her head.
Ye Xuan smiled, "I promised your grandfather that I would protect you!
I keep my word! "
Then
Jia Lou looked at Ye Xuan, "This enmity is between me, Jia Lou, and him!"
Ye Xuan said, "The Jia Dragons have been kind to me."
Jia Lou said in a low voice, "He's very strong!"
Ye Xuan smiled, "One can't be ungrateful!"
As he spoke, he raised his head to look at Wu Li, "What do you think?"
Wu Li looked at Ye Xuan, "It's not fair for you to fight me one on one!"
Ye Xuan said, "Then lower your realm and fight me!"
The crowd, "…."
In the clouds, the mysterious woman suddenly laughed, "This little fellow is really interesting!
This Wu Li is really unlucky to have encountered such a thick-skinned fellow! "
In the distance, Wu Li looked at Ye Xuan, "What if I don't lower my realm?"
Ye Xuan smiled, "Then I'll challenge someone of a higher realm. It's not shameful if I lose, and it's a huge profit if I win!"
Everyone had a strange expression on their faces. Needless to say, this was indeed the case.
Wu Li slowly walked towards Ye Xuan. With every step he took, his aura became weaker. When he was several dozen feet away from Ye Xuan, his realm had already been suppressed to the Consolidation Realm!
Wu Li looked at Ye Xuan, "Suppressing to the Consolidation Realm is my limit!"
Ye Xuan smiled, "That's enough!"
As his voice fell, he suddenly raised his sword and rushed forward. In front of Wu Li, the space was suddenly torn apart, and a ray of sword light appeared!
Wu Li slightly leaned to the side, and a sword passed right between his eyebrows. At this time, his right hand suddenly swept out.
Bang!
A ray of sword light shattered, and Ye Xuan instantly retreated thousands of feet!
The moment he stopped, the flesh in front of his chest split open, and blood flowed out!
Seeing this scene, the expressions of many experts in the Fifth Dimension sank.
Ye Xuan looked at his chest, and his expression gradually became solemn!
This Martial Emperor's moves were very simple, speed and power!
In terms of speed and power, he was suppressed!
At this time, Wu Li took a step forward, and with this step, a fist imprint suddenly appeared in front of Ye Xuan!
Ye Xuan was already prepared, and he raised his sword and slashed.
Bang!
The space where Ye Xuan was directly collapsed, and his entire body was sent several thousand feet back!
Before he could stop, Wu Li took another step forward, and with each step, he threw a punch!
It was a very simple punch!
At this time, in the distance, Ye Xuan suddenly stomped his right foot. In the next instant, he gripped his sword with both hands and fiercely slashed forward. The moment his sword fell, four kinds of domains directly enveloped Wu Li.
Bang!
Within the domains, the fist imprint directly shattered, and Wu Li retreated several dozen feet.
Seeing this scene, the experts of the Fifth Dimension immediately breathed a sigh of relief. It was good that there was still a fight!
In the distance, Wu Li looked at Ye Xuan. "Four kinds of domains!"
Ye Xuan nodded.
Wu Li said in a light voice, "I'm slightly surprised!"
As he spoke, he took another step forward.
Bang!
The space in front of Ye Xuan suddenly collapsed, and in the next moment, an afterimage flashed by. The strength of this afterimage was so strong that even four kinds of domains found it difficult to suppress it!
Right at this moment, Ye Xuan slowly closed his eyes, and in the next moment, he suddenly slashed down with his sword.
As this sword descended, Wu Li's pupils suddenly constricted, and he changed from offense to defense. He raised his right arm horizontally to block.
Bang!
Under the gazes of everyone, Wu Li retreated explosively by several hundred feet!
Everyone in the surroundings was stunned when they witnessed this scene!
What kind of power is this?
In the distance, Bai Dizi was slightly excited. He knew what kind of power this was!
The Power of Faith!
This was the Power of Faith of all the living beings in the Fifth Dimension!
And now, Ye Xuan was using this Power of Faith!
The purest Power of Faith!
At this moment, Ye Xuan wasn't alone!
He represented everyone who believed in him!
"The Power of Faith!"
Above the clouds, the mysterious woman.
She said in a light voice, "Very pure Power of Faith."
Behind her, the Divine Lord's expression was extremely gloomy.
Nian Nian looked into the distance and still didn't speak, but there was a trace of gratification in her eyes!
She knew that the reason Ye Xuan was able to possess such pure Power of Faith was because the living beings in the Fifth Dimension trusted him. In other words, Ye Xuan was sufficiently good to all the living beings in the Fifth Dimension!
In the distance, Wu Li looked at Ye Xuan. "The Power of Faith!"
Ye Xuan grinned. "Take another strike from me!"
As soon as he finished speaking, he took a step forward, twisted his wrist, and slashed down with his sword.
Hiss!
A ray of sword light tore through the sky!
In the distance, Wu Li suddenly clenched his right hand, and then he smashed his fist forward!
Bang!
The space where his fist descended directly transformed into a vortex, and a powerful force poured out like a torrent.
At this moment, the heavens and earth shook and split!
Rumble!
As soon as the two powerful forces came into contact, it was like a volcanic eruption. The powerful force swept across the entire world, and the expressions of the surrounding Consolidation Realm experts changed drastically, and they all retreated!
Below, a huge light screen suddenly rose from the Dao City.
A protective shield!
This was a protective shield built by the Xuanji Sect with all their might. It was to prevent the powerful forces from entering the Fifth Dimension and causing a devastating blow to the Fifth Dimension!
The remaining power was completely blocked by the protective barrier. However, the entire protective barrier was also shattered.
In the sky, Wu Li retreated more than three hundred feet, but Ye Xuan didn't even take a step back!
At this time, Ye Xuan not only had the blessing of four kinds of domains, but also the Power of Faith of the Fifth Dimension. His current strength had exceeded the scope of the Consolidation Realm!
Wu Li looked at Ye Xuan. He knew that if he didn't restore his realm, with his current strength, he wouldn't be able to do anything to Ye Xuan.
He had underestimated this young man in front of him!
Ye Xuan suddenly said, "Your Excellency Martial Emperor, today, I, Ye Xuan, took advantage of you, and this is quite unfair to you. How about this, in a year, let's fight again. At that time, you don't have to suppress your realm!"
Fight more!
Wu Li looked at Ye Xuan, "You want to delay for a year!"
Ye Xuan nodded, "Yes!"
Wu Li's expression was calm, "Do you really have to interfere in the affairs of the Naga Dragon Clan?"
Ye Xuan said, "I have to repay the kindness of others!"
Wu Li stared at Ye Xuan and didn't speak.
Ye Xuan said again, "Just one year!
A year later, I, Ye Xuan, will fight you fairly. I can swear to the heavens that if there are people behind me, I won't let them interfere!
Do you think it's feasible? "
Wu Li slowly loosened his right hand, "A year later, life and death!"
A life and death!
Ye Xuan said, "Sure!"
Wu Li glanced at Jia Lou, "Your grandfather found a good person for you!"
With that, he turned and left.
After walking a few steps, he suddenly turned his head and looked at a certain place in the clouds, "Your Excellency, as you wish!"
With that, he quickly disappeared not far away.
Above the clouds, Nian Nian suddenly said, "Congratulations!"
The mysterious woman blinked, "What are you congratulating me for?"
Nian Nian looked at the mysterious woman, "If Wu Li wants to kill Jia Lou, he will need your help, because he will soon discover that his opponent will grow very quickly, so quickly that it will exceed his expectations.
At that time, even if he is unwilling, he can only ask for help from you!
And if he asks for help from you, then isn't the entire Ultimate Martial Realm in your pocket?
And with your intelligence, you should not be plotting just this. If I'm not wrong, the Ultimate Martial Realm is not simple!
What do you think? "
The mysterious woman looked at Nian Nian, and after a moment, she suddenly smiled and said, "If it wasn't for that kid below, I would be very willing to be friends with you, because you are too smart!
Unfortunately, we can only be enemies. "
Nian Nian took out a stick of tanghulu, "You made a move, now, it's my turn!"
The mysterious woman slightly raised the corner of her mouth, "Looking forward to it!"
.....







Chapter 1471
With Wu Li's departure, the entire Fifth Dimension completely calmed down!
There were no cheers.
Because the Fifth Dimension had also suffered heavy casualties!
In the sky, Ye Xuan looked up at the clouds in the sky. The next moment, he appeared directly above the clouds.
However, there was nothing here!
After a moment of silence, Ye Xuan turned around and left.
After returning to Dao City's Dao Hall, Nian Nian was sitting on the stone steps in front of the hall. She was holding a tanghulu in her hand.
Ye Xuan walked in front of Nian Nian. Nian Nian looked up at Ye Xuan. "Is it over?"
Ye Xuan smiled. "It's over for now!"
Nian Nian grinned. She took out a lively fish. "Grilled fish!"
Ye Xuan laughed. "Alright!"
As he spoke, he pulled Nian Nian into the hall.
Grilled fish!
The two sat next to each other. Nian Nian hugged Ye Xuan's arm and leaned her head against Ye Xuan's shoulder. There was a sweet smile on her face.
At this moment, Bai Dizi walked into the hall.
Looking at the White Emperor, Ye Xuan said with a smile, "Have a seat!"
Bai Dizi shook her head. "I'll just stand!"
Ye Xuan did not insist. "Let's talk!"
Bai Dizi hesitated for a moment. "Do you still have money?"
Hearing this, Ye Xuan was dumbfounded. He said in shock, "You ran out of money?"
Bai Dizi nodded. "I've basically spent all the money you gave me!"
Ye Xuan blinked. "All spent?
Three billion! "
Bai Dizi nodded slightly.
Ye Xuan was a little curious. "How did you spend it?"
He knew that Bai Dizi was usually not extravagant.
Bai Dizi said in a deep voice, "Those pills were basically given to the most outstanding people. As for these Fortune Divine Crystals, they have many uses!
Among them, I used one billion Fortune Divine Crystals to support the world below! "
Ye Xuan looked at Bai Dizi. "The world below?"
Bai Dizi said in a deep voice, "It's just some low-level worlds!
These worlds are very, very backward. Then, I used your name to establish a few martial arts academies in these backward worlds. The name of the academy is called Fifth Dimensional Academy, and you are the dean.
Those who meet certain requirements can enter the Martial Arts Academy for free … Based on preliminary estimates, we have already established more than a million Fifth Dimensional Academies. Moreover, we are still expanding … This expenditure is extremely large, but it is extremely meaningful! "
Ye Xuan said, "Tell me!"
Bai Dizi nodded. "There are two main reasons why the Five-Dimensional Universe is lagging behind other worlds. The first is the upper limit. What is the upper limit?
This is the martial arts civilization of our Five-Dimensional Universe!
Before there was the Dao Scripture, other than the Five-Dimensional Tendo, the ceiling of the Five-Dimensional Universe's Martial Dao was Release One, and it was a fake Release One.
But now, it is different. We have the Dao Scripture, and with the addition of the Whirling World, our current upper limit is no different from the Dao Sect!
But what about the lower limit?
Some of the worlds below the Five-Dimensional Universe are too backward!
Some of them are even in the Savage Era … My idea is very simple. We will establish Fifth Dimensional Academies in various places to give those backward worlds a chance to learn martial arts, and also give them a chance to change their destiny!
When there are more and more outstanding people, it will be much easier for us to change the entire Five-Dimensional Universe! "
After saying this, he paused, then continued, "Of course, there is also some selfishness!
I established the Fifth Dimensional Academy in your name. It can be said that as long as someone comes out of our academy, they will be your student. And these people will worship you like a god. The more students there are, the more power of belief you will have!
This is a win-win situation!
The most important thing is that we can also unearth more talents. Some people, it is not that they do not have the ability, it is not that they do not work hard, it is just that they do not have the opportunity, they do not have the platform. If we give them the opportunity and platform, they will not be worse than anyone else. "
Ye Xuan
Pondering.
Bai Dizi hesitated for a while, then said, "This matter is my own initiative, I …"
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "You think too much!
You have done very well!
I have to say, in terms of the overall situation, we are inferior to you!
As for the matter of money, I will think of a way! "
Bai Dizi nodded, "If you say so, then I can rest assured!
There is one more thing, and that is, I have collected the martial arts books of the Daoting and Saha World. These martial arts books and divine techniques, I have already ordered people to compile them. When the time comes, they will be stored in the various academies. As long as you meet the requirements, you will be able to cultivate.
However, for the time being, Dao scriptures, martial arts, and Dao scripture cultivation methods will be placed in our Dao City's Fifth Dimensional Academy. The Dao City's Fifth Dimensional Academy is the main academy. This place will be the holy land in the hearts of all the students of the Fifth Dimensional Academy. Everyone will strive to cultivate in order to come here!
Because only by coming here can you learn the legendary Dao scripture martial arts and Dao scripture mental cultivation methods!
The most important thing is, only by coming here can you see the mysterious Dean! "
Ye Xuan: "…"
Bai Dizi smiled faintly, "If you want to come here, it will be very, very difficult!
It can be said that among millions of people, only one person can come here, because we only recruit 30 people every year!
At that time, when the headquarters starts to recruit, you must personally come to take a look, you will definitely be shocked!
Because those who can come to the headquarters must be super evildoers!
Those kind of true super evildoers! "
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "I am looking forward to it!"
As he said this, he hesitated for a while, then said, "Everything you have done is very good, but, in terms of culture …"
Bai Dizi smiled and said, "Don't worry, all the academies cultivate both literature and martial arts!
Cultivating literature, which is also cultivating the mind, is equally important as cultivating martial arts! "
Ye Xuan nodded, "You have thought it through very thoroughly!"
As he said this, he looked at Nian Nian, who was beside him, "Nian Nian's contribution to the Five-Dimensional Universe being able to have what it is today is indispensable. Her contribution to the Five-Dimensional Universe should be known by everyone in the Five-Dimensional Universe."
Bai Dizi glanced at Nian Nian and nodded, "I know, in cultural classes, there is an article about a person's biography. Only people who have made great contributions to the Five-Dimensional Universe can be included in this article. Currently, there are only two people, one is Miss Nian Nian, and the other is you. Miss Nian Nian is ranked first, and you are ranked second!
In addition, we have also built Miss Nian Nian's memorial courtyards all over the world, which have detailed records of Miss Nian Nian's contributions to the Five-Dimensional Universe. "
Ye Xuan looked at Bai Dizi and said with a smile, "You are really thoughtful!"
Bai Dizi said softly, "Whether it is Miss Nian Nian or you, even if what you have done for the Five-Dimensional Universe is not praised by the world, it should not be forgotten by the world!"
In fact, the Five-Dimensional Universe was a burden to both Ye Xuan and Nian Nian!
As long as Mu Niannian gave up on the Five-Dimensional Universe, other than the three swords, she was almost invincible. To Nian Nian, without the Five-Dimensional Universe, she would be even stronger!
As if he had thought of something, Bai Dizi said, "One more thing, we have already formulated a law. As long as you nod your head, it can be implemented in the entire Five-Dimensional Universe."
As he said that, he took out a thick book and handed it to Ye Xuan.
Ye Xuan took it and glanced at it. A moment later, he looked at Bai Dizi, "Is this law only for the people at the bottom, or for everyone?"
Bai Dizi looked at Ye Xuan, "For everyone!
Including you!
Even you don't have the privilege! "
Ye Xuan nodded, "Then that's enough!"
After saying that, he handed the book to Bai Dizi.
Bai Dizi took the book and said, "Then I'll start implementing it!"
Ye Xuan nodded.
Bai Dizi retreated.
Ye Xuan handed the roasted fish to Nian Nian and said with a smile, "Eat!"
Nian Nian took the roasted fish and said with a smile, "I'm going out to play!"
After saying that, she picked up the roasted fish and left the hall.
Only Ye Xuan was left in the hall.
Ye Xuan sat cross-legged on the ground and spread his hands. Suddenly, a mysterious power appeared around him!
The power of faith!
He could feel that his power of faith was continuously becoming stronger.
This power of faith was very strong!
If not for this power of faith, he would not have been able to do anything to Wu Li.
However, he also understood that this power did not completely belong to him, Ye Xuan.
This was given to him by all living beings!
If one day, he went against the flow and the Five-Dimensional Universe collapsed, then this power of faith would disappear!
He could not rely too much on this power of faith!
As if thinking of something, Ye Xuan took out a scroll. This was the content and notes of the ninth volume of the Dao Scripture. It also contained the ninth volume of the Dao Scripture's mental cultivation method and Dao Scripture martial arts!
Life Fist!
The ninth volume of the Dao Scripture martial arts was Life Fist. When he saw the content of this Life Fist, Ye Xuan's expression suddenly changed!
What was Life Fist?
By burning one's lifespan as the price, one could obtain endless lifespan power!
Lifespan power!
This was the first time Ye Xuan heard of this power!
By burning one year of lifespan, one could obtain ten years of cultivation. By burning one hundred years, one could obtain a thousand years of cultivation. By burning one thousand years, one could obtain ten thousand years of cultivation … Not only that, when burning one's lifespan, one could also trigger one's own destiny power …
Ye Xuan closed the ancient book and could not calm down for a long time!
This thing could not be easily cultivated!
This Life Fist was extremely profound and mysterious. It also involved the power of destiny and some karma power. In any case, he did not understand it.
Most importantly, this thing needed to burn one's lifespan!
And he, Ye Xuan, did not have much lifespan left!
His current lifespan was less than a thousand years!
If he burned his lifespan, he was afraid that he would directly die!
Moreover, this Life Fist was not something he could cultivate just because he wanted to. It was extremely difficult. Not to mention, one of the difficulties was the physical body. His physical body must be at the Consolidation Realm before he could reluctantly cultivate it!
Reluctantly!
If his physical body was not strong enough, he would not be able to withstand the power obtained by burning his lifespan!
In addition, his Divine Soul must be strong enough …
It could be said that this Life Fist had very strict requirements for the cultivator.
Ye Xuan hesitated.
There was no doubt about the power of this Life Fist. Once it was cultivated, its power would not be any weaker than his Instant Kill Sword, or even stronger. Most importantly, he could combine both of them!
After burning his lifespan to obtain the power of life, he could use the Instant Kill Sword again …
In that case, it could be said that his strength and speed would reach a very terrifying level!
However, burning one's lifespan was really not a joke. Moreover, it could be addictive.
Because the more lifespan burned, the stronger the power!
There was no upper limit!
The moment of death was also the moment when he was at his strongest …
After a long time, Ye Xuan finally chose to cultivate it. However, in order to cultivate this Life Fist, he had to first improve his physical body to the Consolidation Realm …
And now, if he wanted to advance to the Consolidation Realm, he needed the Ancestral Dragon's blood, and the Ancestral Dragon's blood could only be obtained by Taoism!
Would Taoism give it to him?
Of course not!
As if thinking of something, Ye Xuan said softly, "This time, Taoism besieged my Five-Dimensional Universe … No matter what, they should compensate me for my mental damage …"
After saying that, he suddenly got up and left.
...

Chapter 1472
Dao Sect!
Somewhere in the hall, Third Lady was sitting cross-legged on the ground. In front of her was a long ruler.
Dao Gate Ruler!
Inside the hall, there were some Dao Sect experts!
At this moment, everyone's expression was somewhat ugly.
In this trip to the Fifth Dimension, Dao Sect could be said to have suffered a great defeat. This time, Dao Sect's losses were too heavy.
At this moment, Third Lady suddenly opened her eyes. The next moment, she disappeared.
In the sky outside the hall, Third Lady appeared in front of a man.
This man was Ye Xuan!
Seeing Third Lady, Ye Xuan was secretly on guard. This woman was not simple, he must be careful.
Third Lady looked at Ye Xuan, "What's the matter?"
Ye Xuan nodded.
Third Lady asked, "What's the matter?"
Ye Xuan thought for a moment, then said, "Your Dao Sect besieged me, causing indelible damage to my young mind. Shouldn't you compensate me for my mental damage?"
Third Lady looked at Ye Xuan, "Are you serious?"
Ye Xuan nodded.
Third Lady said, "You want the Ancestral Dragon's blood!"
Ye Xuan blinked, he was a little surprised, "How do you know?"
Third Lady said again, "You want to cultivate Life Fist!"
Ye Xuan, "…"
Third Lady asked again, "Are you sure you want to cultivate Life Fist?"
Ye Xuan nodded.
Third Young Lady said, "I have to remind you that even in our Taoism, only two people have practiced this Taoist scripture martial art."
Ye Xuan frowned, "Two people?"
Third Lady nodded, "Master and me!"
Ye Xuan blinked, "Third Lady has cultivated Life Fist?"
Third Lady looked at Ye Xuan, "Is there a problem?"
Ye Xuan hesitated, then said, "Is it powerful?"
Third Lady looked at Ye Xuan, "Do you want to try?"
Ye Xuan quickly shook his head. "No need!"
What a joke! He couldn't even defeat this woman without using her Life Punch. If she used her Life Punch, his Taoist body would probably be blasted into smithereens.
Third Young Lady said, "It's impossible for you to learn this Life Fist by yourself. In other words, you have to take a lot of detours!
Do you want me to teach you? "
Ye Xuan was stunned, and then he said, "You'll teach me?"
The Third Young Lady nodded. "If you want, I can teach you!"
Ye Xuan was puzzled. "Why?"
The Third Young Lady turned her head and looked into the distance. "Do you want to go for a walk?"
Ye Xuan thought about it and nodded. "Sure!"
Third Young Lady nodded and walked to the right. Ye Xuan followed her.
Not long after, the two of them arrived at the back of a mountain. There was a Xiao Dao at the back of the mountain, and at the end of the Xiao Dao was a cliff.
The two of them walked along the Xiao Dao.
Third Young Lady suddenly said, "Young Master Ye, the reason why my Second Senior Brother targeted you like a madman is because you have the Dao Scriptures. He's afraid that you'll collect all nine Dao Scriptures and threaten his position.
Of course, there's another reason. All these years, the Taoists have been used to being high and mighty!
He thinks that the Taoists are number one in the world, and no one can offend them.
Moreover, he's being used by someone! "
Ye Xuan frowned slightly. "Used by someone?"
Third Young Lady turned her head and looked at Young Master Ye. "Young Master Ye, you have a very powerful enemy. How powerful is he?
I think that if the other party wants to kill you, you won't be able to survive. However, I don't understand why the other party didn't kill you. Perhaps it's because he's afraid of the person behind you. "
Ye Xuan said in a deep voice, "Who is that person?"
Third Young Lady shook her head. "I don't know him, and I don't want to know him.
This is a matter between Young Master Ye and the other party. My Taoists doesn't want to interfere. "
Ye Xuan didn't say anything. He had some doubts in his heart. Who is this enemy?
Third Young Lady said again, "Young Master Ye, if you want to learn Life Fist, I can help you. I can even help you improve your physical body to the Consolidation Realm."
Ye Xuan looked at Third Young Lady. "What's the condition?"
Third Young Lady smiled slightly. "The grudge between the Fifth Dimension and the Taoists will be written off."
Ye Xuan was silent.
Third Young Lady continued, "Young Master Ye, your enemy isn't my Taoists, and my Taoists' enemy isn't you.
However, someone wants my Taoists to fight to the death with you, and then let you and my Taoists … Or rather, let you and Master form a bad relationship.
However, I feel that there's no need for us to become enemies. First, we don't have any conflict of interest. Second, we don't have any deep hatred. The reason for this situation, other than being used by others, is because my Second Senior Brother's IQ is limited.
And now, I'm in charge of the Taoists! "
Ye Xuan asked, "What about Second Brother?"
Third Young Lady said, "He has been imprisoned by me. He won't appear for at least a hundred years. And after a hundred years … If Young Master Ye hasn't fallen, I think Second Senior Brother shouldn't pose any threat to Young Master Ye. What do you think?"
Ye Xuan asked with a smile, "Can't you tell me who that mysterious person is?"
Third Young Lady said with a smile, "My Taoists can't afford to offend him!
Please forgive me, Young Master Ye! "
Ye Xuan was about to speak, but he found that he had already walked to the edge of the cliff. Under the cliff, clouds and mist lingered, making it unfathomable.
Third Young Lady gently pointed with her finger. The clouds and mist below suddenly separated. The next moment, Ye Xuan saw a behemoth!
Dragon!
To be precise, it was a dragon's head!
This dragon's head was at the bottom of the abyss. Its body followed the abyss for an unknown length.
The moment this dragon's head appeared, Ye Xuan suddenly felt an oppressive pressure!
Dragon's Might!
He had never felt such a strong Dragon's Might. Compared to this pressure, the Winged Dragon in Xuan City was simply child's play!
Ye Xuan said in a deep voice, "Ancestral Dragon!"
Third Young Lady nodded, "Only the Ancestral Dragon's blood can improve your current Dao Body!"
Ye Xuan looked at Third Young Lady, "This dragon has fallen?"
Third Young Lady nodded.
Ye Xuan was a little curious, "How did it fall?"
Third Young Lady said with a smile, "I don't know either!"
Ye Xuan was speechless.
Third Young Lady looked at the Ancestral Dragon below, "At that time, I was still young. I only know that after Master brought it back, it fell not long after.
As for the reason, Master never said!
After this dragon fell, Master guarded it for three months. Three months later, he left, and after that, there was no news of him. "
Saying that, she shook her head, "Young Master Ye, my Dao Faction has no intention of becoming enemies with you. My Dao Faction can't afford to offend you. Now that I am in charge of the Dao Faction, I want to settle the grudge between us with Young Master Ye!"
Ye Xuan said softly, "Third Young Lady, aren't you afraid that I will summon the Great Dao Spirit and threaten your position?"
Third Young Lady chuckled, "If that's the case, I can't wait to be happy!"
Ye Xuan was a little curious, "Why?"
Third Young Lady looked at Ye Xuan, "If you really get the recognition of the Great Dao Spirit, it means that you are the person appointed by Master, and you will also be a part of my Dao Faction. With a genius like you joining, I naturally should be happy.
As for the Dao Faction's Master … To put it bluntly, what's the use of that position?
Second Senior Brother spent a lot of effort to fight for the position. As long as I want to, I can take it back at any time! "
Saying that, she shook her head, "Second Senior Brother doesn't understand the principle that strength is the king. Whatever position, it's all empty."
Ye Xuan looked at Third Young Lady, "If I really get the recognition of the Great Dao Spirit, are you really willing to let me be the Dao Faction's Master?"
Third Young Lady nodded, "Yes."
Ye Xuan said, "Without the recognition of the Great Dao Spirit?"
Third Young Lady smiled, "No!"
Ye Xuan was a little puzzled, "Why?"
Third Young Lady smiled slightly, "If you have the recognition of the Great Dao Spirit, it means that you have obtained Master's recognition. Since you have obtained Master's recognition, Dao Faction should naturally share honor and disgrace with you, live and die together!
However, if you don't get the recognition of the Great Dao Spirit, it means that you have not obtained Master's recognition … In this case, I naturally can't use the entire Dao Faction's future to help you.
Moreover, you can't take the initiative to join Dao Faction, right? "
Ye Xuan said with a smile, "I see!
The Dao Faction's ancestor's opinion is the most important! "
Third Young Lady nodded, "Just like Second Senior Brother, although I also want to kill him, he is Master's disciple after all. Even if I don't give face to a monk, I still have to give face to Buddha, so I can't be too ruthless.
However, Young Master Ye can rest assured that from now on, he will not appear in front of Young Master Ye again.
This, I can guarantee. "
Ye Xuan looked at the Ancestor Dragon below and was silent.
In fact, he was very clear that the reason why Third Young Lady was so humble was not because of Ye Xuan, but because she was afraid of the person behind him. Moreover, she did not want to be used by others!
Third Young Lady looked down and was also silent.
She wanted to resolve the grievances between the Five-Dimensional Universe and Dao Faction because Dao Faction really had no reason to fight with Ye Xuan. Moreover, Ye Xuan being able to gather all nine Dao Scriptures was very abnormal. In her opinion, it was very likely that Ye Xuan was the person chosen by her Master!
However, she was not sure because the Great Dao Spirit had run away!
At this moment, Ye Xuan suddenly smiled and said, "Third Young Lady, let's talk about Life Fist!"
Third Young Lady glanced at Ye Xuan and said with a smile, "Let's talk about Dao Body first!
Young Master Ye's Dao Body cultivation is indeed very good, but his realm is a bit low. For Young Master Ye, the Dao Body of Achieved Dao Realm should be somewhat insufficient! "
As she said this, she looked down and said, "Young Master Ye's bloodline is overbearing. It is enough to absorb the Ancestor Dragon's blood, so it should not be a big problem for him to improve!
Also, this Ancestor Dragon's Scale Armor is extremely hard. I can give Young Master Ye a few pieces and let Young Master Ye forge them into treasured armor. This way, except for some mysterious experts, it should be impossible for ordinary people to kill Young Master Ye! "
Ye Xuan looked at Third Young Lady, "Mysterious experts?"
Third Young Lady nodded, "For example … the white-robed woman behind Young Master Ye!"
Ye Xuan said with a smile, "Why don't you use a different analogy?"
Third Young Lady smiled slightly, "It can't be helped. I'm weak and can't afford to offend others. Please forgive me, Young Master Ye!"
Ye Xuan smiled, then looked down and narrowed his eyes. Who was it that made Third Young Lady so afraid?
Who was it that wanted to mess with him?
At this moment, Third Young Lady suddenly said, "Young Master Ye, let's go down!"
Ye Xuan collected his thoughts and nodded, "Okay!"
Soon, the two of them walked towards the bottom of the abyss.
...
Somewhere in the starry sky, a little girl walked slowly. The little girl held a skewer of tanghulu in her left hand and a grilled fish in her right.
This little girl was Nian Nian!
After walking for an unknown period of time, the starry sky in front of Nian Nian suddenly shook violently and a voice came from it, "The three-dimensional universe does not welcome outsiders. Leave immediately!"
Nian Nian looked at the space in front of her, "Ye Xuan!"
After a moment of silence, that expanse of space suddenly split open, and then a woman walked out from within.
The woman was dressed in a white dress and held a halberd in her hand. Her expression was indifferent.
.....







Chapter 1473
Seeing this woman, Nian Nian's eyes flashed with surprise.
This woman is so strong!
This was her first impression!
The woman looked at Nian Nian, "Ye Xuan?"
Nian Nian nodded.
The woman asked, "Who are you!"
Nian Nian smiled, "Let me tell you slowly!"
...
On the other side, Ultimate Martial Realm.
On a certain mountain peak, Wu Li suddenly opened his eyes. Not far in front of him, stood a woman.
It was the mysterious woman from the Sacred Land!
Wu Li looked at the mysterious woman, "You want me to kill Ye Xuan!"
The mysterious woman shook her head and smiled, "No!
You can't kill him! "
Wu Li frowned, "The person behind him?"
The mysterious woman nodded and smiled, "Do you see the woman who stood with me that day?"
Wu Li was silent.
The mysterious woman said, "That's the Fifth Dimension Tendo!"
Wu Li said, "I know!"
The mysterious woman smiled, "The reason why you agreed to Ye Xuan's one year appointment is mainly because of her. Because you know, with her around, you can't kill Ye Xuan, right?"
Wu Li looked at the mysterious woman, "What are you trying to do!"
The mysterious woman smiled, "How confident do you think you are after one year?"
Wu Li was silent.
How confident?
In fact, he really wasn't confident!
His current realm was crushing Ye Xuan, but Ye Xuan's combat power wasn't weak at all. Moreover, Ye Xuan's growth speed was too fast!
One year later, was he really confident?
At this moment, the mysterious woman suddenly smiled, "Do you want to know what realm is above the God Realm?"
Wu Li's pupils suddenly shrank, he looked at the mysterious woman, "Who are you!"
The mysterious woman smiled, "I can't answer this question!"
Wu Li said in a deep voice, "Sir, with your strength, if you want to kill Ye Xuan, it should be a piece of cake!
Why do you want me to do it? "
The mysterious woman shook her head, "Not yet!"
Wu Li frowned. "Why?"
The mysterious woman smiled and said, "Because that woman is still quite close to here. I need her to speed up, or rather, I need his Disaster Cause to speed up … Because there are too many people helping him now, his Disaster Cause's progress is a bit slow."
Wu Li stared at the mysterious woman. "You don't dare to kill him openly!"
The mysterious woman smiled and said, "That's not something you should worry about!
This time, I came to ask you a question. Are you willing to let go of Jia Lou of the Jia Long tribe?
If you are willing to let go of this hatred, I will never come looking for you again!
If you're not willing, we can work together. "
Wu Li was silent.
The mysterious woman smiled, "It seems that you are unwilling to let go of your hatred!"
As she spoke, she tapped with her finger, and an ancient scroll appeared before Wu Li. "This scroll can allow you to advance a step further!"
With that, she turned around and left.
Wu Li remained silent on the spot. A moment later, he opened the ancient book, and his expression gradually turned solemn. In the end, the solemn look in his eyes gradually turned into excitement …
...
In the horizon, the mysterious woman walked towards the distance, and behind her was the Sacred Master.
The Sacred Master hesitated for a moment, and then said, "Master, you want to nurture this Wu Li and let him fight against Ye Xuan?"
The mysterious woman shook her head and smiled. "I'm not interested in him, but the Ultimate Martial Realm!"
Ultimate Martial Realm!
The Sacred Master was silent!
To the entire Ultimate Martial Realm, even the Sacred Master didn't know much!
Even the Sacred Master didn't know much about it!
He only knew that the Ultimate Martial Realm had produced six Martial Emperors!
After the Dao Sect's ancestor disappeared, the Ultimate Martial Realm instantly became the number one power, but the Sacred Master didn't know anything about the situation inside the Ultimate Martial Realm!
The Ultimate Martial Realm wasn't open to the outside world, and outsiders couldn't enter at all. This place was actually very mysterious!
The mysterious woman turned around and glanced in the direction of the Ultimate Martial Realm, and said with a smile, "This place isn't simple!"
With that, she withdrew her gaze. "Let's go meet some old fellows!"
As she spoke, she walked towards the distance.
Before long, the two of them disappeared into the distant horizon.
...
Dao Sect.
Ye Xuan and the Third Young Lady arrived at the bottom of the abyss. Needless to say, Ye Xuan was shocked by the abyss!
To be more precise, he was shocked by the Ancestral Dragon!
The abyss was truly bottomless, and they still hadn't reached the bottom after descending for almost 150km. Ye Xuan still didn't know exactly how big the Ancestral Dragon was, because when he looked down from his position, the abyss was at least tens of thousands of km long.
Right at this moment, the Third Young Lady suddenly stopped, and then she looked at the Ancestral Dragon and bowed slightly. "Sorry for the offense!"
As she spoke, she pressed her fingers together and lightly swiped, and then a part of the Ancestral Dragon that didn't have scales split open and blood sprayed out.
The Third Young Lady gestured with her right hand, and all the blood fell into a white gourd in her hand.
The Ancestral Dragon's blood!
Ye Xuan was slightly excited as he looked at the white gourd.
He could sense how formidable the Ancestral Dragon's blood was, and it could be said that the Dark City's Winged Dragon couldn't compare to this enormous dragon at all.
Meanwhile, the Third Young Lady suddenly put away the gourd, and then she passed it to Ye Xuan. "Let's begin!"
Ye Xuan hesitated for a moment, and then he asked. "Is this enough?"
The Third Young Lady smiled. "If it's not enough, then we can take more!
In any case, it's convenient! "
Ye Xuan nodded, and then he took the gourd. He opened it, and a wave of heat assaulted his face!
The Ancestral Dragon's blood was red like lava!
Ye Xuan looked at the Third Young Lady. "Are we going to swallow it just like that?"
The Third Young Lady nodded. "Yes!"
Ye Xuan hesitated for a moment, and then he asked. "Will it be dangerous?"
The Third Young Lady sized up Ye Xuan and said, "Your body should be able to endure it!"
Ye Xuan thought for a moment, and then he nodded. "Alright!"
As he spoke, he directly drank the Ancestral Dragon's blood!
Bang!
As soon as the blood entered his body, Ye Xuan's clothes were instantly transformed into ash. At the same time, his entire body actually started burning!
The Third Young Lady sized up Ye Xuan's body, and then she said, "Use the energy of your bloodline to suppress it!"
Ye Xuan hurriedly activated the energy of his bloodline. As soon as he did, the energy of the Ancestral Dragon's blood was instantly suppressed!
Ye Xuan instantly heaved a sigh of relief when he witnessed this scene.
If the energy of his bloodline wasn't able to suppress the Ancestral Dragon's blood, then he might be finished!
Because he felt like his body was on the verge of being incinerated when the Ancestral Dragon's blood entered his body!
The Ancestral Dragon's blood was too domineering!
Even his Dao Physique was unable to endure it!
Fortunately, the energy of his bloodline was able to suppress the Ancestral Dragon's blood. Otherwise, his current Dao Physique would really not dare to absorb the Ancestral Dragon's blood!
Suddenly, the Third Young Lady said, "Start absorbing the Ancestral Dragon's blood!"
Ye Xuan nodded. He sat cross-legged on the ground and started to absorb the Ancestral Dragon's blood.
The Third Young Lady ceaselessly sized Ye Xuan up, and it didn't take long for her gaze to descend onto a certain spot on Ye Xuan's body.
She shook her head. "Isn't that part of yours too ugly!
What's the use of it? "
Ye Xuan was speechless.
It didn't take long for Ye Xuan to feel that the Ancestral Dragon's blood within his body had been completely absorbed. However, his body still hadn't changed at all!
Ye Xuan opened his eyes and gazed at the Third Young Lady. The latter fell silent for a moment before she went to get another gourd of Ancestral Dragon's blood and passed it to Ye Xuan.
Ye Xuan didn't hold back, and he picked up the gourd and gulped it down.
As soon as the gourd of Ancestral Dragon's blood entered his body, the formidable energy of Dragon Blood started to spread throughout Ye Xuan's body. Ye Xuan hurriedly utilized the energy of his bloodline to suppress it ….
About an hour later, Ye Xuan opened his eyes again and gazed at the Third Young Lady.
The Ancestral Dragon's blood had been completely absorbed by him again!
However, his body still hadn't changed much!
The Third Young Lady frowned. "How can you eat so much?"
Ye Xuan smiled bitterly. "I don't know either!"
As he spoke, he glanced at the huge Ancestral Dragon not far away. "Then, Third Young Lady, can you let me absorb more?
Look at this dragon, it's huge! "
The Third Young Lady glared at Ye Xuan. "This Dragon's blood is very precious!"
Ye Xuan smiled bitterly. "I know, but I don't think it's of much use for you to let me absorb so little!
Look at me, my body hasn't changed at all! "
The Third Young Lady thought for a moment and said, "Just you wait!"
As she spoke, she turned and left!
After the Third Young Lady left, Ye Xuan's gaze fell on the Ancestral Dragon, and his eyes lit up.
This Ancestral Dragon's entire body was a treasure!
Moreover, it was a priceless treasure!
At this moment, the Third Young Lady took out a large wooden bucket filled with Dragon's blood.
The Third Young Lady looked at Ye Xuan. "Drink it!"
Ye Xuan blinked his eyes. "So much!"
The Third Young Lady said plainly, "I want to see how much you can absorb!"
Ye Xuan smiled. He directly picked up the wooden bucket and drank it. As the Dragon's blood entered Ye Xuan's body, Ye Xuan's body gradually started to become red hot like iron …
There was finally a change!
The Third Young Lady heaved a sigh of relief. After all, the Ancestral Dragon's blood was very precious. One must know that there was only one Ancestral Dragon. Its blood would decrease every time it was used, and it couldn't be regenerated!
Under such circumstances, its blood was even more precious!
Not to mention Ye Xuan, even the internal members of Taoism would find it difficult to obtain the Ancestral Dragon's blood.
At this moment, a powerful aura suddenly emanated from Ye Xuan's body. At the same time, his body directly burned!
Ye Xuan was shocked. He hurriedly activated the power of the bloodline in his body to suppress it!
The Third Young Lady suddenly said, "Don't just suppress it. Remember to absorb it!
Also, circulate the Dao Scripture's mental cultivation method. Let that mental cultivation method assist your bloodline power. "
Ye Xuan nodded and hurriedly circulated the Dao Scripture's mental cultivation method … Just like that, the Ancestral Dragon's blood in his body gradually calmed down and was absorbed by his body bit by bit. His body was also slowly changing …
The Third Young Lady just looked at Ye Xuan. No one knew what she was thinking.
...
Three-dimensional universe.
The woman in the white dress and Nian Nian walked slowly. After a long time, Nian Nian turned to look at the woman in the white dress. "This is it!"
The woman in the white dress was silent for a moment. She slowly closed her eyes. "I know who that woman is!"
Nian Nian was a little curious. "Who?"
The woman in the white dress opened her eyes and whispered, "If it's really her, then he's in danger!"
.....

But I don't dare to ask for it because I'm afraid of being scolded!







Chapter 1474
Danger!
Upon hearing the white-dressed woman's words, Nian Nian pulled out the tanghulu in her mouth and said, "I've been targeted by the Cause of Misfortune and can't make a move. If I make a move, it will be exactly what that woman wants, so …"
At this point, she looked at the white-dressed woman. "I'm here to look for you!"
The white-dressed woman fell silent.
Nian Nian asked, "It's not convenient to make a move?"
The white-dressed woman nodded. "It's not convenient!
However, since it's her, I have to make a trip no matter what. "
Nian Nian nodded. "Thank you!"
After saying that, she glanced at the three-dimensional universe below. "No one is allowed to enter this place?"
The white-dressed woman nodded. "Especially someone as powerful as you."
Nian Nian asked with a smile, "Why?"
The white-dressed woman said, "To protect this universe!"
Protect!
Nian Nian nodded. "Understood!"
The white-dressed woman looked at Nian Nian. "Go back first. I will appear when it's time!"
Nian Nian smiled. "Alright!"
After saying that, she turned around and left.
On the spot, the woman was silent for a moment before shaking her head. "Doomed fate!"
After saying that, she turned around and left.
...
Nian Nian did not return to the Fifth Dimension directly. Instead, she went to the Nether Hall in the Fourth Dimension.
The hall was very quiet.
Just as Nian Nian walked into the hall, a voice sounded from within. "He caused trouble again?"
Nian Nian smiled. "Sort of!"
The voice said, "Can't solve it?"
Nian Nian shook her head. "I've already been targeted by the Cause of Misfortune. Once I make a move, the price will be too great."
The voice said softly, "Perhaps, he should be allowed to walk his own path!"
Nian Nian smiled. "I want to too!
However, a mysterious woman has appeared. That woman is not someone he can contend against now. "
The voice said, "What kind of woman?"
Nian Nian described.
A moment later, the voice said softly, "So it's her …"
Nian Nian smiled. "It seems that you all know her!"
The voice said, "I know her, and we used to be a little familiar!"
Nian Nian blinked. "Is it really as she said? She's very close to Ye Xuan?"
The voice said, "Very close, very close."
Nian Nian frowned. "Then why did she do that?"
The voice sighed. "It's complicated."
Nian Nian smiled. "So it's an old acquaintance of yours. What should we do?"
The voice was silent.
Nian Nian licked the candied fruit and said, "She wants to use the cause of disaster to kill him now, but I know that she definitely has a detailed plan. Once this plan succeeds, his life will really be in danger!"
The voice said, "In terms of strength, besides the three swords, no one can kill her!
In terms of intelligence, only Peony could compare to her … Should he look for Miss Ding?
She might have a better idea.
As for us, to tell you the truth, we've also encountered some problems, and it's difficult for us to leave. "
Nian Nian suddenly smiled and said, "There's no need!
Since you're in a difficult position, let me do it! "
With that, she turned around and left.
The voice said, "Young Miss, be careful of her. Since she's only acting against Ye Xuan now, then there's definitely a reason. Moreover, she definitely has a perfect plan once she makes a move!"
Nian Nian nodded. "I know!"
The voice continued, "Don't let Tian Ming interfere in this matter!"
Nian Nian was a little curious. "Why?"
After a moment of silence, the voice said, "Letting Heaven's Will interfere will make things more complicated.
It can cause internal strife here.
Because apart from her brother, Tian Ming doesn't recognize anyone and dares to kill anyone … If it weren't for the green-robed man, she would have even killed Ye Xuan's mother!
She would even kill us … She's unreasonable. Once she's angered, it'll be a disaster for the entire world!
And if she destroys the world again … then the cause of disaster on Ye Xuan will really be unsolvable! "
Nian Nian said softly, "Is the cause of his disaster because of the plain-dressed woman and his father?"
The voice said, "Half of the reason is because of them. The two of them are untainted by all kinds of karma, but it doesn't mean that their closest relatives can do the same.
It can be said that Ye Xuan is now taking the blame for them.
And it's precisely because of this that Tian Ming doesn't dare to kill anymore. Otherwise, before she leaves, she would probably kill everyone who can threaten her. "
As she said that, she paused and said, "Actually, her temper has changed a lot now. It's all because of him!"
Nian Nian was silent.
In fact, she had guessed a long time ago that part of the cause of Ye Xuan's disaster was because of the plain-dressed woman and the green-robed man. It was because these two closest relatives of Ye Xuan were not good people.
After a moment, Nian Nian suddenly said, "I understand!"
After saying that, she turned and left.
The voice said, "I will find a way to contact Miss Ding and see if she has a way to resolve this feud.
Also, Miss Nian, you must be careful when fighting with this woman. She may be more difficult to deal with than you think! "
Nian Nian smiled and said, "I understand!"
After saying that, she disappeared at the end of the horizon.
In the hall, a sigh sounded.
...
Dao Sect.
At the bottom of the abyss, Ye Xuan sat cross-legged on the ground. At that moment, a faint flame was emitting from his body.
That was the dragon flame emitted by the Ancestral Dragon's blood!
After drinking a full bottle of Ancestral Dragon's blood, his body finally changed. Most importantly, he had the third young lady's guidance!
He realized that the third young lady's understanding of the Dao Body far exceeded his.
At the side, the third young lady glanced at him and then turned and left.
Now, Ye Xuan had entered the final stage, and it would not be long before he could break through!
She still felt a little pained because Ye Xuan had absorbed too much Ancestral Dragon's blood!
Every bit he absorbed meant a little less!
The third young lady left the abyss and came to the Dao Prison!
The Dao Prison!
This was the place where the Dao Sect specially imprisoned disciples who had made mistakes!
The third young lady came in front of the Dao Sect's Second Brother, whose soul was currently locked by a flame.
Seeing the third young lady, the Dao Sect's Second Brother slowly closed his eyes. "Are you here to laugh at me?"
The third young lady shook her head. "Second Senior Brother, it seems that you haven't calmed down yet!"
After saying that, she turned and left.
At that moment, the Dao Sect's Second Brother suddenly said, "What are you afraid of?"
The third young lady turned to look at the Dao Sect's Second Brother and said with a smile, "Do you really think that the Immortal Realm is invincible?"
The Dao Sect's Second Brother looked at the third young lady. "I can kill Ye Xuan!"
The third young lady smiled slightly. "Under normal circumstances, I can kill him, but what about after I kill him?
Can the Dao Sect withstand the revenge of the forces behind him?
I know that we can. In our hearts, the Dao Sect has always been invincible. "
The Dao Sect's Second Brother was silent.
The third young lady continued, "Have you ever thought about why we want to kill him?
Just because he has the nine scrolls of the Dao Scripture?
But did he forget what his Master said?
The Dao Scripture is not the Dao Scripture of the Dao Sect, but the Dao Scripture of the world. Anyone can learn his martial arts. What is his greatest wish?
It is to exile the martial arts civilization in the Dao Scripture for all ages so that everyone can learn it.
But what about you?
As soon as he left, you took the Dao Scripture and everything about the Dao Sect for yourself!
Why doesn't the Spirit of the Great Path admit it?
You?
It's very simple. Because your actions have already violated Master's original intentions. "
The Dao Sect's Second Brother's face was gloomy and he did not speak.
The third young lady continued, "Even now, this Ye Xuan still thinks that the Dao Sect can kill him!
Do you know?
If the Dao Sect really touches him, the Dao Sect will be doomed eternally. "
The Dao Sect's Second Brother said in a deep voice, "What force is behind him?"
The third young lady shook her head, "I don't know!
I only know that it is definitely not a force that the Dao Sect can afford to offend. "
Then, she looked at the Dao Sect's Second Brother, "Second Senior Brother, do you know why you can't reach the Immortal State?"
The Dao Sect's Second Brother looked at the third young lady, and the third young lady said softly, "Because you care too much about the Dao Scripture.
Not only do you care about the Dao Scripture, but you also care about power!
You have taken the wrong path! "
After saying that, she turned around and left. When she reached the door, she stopped again, "Imprisoned for a hundred years. If you can wake up within a hundred years, you can reach the Immortal State. If you can't and still live in hatred, then die!"
As she spoke, she had already disappeared.
In the Dao Prison, the Dao Sect's Second Brother was silent.
...
After the third young lady left the Dao Prison, she looked up at the sky. At this moment, a shadow appeared behind her.
The shadow bowed slightly, "Third Young Lady!"
The third young lady said softly, "Have you found out where she came from?"
The shadow said in a deep voice, "I only know that she is from the Holy Ground, but I can't find out her identity!"
The Holy Ground!
The third young lady slowly closed her eyes, "That woman wants to use the Dao Sect as a tool!"
The shadow said in a deep voice, "Third Young Lady, do you want revenge?"
The third young lady shook her head, "We are no match for her!"
The shadow hesitated for a moment, then said, "Is she that strong?"
The third young lady said softly, "She is stronger than we thought!
However, we can't let this matter go just like that!
Doesn't she want to kill Ye Xuan?
Then let's help Ye Xuan and make Ye Xuan stronger!
Let's give her some trouble! "
After saying that, she turned around and left.
At the bottom of the abyss.
Ye Xuan suddenly opened his eyes. His eyes were filled with flames.
At this moment, the third young lady appeared in front of Ye Xuan. She looked at Ye Xuan, "Congratulations!"
Ye Xuan stood up, clenched his fists, and the surrounding space directly shattered!
Power!
At this moment, Ye Xuan felt endless power!
The power of the Ancestral Dragon's bloodline!
Now, not only had his physical body reached the Consolidation Realm, but his power had also increased by at least ten times!
Most importantly, his physical body had reached the Consolidation Realm!
Now, ordinary Consolidation Realm experts could not do anything to his physical body!
As if thinking of something, Ye Xuan looked at the third young lady, "Third young lady, can I practice Life Fist now?"
The third young lady nodded, "Yes!
However, the lethality of this move is too great. Using it once is equivalent to hurting the enemy by a thousand and hurting yourself by eight hundred, or even hurting the enemy by a thousand and hurting yourself by two thousand … So, are you sure you want to learn it? "
Ye Xuan smiled, "Learn it!"
The third young lady nodded, "Follow me!"
After saying that, she turned around and left.
Ye Xuan suddenly said, "Third young lady."
The third young lady turned to look at Ye Xuan. Ye Xuan hesitated, then said, "Didn't you say that you would give me the Ancestral Dragon's scale?"
After saying that, he walked to the Ancestral Dragon's side, patted one of the thick scales, and said with a smile, "I think this one is fine!
If you don't mind, I will take it away! "
After saying that, he had already started to take it away.
That was the Ancestral Dragon's reverse scale, the hardest part of the body.
The third young lady was silent.
Damn, how could this man be so shameless?
.....







Chapter 1475
Seeing that Ye Xuan was really going to pull out the dragon scale, Third Miss hurriedly said, "Young Master Ye!"
Ye Xuan turned to look at Third Miss and blinked. "Third Miss, there's no need to help me. I can do it myself!"
With that, he exerted force and plucked out the dragon scale.
Third Miss was speechless.
Ye Xuan looked at the dragon scale. It wasn't particularly big, but it was abnormally strong. It was at least four to five times stronger than the other dragon scales around it!
Good stuff!
If this thing was made into armor, it would be equivalent to a Dao body!
Ye Xuan was very satisfied!
At this moment, Third Miss suddenly said in a deep voice, "Young Master Ye!"
Ye Xuan looked at Third Miss and smiled. "Third Miss, I won't take this dragon scale for free."
Third Miss looked at Ye Xuan. "Young Master Ye wants to trade something with me?"
Ye Xuan nodded. "If Third Miss likes anything, as long as I have it, I can give it to you!"
Third Miss asked, "Really?"
Ye Xuan nodded.
He wasn't afraid. He was poorer than the Dao sects anyway!
Third Miss said, "I want some Young Master Ye's blood!"
Ye Xuan was stunned. "My blood?"
Third Miss nodded. "Not much. One gourd is enough!"
Ye Xuan's face darkened. That's not much?
One gourd!
I'm not a dragon!
If I let out a gourd of blood, I'm afraid I'll collapse!
Third Miss said lightly, "Young Master Ye is unwilling?"
Ye Xuan hesitated for a moment, then said, "Third Miss, why do you want my blood?"
Third Miss smiled. "I have my uses!"
Ye Xuan was silent.
Third Miss smiled. "Young Master Ye is alive, but my Ancestral Dragon is dead. Young Master Ye's blood can be regenerated, but my Ancestral Dragon's blood can't be regenerated. Young Master Ye …"
Ye Xuan suddenly said, "Third Miss, one gourd of blood is too much!
You're trying to drain me dry! "
Third Miss blinked. "Then just half a gourd!
This gourd is so small. Half a gourd of blood won't have much effect on Young Master Ye! "
Ye Xuan was speechless. He suddenly realized that the dragon scale was a bit hot!
The Third Young Lady walked up to Ye Xuan and said with a smile, "May I?"
Ye Xuan did not speak. He took out a gourd and started to bleed. Soon, half of the gourd was filled with blood.
Ye Xuan. "Third Miss," said, "Ye Third Miss," Ye Xuan said, "Third Xuan," "
Ye Xuan looked at Third Young Lady, "Third Young Lady, what are you doing with my blood?"
The Third Young Lady smiled and said, "Don't worry, I won't use your blood recklessly. I just want to study it. Moreover, your blood might be helpful to my Taoist Body!"
Ye Xuan nodded. "Understood!"
The third girl put away the gourd, "Young master Ye, let's go practice Life Fist!"
With that, she turned around and left.
Ye Xuan glanced at the Third Young Lady and followed her.
On the way, Ye Xuan suddenly asked, "Third Young Lady, as far as I know, this Dao scripture martial art is the origin of all the martial arts in the Myriad World. Then, what was this Dao scripture martial art before?
Or could it be that before the Dao scriptures and martial arts, there wasn't any martial arts civilization? "
The Third Young Lady remained silent.
Ye Xuan asked again, "Can't you tell me?
I still don't know.
Dao? "
Third Young Lady said softly, "Of course I know!"
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "Can you tell me about it?"
The Third Young Lady glanced at Ye Xuan and said, "If you want to know about the civilization before the Dao scripture civilization, then you must first understand the history of our universe!
Our universe, conservatively estimated, should have existed for hundreds of trillions of years!
But the Dao scripture martial art civilization is only 360,000 years old! "
Hearing this, Ye Xuan's expression became solemn.
The Third Young Lady said again, "Compared to this universe, humans are really insignificant. We also know very little about the history of this universe. For example, how it was formed, how humans were born … we know nothing!
Before the Dao scripture martial art civilization, the martial arts civilization of this universe was very, very backward. The people of that era were still in the Body Refining Stage and didn't know how to cultivate Qi. The lifespan of humans was basically less than a hundred years! "
Ye Xuan frowned slightly, "So backward?"
The Third Young Lady nodded, "Very backward!
But the Spiritual Qi in that era was very rich, at least a thousand times richer than it is now. Because the people of that era didn't cultivate Qi, Spiritual Qi was basically useless to them.
Master called that era the primitive era. Whether it was the spiritual civilization or the martial arts civilization, they were the most primitive.
After Master appeared, he created a new cultivation method, which was Qi Cultivation!
Absorbing the Spiritual Qi of Heaven and Earth to strengthen oneself, change oneself, break through oneself … It was also from Master's era that people became more and more powerful, so powerful that they could destroy the world … "
Ye Xuan suddenly asked, "Did the ancestors of the Dao sects teach themselves?"
The Third Young Lady nodded slightly, "Learn and explore by yourself!"
Ye Xuan said softly, "Amazing!"
Creating a new path wasn't something an ordinary person could do!
The Third Young Lady said, "After Master appeared, the cultivation method he created completely changed our universe. However, it also brought a disaster to this universe. Because everyone cultivated, they absorbed Spiritual Qi without restraint, and even plundered the Spiritual Qi of Heaven and Earth, so many worlds were destroyed …"
Saying that, she glanced at Ye Xuan, "The model in the Five-Dimensional Universe is very good. It protects the world, protects the spirit of Heaven and Earth, and forbids the wanton destruction of the strong. In this case, the universe can live longer!"
Ye Xuan said in a deep voice, "Third Young Lady, just now you said that the history of this universe is at least a hundred trillion years, and the Dao Scripture Civilization only has a little more than 30 years. Before the Dao Scripture Civilization was the primitive era. What about before the primitive era?"
The Third Young Lady shook her head, "I don't know!
Because the people of that era didn't even create words, so there was no record at all.
However, Master once calculated that more than 10 million years before the primitive era, there might be an extremely powerful civilization in this universe. "
Ye Xuan hurried to ask, "What civilization?"
The Third Young Lady hesitated, then shook her head, "I don't know!"
After a moment of silence, Ye Xuan asked, "Why did the Dao Sect's ancestor think that more than 10 million years before the primitive era, there was a powerful civilization in this world?"
The Third Young Lady looked at Ye Xuan, "In order to spread Martial Dao, Master once traveled all over the world. He once encountered something unusual in the Northern Wilderness, but I don't know what it was!
I only know that after he came back from there, the Ancestral Dragon that had been accompanying him all along died!
Later, Master personally sealed the Northern Wilderness, and no one was allowed to step into that place. These years, the seal has loosened, and I have entered several times, but I couldn't go deep. That place is indeed not simple …
...”
The Northern Wilderness!
Ye Xuan was silent, and he remembered this place in his heart.
At this time, the Third Young Lady stopped and turned to look at Ye Xuan, "The Dao Scripture Martial Dao Civilization is only the origin of our universe's Martial Dao Civilization, but it is not the only Martial Dao Civilization."
Ye Xuan smiled bitterly, "Third Young Lady, are you trying to tell me that there is a higher dimension world?"
The Third Young Lady asked, "Why not?"
Ye Xuan frowned slightly, "Don't tell me there is really an eighth or ninth dimension?"
The Third Young Lady shook her head, "Do you think there is any difference between the fourth and fifth dimensions?"
Ye Xuan thought for a moment, and shook his head, "There is no difference, just that the Martial Dao Civilization of the fifth dimension is higher than that of the fourth dimension."
Third Young Lady nodded. "Actually, no matter if it's three-dimensional, four-dimensional, or five-dimensional, or even the Saha World, everyone is in the same universe. It's just that someone separated each place and set up a cosmic barrier. That's why there's the so-called four-dimensional and five-dimensional distinction. In the end, everyone belongs to the same universe. It's just that the area is different."
Ye Xuan suddenly asked, "Now, what is the farthest known place in Dao Sect?"
The Third Young Lady looked at Ye Xuan, "The Orc World!"
Ye Xuan frowned slightly, "The Orc World?"
The Third Young Lady nodded, "Another race that has existed since primitive times!
They are actually also humans, but they are a race that is a combination of humans and demons!
They can be said to be the natural enemy of the human race. If it was not for Master's sudden appearance, the human race would have been destroyed by them! "
Ye Xuan was a little surprised, "So strong?"
The Third Young Lady said softly, "Not just strong, they not only have the cultivation talent of the human race, but also the strong physical body of the Orc race, especially in the aspect of physical body. Compared to the human race, they have a unique advantage, and those Orcs who have cultivated their physical body to the extreme are even more terrifying."
She looked at Ye Xuan as she spoke. "Master created the Taoist Physique based on the cultivation method of their threads."
Ye Xuan said, "In other words, the Orcs in the Orc World are more advanced than us humans in terms of physical body?"
The Third Young Lady nodded, "Yes!
Because their physical body has a unique advantage!
Humans may need to cultivate for 20 to 30 years to cultivate a strong physical body, but on the Orcs' side, they may be born with it! "
Ye Xuan said softly, "I understand!"
At this moment, he finally had a rough understanding of this universe.
The universe was very big!
The martial arts civilization did not only consist of the Daoist Scripture civilization. The Daoist Scripture civilization was only the source of the martial arts civilization of this universe, but who knew if there were other universes?
The Third Young Lady said again, "If Young Master Ye wants to know more about the history of this universe, you can go to the Northern Wilderness, but that place is a bit dangerous, Young Master Ye better not go now!
Otherwise, you won't be able to return! "
Ye Xuan was speechless.
At this moment, the Third Young Lady stopped in her tracks. She glanced at her surroundings and said, "Young Master Ye, this is the place where I usually cultivate. The space here is unusually firm, so Young Master Ye can cultivate Fate Fist here. However, I have to remind you that cultivating Fate Fist is playing with your life!
Because you have to burn your lifespan in the beginning … "
Ye Xuan was speechless.
....
PS: I found that everyone has been guessing the identity of that woman recently, I also read the book comments, but no one guessed correctly.







Chapter 1476
Burning one's lifespan!
Ye Xuan was speechless!
This Life Fist was really risking one's life!
Third Miss smiled and said, "However, if you succeed in cultivating it, you will feel that burning your lifespan is worth it!
However, in my opinion, Young Master Ye's lifespan is at most a thousand years … that's too little!
I'm afraid it's not enough for Young Master Ye to successfully cultivate this fist!
So … "
Ye Xuan suddenly said, "Let's try it first!"
Third Miss glanced at Ye Xuan and nodded, "Then let's try it first!"
Saying that, she sat cross-legged on the ground and said, "Young Master Ye, sit down first. Let me tell you about the origin of this Life Fist and its special characteristics."
Ye Xuan nodded and sat cross-legged opposite to Third Miss.
Third Young Lady said, "This Life Fist was created by Master by chance. Originally, he didn't want to incorporate this fist into the martial arts scripture because this fist was too harmful to the harmony of the heavens and its power was too great. Ordinary people couldn't control it.
However, after seeing me cultivate this fist, he changed his mind! "
Ye Xuan blinked, "Why?"
Third Miss looked at Ye Xuan, "Because I can control this Life Fist!"
Ye Xuan was speechless.
Third Miss continued, "This Life Fist burns one's lifespan as the price. It can be said to be an unconventional sword, and because of this unconventional sword, the requirements for the cultivator are extremely harsh. First is the body, because its power is too powerful, ordinary people can't bear its power. If an ordinary person cultivates it, once they use it, they may directly explode and die. Therefore, the cultivator must at least have a Dao body of the Consolidation Realm. Only a Dao body of the Consolidation Realm can bear its power. Second is the soul. In the process of cultivating this fist, the cultivator will have to endure unbearable pain. The soul must be strong enough, otherwise, the soul may be destroyed while cultivating!"
Ye Xuan blinked, "The soul will be destroyed?"
The Third Young Lady nodded. "This fist intent surpasses the limits of ordinary people. Moreover, the power obtained from this fist is unconventional. Therefore, there are many drawbacks!"
As she spoke, she looked at Ye Xuan. "Your physical body is strong enough. As for your Divine Soul, it shouldn't be too big of a problem!
The only problem is his lifespan. His lifespan is a little short, but his comprehension isn't bad, so it shouldn't be a big problem! "
Ye Xuan nodded, "Then let's begin!"
Third Young Lady said, "Now, I will teach you some of my experience in practicing Life Fist. It should be helpful!"
With that, she pointed with her fingers, and a white light directly entered the space between Ye Xuan's eyebrows!
Ye Xuan slowly closed his eyes. Soon, countless pieces of information flowed into his mind.
About an hour later, Ye Xuan began to circulate the ninth volume of Dao Scripture and began to practice the Life Fist!
The moment he activated the ninth manual, a faint flame suddenly appeared around him.
Burning his lifespan!
Needless to say, the price of practicing Life Fist was too high!
Burning his lifespan!
What was the ultimate goal of ordinary people's cultivation?
It was to prolong their lifespan!
But this Life Fist directly burned one's lifespan!
However, Ye Xuan had no choice but to practice!
His top priority now was to do everything possible to improve his strength!
Without great strength, everything else was nonsense!
...
The Sacred Ground.
The Sacred Lord came to the bamboo house in the back of the mountain. In the garden, a woman was slowly watering the plants.
The woman was still wearing that dark green dress!
The Sacred Lord walked to the side of the garden and bowed respectfully, "Master, I received news.
Ye Xuan is practicing in the Dao Sect and has now cultivated his physical body to the Consolidation Realm. Not only that, he is also practicing the Dao Sect's supreme martial art, Life Fist! "
The woman nodded, "Got it!"
The Sacred Lord hesitated, then said, "Aren't we going to stop him?"
The woman smiled, "Why should we stop him?"
The Sacred Lord said in a deep voice, "He is getting stronger and stronger!"
The woman smiled, "I know!"
The Sacred Lord wanted to say something but stopped.
The woman glanced at the Sacred Lord, "Even if his physical body and realm have reached the God Realm, he is not a threat to me!
Do you understand? "
The Sacred Lord shook his head, "No."
The woman smiled, "Whether he lives or not doesn't depend on him. Whether I die or not doesn't depend on him!
This is a game between me and the person behind him. "
The Sacred Lord said softly, "The woman in the plain dress?"
The woman nodded, "The only people who can kill me and dare to kill me are this woman and her father.
It can be said that I only have one chance. If I can't kill him in one strike, I won't have a second chance.
Now, the only thing that can hold them back is the Calamity Cause. Her father is far enough away from here. If I make a move, he will not be able to help.
Of course, the woman in the plain dress is not near here either. However, if I make a move and kill him, I will die too!
A life for a life, that was my idea in the past. Now, I don't want a life for a life because I think it will be too easy for him!
So, I want a life for a few more! "
The Sacred Lord glanced at the woman, his eyes filled with fear.
He knew that the master before him might be doing something crazy.
The woman suddenly stopped and sighed softly, "There's nothing I can do. As long as I want to kill him, no matter what I do, I will definitely die in the end!
However, it doesn't matter. "
The Sacred Lord said in a low voice, "Master … is there no chance of survival?"
The woman shook her head, "There is no chance of survival!"
The Sacred Lord hesitated for a moment and said, "Then why not give up?"
The woman smiled, "There are some things that must be done, even if it means death."
As she spoke, she glanced at the Sacred Lord, "Don't worry too much. I will give you a way out later.
Once Ye Xuan dies, the woman in the plain dress will definitely go mad, and the entire universe will tremble under her sword. Moreover, no one can stop her, not even those two men, because they can't stop a Mandate of Heaven that has lost its mind.
However, there is a place that she will not make a move, and that is the place where her brother died. Only by going there can she survive. "
The Sacred Lord said in a trembling voice, "Master, is that woman really invincible?"
The woman nodded and smiled, "She is!
If it wasn't for the Disaster Cause, I wouldn't have a chance at all!
Even with the Disaster Cause, as long as I touch Ye Xuan, I will definitely die.
However, I am prepared to die! "
The Sacred Lord still wanted to say something, but the woman waved her hand, "You may leave!"
The Sacred Lord did not dare to say anything else. He bowed respectfully and left.
The woman put down the tools in her hand and walked slowly into the bamboo house. There was only a bed, a bamboo table, and a bamboo chair in the bamboo house!
The woman walked to the bamboo table and sat down. She picked up the teapot and poured herself a cup of tea. However, she did not drink it and fell silent.
After a long time, the woman raised the teacup and said softly, "I don't blame him!
However … he must die. "
After saying that, she picked up the teacup and drank it in one gulp. Then, she stood up and left the bamboo house. After walking out of the bamboo house, she gently drew a line with her finger and the space in front of her split open. In the next moment, she entered the split space.
...
The Desolate North.
Very few people knew about the Northern Wilderness because it was a true forbidden area. Even Godly State Experts did not dare to step into this place easily.
There were two reasons why this place was called a forbidden area. First, this place itself was extremely special. Second, there was a restriction set up by the Dao Sect's Patriarch!
Over the years, countless people had entered this place in search of opportunities. However, only a few could come out alive. Even if they did, it was because they did not go deep!
On this day, a woman came to the Northern Wilderness.
It was the mysterious woman from the Sacred Ground!
The mysterious woman slowly walked toward the Northern Wilderness. When she walked to a river, an invisible force suddenly blocked her way!
The mysterious woman waved her lily-white hand and the invisible force instantly disappeared without a trace.
The mysterious woman continued to move forward. Not long after, a mysterious force suddenly enveloped her body.
The mysterious woman smiled slightly. "The Great Path Law …"
As she spoke, she waved her right hand and the mysterious force instantly disappeared without a trace.
The mysterious woman continued to move forward. Soon, she arrived in front of a tall building with 12 floors.
The woman raised her head and looked at the tall building. In the middle of the building, there were three big black words: White Jade Jing!
The woman walked toward the entrance. When she approached the White Jade Jing, a mysterious force suddenly blocked her way. At the same time, a shadow appeared in front of the mysterious woman.
The shadow looked at the woman. "Trespasser: Die!"
The woman suddenly grabbed with her right hand. The next moment, the shadow's throat was directly grabbed by the woman!
He did not even have the strength to fight back!
The woman looked at the shadow and smiled. "I'm not one of those nobodies!"
As she spoke, she clenched her fist.
Boom!
That illusory figure turned into nothingness.
At that moment, the White Jade Jing suddenly trembled.
The mysterious woman smiled slightly and gently stomped her right foot.
Boom!
The entire White Jade Jing shook violently and cracks appeared everywhere. At the same time, the White Jade Jing calmed down.
The mysterious woman looked at the White Jade Jing and shook her head with a smile. "Is this the prehistoric civilization?"
As soon as she spoke, she turned around and left.
At that moment, a voice suddenly sounded from the top floor of the White Jade Jing. "Who is it?"
The mysterious woman stopped in her tracks. The next moment, she turned around and punched.
Boom!
The White Jade Jing suddenly crumbled and turned into fragments that scattered all over the sky.
The moment the White Jade Jing was destroyed, countless souls floated out of it.
The mysterious woman waved her right hand and collected the souls!
At that moment, a ferocious voice suddenly sounded from the sky. "Who is it?
Why don't you dare show your true face? "
From his perspective, he could only see a blurry figure. He could not see the mysterious woman's true face!
The mysterious woman looked up at the sky and smiled. "These souls are very useful to my nephew, Ye Xuan, so I'm taking them with me!
It's an honor for prehistoric people like you to be absorbed by my nephew! "
As soon as she spoke, she turned around and left.
In the sky, the ferocious voice sounded. "Ye Xuan …"
The mysterious woman did not leave. Instead, she continued to go deeper. Along the way, she was unscrupulous and killed everything she passed. However, she did not kill all of them. Instead, she would say, "My nephew, Ye Xuan …"
.....







Chapter 1477
Following the mysterious woman's crazy massacre, the entire Northern Wilderness wailed!
But soon, the mysterious woman escaped!
Because she seemed to be injured!
This made the mysterious forces in the Northern Wilderness heave a sigh of relief. This woman did not seem to be invincible.
However, they still could not do anything to her and could only watch her escape.
Following the mysterious woman's escape, the entire Northern Wilderness returned to peace. But not long after, the Northern Wilderness became lively again as if they were discussing something …
It was worth mentioning that not only did the mysterious woman forcibly take away some of the sleeping souls here, but she also took away countless mysterious treasures … They were all the family properties of those forces …
This was simply robbery!
A blatant robbery!
For a moment, the Northern Wilderness was filled with anger and murderous intent.
...
Dao Sect.
In the cultivation place, Ye Xuan stood quietly with a faint flame burning around him.
Burning his lifespan!
He was now burning his lifespan to obtain great power!
After burning his lifespan, he found that he had indeed obtained a mysterious and powerful power!
The Power of Lifespan!
This power was not cultivated, but burned!
One had to admit that this was indeed an unconventional move!
However, this power was really strong!
Ye Xuan slowly clenched his right hand and the space within tens of thousands of feet around him became illusory. The power in his right hand was still becoming stronger as he burned his lifespan!
The Third Young Lady watched quietly in front of Ye Xuan.
She was actually very curious about Ye Xuan because even if the Dao Sect tried their best, they could not find out Ye Xuan's true identity!
In this universe, there were really not many people that the Dao Sect could not find out.
Most importantly, this guy seemed to have a huge force behind him and the Dao Sect knew nothing about this huge force.
Too mysterious!
At this moment, Ye Xuan suddenly opened his eyes. The clothes on his right arm instantly turned into ashes. Blue veins bulged on his entire right arm, and it was filled with an extremely violent power!
The Power of Lifespan!
Ye Xuan said in a deep voice, "Third Young Lady, I feel that I can't control this power anymore!"
Third Young Lady looked at Ye Xuan. "You must learn to control it!"
Ye Xuan quickly asked, "How do I control it?"
Third Lady said, "Don't burn your lifespan yet."
Ye Xuan nodded and quickly stopped burning his lifespan. Although he had stopped burning his lifespan, the power in his body was still somewhat difficult to control.
He even felt like his body was about to explode!
Because he was too strong!
Moreover, he felt as if his body was about to collapse.
Not only was his physical body on the verge of collapse, but his soul was also on the verge of collapse.
At this time, the Third Young Lady suddenly said, "Although this power is strong, you must know that it is yours!
It was obtained by burning your lifespan, and your lifespan is also yours, so you can try to communicate with it! "
Ye Xuan blinked. "Communicate?"
The Third Young Lady nodded. "Feel it, fuse with it, and make it a part of your body. Only then will you be able to control it completely."
With that, she paused and continued, "The reason why many people in Taoism cannot cultivate this Life Fist is because they have not found a suitable way to control it!"
Ye Xuan nodded. "I will try!"
With that, he slowly closed his eyes and calmed his mind!
Feel that power!
Gradually, Ye Xuan found that although this power was violent and overbearing, it was a little dependent on his body. No, it should be said that it was a little close to his body!
Any power without the support of the body would be like a duckweed without roots!
And this power was created by him, so naturally it was most dependent on him. As long as he used the right method, he could easily control this power.
Ye Xuan began to try to fuse with this power. At first, it was a little difficult, but slowly, he found that this power was not so resistant to him!
Feeling this, Ye Xuan was delighted.
There's hope!
About three days later, Ye Xuan, who was sitting cross-legged on the ground, suddenly stood up. He clenched his right hand, and in an instant, the surrounding space became transparent!
On top of his fist, there was a faint blood-red flame!
Life Fist!
Ye Xuan looked at his fist, his eyes full of excitement.
At this moment, he felt boundless power!
At this time, the Third Young Lady suddenly smiled. "Are you satisfied?"
Ye Xuan looked at the Third Young Lady. The Third Young Lady smiled and said, "Your Life Fist is just a beginner, and its power is not even one-tenth of the real Life Fist!
Not only that, when you burned your lifespan, you only burned 50 years. If you burn for a few hundred years, you will find out what power is! "
Ye Xuan was a little curious. "What if I burn for a thousand years?"
The Third Young Lady smiled and said, "Your current body can't take it. With your current body, you can at most burn 200 years of lifespan, and 200 years of lifespan is enough for you to obtain power far beyond your realm!"
Ye Xuan was a little curious. "How powerful is it exactly?"
He wanted to try, but the price was too high!
200 years of lifespan was not enough to try!
He couldn't afford to try!
The Third Young Lady thought for a moment and said, "If you burn 200 years of lifespan, your power should be able to kill a God State expert easily!
Very, very easily! "
Ye Xuan said in a deep voice, "What is above the God State?"
The Third Young Lady smiled and said, "That's not for you to worry about!
What you should worry about now is the problem of lifespan!
You have to know that you have less than 800 years of lifespan left!
Don't think it's a lot, if you use Life Fist a few more times, it will be gone!
Moreover, your body and soul are not particularly strong. If you use it a few more times, not only will your lifespan not be able to bear it, even your soul and body will not be able to bear it.
So, you need to find a way to improve your body and soul again. "
Ye Xuan looked at the Third Young Lady and the Third Young Lady quickly said, "Don't look at me!
Your Divine Soul and physical body have already reached your limits. It will be extremely difficult for you to improve any further!
I can't help you! "
Ye Xuan was a little curious. "Third Young Lady, what is your body realm?"
The Third Young Lady said, "God State!"
Ye Xuan quickly asked, "How did you reach God State?"
The Third Young Lady looked at Ye Xuan and raised a finger, "I spent 100 years to reach God State!"
100 years!
Ye Xuan was petrified on the spot.
The Third Young Lady smiled and said, "You can also reach God State if you take your time!"
Ye Xuan smiled bitterly, "I also want to, but I'm afraid my enemy will not give me 100 years!"
The Third Young Lady spread her hands, "Then I can't help you!"
After a moment of silence, Ye Xuan cupped his fists, "No matter what, Third Young Lady, thank you!"
The Third Young Lady nodded, "Are you going back now?"
Ye Xuan nodded, "There are still some things waiting for me to deal with in the Fifth Dimension, I have to go back and see if I can improve my soul and body!"
The Third Young Lady nodded slightly, "Your soul may be able to improve, but your body will not be able to improve in a short period of time!
Unless you have a fortuitous encounter, but it is also very difficult. "
Ye Xuan nodded slightly, his body had just broken through to Consolidation Realm, and if he wanted to break through again, as the Third Young Lady said, without a special fortuitous encounter, it would be basically impossible!
In this world, there was basically no beast blood more powerful than the Ancestral Dragon blood!
Even if there was, he was afraid he would not be able to defeat it!
At this time, the Third Young Lady suddenly said, "I still have something to deal with, I will leave first!
If you need anything, or if there is anything you do not understand, you can also come to my Dao Sect! "
Ye Xuan cupped his fists, "Thank you!"
The Third Young Lady nodded slightly, turned around and left.
Ye Xuan suddenly said, "Third Young Lady!"
The Third Young Lady turned to look at Ye Xuan, Ye Xuan smiled, "You said I have a powerful enemy, can you tell me?"
The Third Young Lady thought for a moment, then shook her head, "Young Master Ye, I am sorry, my Dao Sect does not want to get involved in this mess anymore!
Whether it is you or the other party, my Dao Sect cannot afford to offend you, I just want my Dao Sect to develop steadily. "
After saying that, she turned around and left.
In the same place, Ye Xuan was silent.
Who is it that wants to mess with me behind the scenes?
Without thinking much, Ye Xuan turned around and left.
Somewhere, the Third Young Lady looked at Ye Xuan's departing figure, whispering, "I hope we will meet again!"
After saying that, she turned around and left, but after taking two steps, her eyes suddenly narrowed, her right hand suddenly clenched, and a powerful force condensed in her right hand.
A laugh sounded from behind the Third Young Lady, "Miss, you can't beat me!"
The Third Young Lady said softly, "Your Excellency, can't you let my Dao Sect go?"
The voice laughed, "You know he is the person I want to kill, but you still want to help him. You want him to become stronger, and then cause trouble for me, right?"
The Third Young Lady shook her head, "I just want to settle the grudge between my Dao Sect and him, that's all."
The voice was silent.
The Third Young Lady slowly closed her eyes, and the force in her right hand became stronger and stronger.
The atmosphere became more and more tense.
At this moment, the voice suddenly laughed, "Forget it!
Your Master is a respectable person after all, so I won't be so ruthless in this matter!
Miss, don't play such tricks in the future!
Because you don't have a second chance, understand? "
The Third Young Lady nodded, "Boss is right!
I will remember it! "
The voice laughed, "What a smart girl, you are much smarter than that Dao Sect's Second Young Master.
Take care! "
After saying that, the Third Young Lady in the distance suddenly heaved a sigh of relief. She turned around, but there was no one in front of her.
The other party had left!
The Third Young Lady looked at the horizon, and softly said, "Young Master Ye, I mourn for you!"
....
Somewhere in the starry sky, Ye Xuan was flying on his sword!
Returning to the Fifth Dimension!
It had been a while since he came out. Although the threat of the Dao Sect was gone, there were still many things in the Fifth Dimension that he needed to deal with.
At this moment, Ye Xuan suddenly stopped. Not far in front of him stood a woman.
The woman wore a dark green dress, on which there were mountains and rivers, and she looked very quiet and elegant.
Ye Xuan's expression became solemn, because the other party appeared without a sound!
The woman smiled, "Don't be nervous, I am a good person!"
Ye Xuan looked at the woman, "That's what bad people usually say!"
The woman laughed, "You are right!"
Ye Xuan said in a deep voice, "Who are you?"
The woman thought for a while, then said, "You should call me aunt!"
As she said that, the corner of her mouth slightly raised, "The kissing kind!"
Ye Xuan, "…"
...
PS: I'm late!
Let me tell you slowly!
It was dusk, and I passed by a dark alley. In the alley, there were a few people in revealing clothes … These people waved at me … Out of curiosity, I walked over, and then …







Chapter 1478
Aunty!
Dear!
Ye Xuan was confused.
The woman smiled. "It's normal that you don't know me. This is the first time we've met!"
Ye Xuan looked at the woman. "Are you really my aunty?"
The woman nodded. "Yes."
Ye Xuan asked. "How do you prove it?"
The woman smiled. "I really don't know!"
Ye Xuan looked at the woman in silence.
The woman thought for a while. "But you can ask me some questions. I think I should be able to answer them."
Ye Xuan asked. "Who is Qing 'er?"
The woman smiled. "Her name is Tian Ming!
She comes from the three-dimensional universe!
Moreover, the current woman in a plain dress wasn't her true body. Of course, her current strength had already far surpassed her previous body!
Besides her, there is also that woman in white. Her name is Tu. She used to be the owner of the Executing Heaven Sword. She is also Qing 'er, one of the four doppelgangers. "
Ye Xuan said in a deep voice, "Where are the other two?"
The woman said softly. "The other two were killed by Qing 'er a long time ago!"
Ye Xuan frowned. "Why?"
The woman looked at Ye Xuan. "Because the two Qing 'er obstructed her, so she killed them!"
Ye Xuan was curious. "What obstructed Qing 'er?"
The woman smiled. "Because!
Qing 'er wanted to defy the heavens and change her fate. But the prerequisite was to destroy the Dao. So she chose to destroy all living beings. The other two tried to stop her, so she killed them! "
Ye Xuan was silent.
The woman gently brushed her hair behind her ear. "What else do you want to ask?"
Ye Xuan looked at the woman. "Who is my father?"
The woman smiled. "It's not convenient for me to tell you!
You will know in the future! "
Ye Xuan asked again. "What about my mother?"
The woman smiled, "Mother is not an ordinary person, very extraordinary!
In fact, there's another bloodline in my body, but it hasn't been activated yet! "
Ye Xuan frowned. "There's another bloodline?"
The woman nodded. "Yes!
It was a very powerful bloodline!
However, that ability had yet to be awakened!
Moreover, the current Crazy Demon Bloodline is too overbearing. It directly suppresses that bloodline, so it can't awaken! "
Ye Xuan said solemnly, "I have two bloodlines!"
The woman said with a smile, "Yes!
Moreover, the other bloodline is also very strong. Of course, in terms of power, it can't compare to the Crazy Demon Bloodline. However, the other bloodline is a little special. Its function is not to increase strength! "
Ye Xuan was a little curious. "Is that a support type?"
The woman nodded. "You can say so!"
Ye Xuan asked in a deep voice, "Is it powerful?"
The woman smiled and said, "Definitely powerful!"
Ye Xuan asked, "How do I activate it?"
The woman blinked. "Do you want to activate it?"
Ye Xuan nodded.
The woman smiled and said, "I'll help!"
With that, she walked in front of Ye Xuan. Ye Xuan's right hand slowly clenched, his heart secretly on guard!
The woman shook her head and smiled, "Don't be on guard against me. If I want to kill, you can't stop me!
Even if you burn a thousand years of your lifespan to use that Life Fist, you're still not my opponent! "
Ye Xuan looked straight at the woman, "How do you know that I practice Life Fist!"
The woman smiled and said, "Because I've been secretly observing!"
Ye Xuan asked, "Observing me for what?"
The woman blinked, "As an aunt, what's wrong with observing my nephew?"
Ye Xuan was silent.
The woman smiled and said, "Do you want to activate your bloodline?"
Ye Xuan was still silent.
The woman shook her head and smiled, "It seems that you still don't believe me!
In that case, you can use your Life Fist to hit me! "
Ye Xuan looked at the woman, "Then I won't be polite!"
With that, he suddenly swung his sword!
Instant Kill Sword!
He had cultivated this Instant Kill Sword to the limit. Even if he didn't use the Supreme Sword, its speed and power had reached the limit.
Moreover, he was so close to this woman. Even if this woman was a peak God Realm expert, she would absolutely not be able to block this sword!
However, Ye Xuan was stunned.
Because his sword was clamped by two fingers!
The woman's fingers!
The woman clamped Ye Xuan's sword and said with a smile, "A very fast sword!
Unfortunately, this speed is still not a threat to me. "
With that, she loosened her fingers.
Ye Xuan was silent.
He knew that this woman's strength far exceeded his. Just like what she said, if she wanted to kill him, he couldn't resist at all!
The woman smiled and said, "Now do you believe me?"
Ye Xuan looked at the woman, "Why are you looking for me?"
The woman blinked her eyes, "Someone asked me to help you because you're too weak now!
So weak, you won't be able to resist the Calamity Cause in the future! "
Ye Xuan was stunned and then said, "Someone asked you to help me?"
The woman nodded, "Yes!"
Ye Xuan asked, "Who is it?"
The woman smiled and said, "Someone I know very well!
As for who it is, I won't tell you!
In any case, I'm here to help! "
Ye Xuan glanced at the woman, "How?"
The woman sized up Ye Xuan and said, "First, I have to help you activate the power of your bloodline and activate the power of another bloodline!
Secondly, your soul is slightly weak, so I can help you improve it and bring it to a new height! "
Ye Xuan was slightly surprised, "You can help me improve my soul?"
The woman nodded, "Yes!"
Ye Xuan hesitated for a moment and asked, "Really?"
The woman smiled and said, "What's in it for me to lie to you?"
Ye Xuan fell silent.
He didn't know if this woman was his aunt, but an expert like her wouldn't joke with him, right?
Moreover, she knew Qing 'er and the others so well, so she was obviously from the three-dimensional universe!
The woman suddenly said, "I'll activate your bloodline first!
Of course, if you really don't believe me, then you don't have to activate it. I'm busy anyway! "
Ye Xuan looked at the woman, "Will the two bloodlines conflict with each other if I activate the other bloodline?"
The woman smiled and said, "Conflict or not, it depends on you!"
Ye Xuan frowned slightly, "Depends on me?"
The woman nodded, "Remember, whether it's the Crazy Demon bloodline or the other bloodline, it's their master, not the other way around. Understand?"
Ye Xuan said solemnly, "I understand!"
The woman smiled and said, "Can we start now?"
Ye Xuan hesitated and said, "Are you really my mother's sister?"
The woman nodded, "Yes!"
Ye Xuan looked straight at the woman, "In other words, you have the same bloodline as me, right?"
The woman smiled slightly, "Yes!"
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "Can you show me?"
The woman laughed, "Little fellow, you're really cautious, but it's a good thing!"
As soon as she finished speaking, she opened her palm, and in the next moment, an emerald light suddenly appeared around her body. Not only that, but Ye Xuan also noticed that the blood vessels on her right hand had suddenly bulged!
Those were emerald green blood vessels!
Ye Xuan was slightly curious, "What bloodline is this?"
The woman blinked, "Immortal Bloodline!"
Ye Xuan frowned slightly, "Immortal Bloodline?"
The woman smiled and said, "Immortal Bloodline. Once activated, it possesses extremely terrifying self-healing abilities!
If cultivated to the extreme, so long as it's not erased in a single move, then no matter how serious the injury is, it can be healed!
Even if the physical body is shattered, this bloodline can automatically restore the physical body. Not only the physical body, but even if the soul is shattered, it can instantly reform.
Simply put, so long as it's not directly erased by the opponent, then it won't die. "
Ye Xuan was stunned, and then he said, "It's that terrifying?"
The woman nodded and smiled, "It's that terrifying!
It can be said that after this bloodline is activated, there are very, very few people in this world who can kill it besides those true almighty experts. Or perhaps it's even difficult to die! "
Ye Xuan spoke in a low voice, "What kind of almighty experts are you talking about?"
The woman pointed at herself, "For example, my kind!"
Ye Xuan was speechless.
The woman continued, "There's also the Qing 'er kind!
No bloodline is of any use when she slashes down with her sword!
Because she can sever everything with a single slash of her sword, and she can truly erase a person. "
Ye Xuan nodded, "I understand!"
As he spoke, he looked at the woman, "Help me activate my bloodline!"
The woman smiled and said, "Alright!"
As soon as she finished speaking, she opened her palm and pressed it lightly on Ye Xuan's shoulder.
Bang!
In an instant, Ye Xuan's body trembled violently, and then the blood in his body suddenly started trembling violently!
The Crazy Demonic Bloodline was resisting!
The woman smiled slightly, "I have to suppress the Crazy Demonic Bloodline first. I have to cooperate and don't resist, otherwise, it won't let the other bloodline awaken!"
As she spoke, she gently exerted force with her right hand.
Bang!
In an instant, the Crazy Demonic Bloodline in Ye Xuan's body was directly suppressed by a powerful force!
Sensing this scene, Ye Xuan's expression became solemn!
This woman's strength was so terrifying!
She could actually suppress the Crazy Demonic Bloodline so easily!
At this moment, the woman smiled and gently raised her right hand —
Bang!
Ye Xuan's eyes widened. At this moment, he felt as if something was about to come out of his body!
Gradually, some dark green light appeared around his body!
Immortal Bloodline!
And Ye Xuan found that the blood in his body gradually began to turn emerald green.
His blood was changing!
Ye Xuan slowly closed his eyes, and at this moment, he felt like he was floating!
Because the power of the bloodline was a little comfortable!
The Crazy Demonic Bloodline was very powerful, but it could not be controlled. Moreover, people would go crazy, and that kind of feeling was really not good!
But this bloodline was different. This bloodline gave him a very comfortable feeling!
Gradually, the blood in Ye Xuan's body slowly transformed.
And during this process, Ye Xuan did not feel any discomfort.
After a long time, Ye Xuan seemed to have thought of something. He looked at the woman, "Just now, you said that you can help me improve my soul?"
The woman nodded, "Yes!"
Ye Xuan was a little curious, "How do you improve it?"
The woman smiled, "Using souls to supplement souls!"
Ye Xuan frowned slightly, "Using souls to supplement souls?"
The woman nodded, "Not long ago, I picked up a batch of powerful souls. After absorbing them, I should be able to break through the limit of my soul!
En, when I leave, I will also leave behind a fortune, enough to help change the entire Five-Dimensional Universe. "
Ye Xuan blinked his eyes, "Fortune!"
The woman smiled, "No matter what, you are my nephew, I will definitely treat you well!"
.....







Chapter 1479
Aunty!
Ye Xuan glanced at the woman. He was now certain that this woman was related to his mother!
Because his new bloodline power was the same as this woman's bloodline power!
Moreover, the other party could know so many things!
Was the other party really here to help him?
His intuition told him that things might not be so simple!
But he couldn't tell what was wrong!
At this time, the mysterious woman smiled slightly, "Don't think too much, feel the bloodline!"
Ye Xuan nodded and slowly closed his eyes.
At this moment, his whole body was warm and very, very comfortable.
He had to admit that he was a little excited at this moment!
If this Immortal Bloodline was really so abnormal, then with his Daoist Physique, who could kill him?
Moreover, he also had the Ancestral Dragon's Scale. Once the scale was forged into a treasured armor, it could be said that his physical body would be extremely tough. Even if he stood there and let a Consolidation Realm expert slash at him, the opponent would not be able to kill him!
Thinking of this, Ye Xuan looked forward to it even more!
With the help of the woman, the Mad Demon Bloodline in his body had been completely suppressed, and the new bloodline was slowly taking over his body. After the bloodline had been dormant for more than 20 years, it was even happier than Ye Xuan himself when it regained its freedom!
About half an hour later, the woman withdrew her hand. She retreated to the side and said with a smile, "It's done!"
Ye Xuan opened his eyes and clenched his fists. In an instant, the blood in his body quickly flowed from his body, and an emerald light appeared around him.
It was very comfortable!
Ye Xuan looked at the woman, "My bloodline activation was successful?"
The woman nodded, "Yes!"
Ye Xuan hesitated for a moment, then asked, "Then what about my Crazy Demon Bloodline?"
The woman said with a smile, "The Crazy Demon Bloodline did not disappear, but it was temporarily suppressed by me. In the future, when you need to use it, it will naturally appear, but under normal circumstances, it won't be used, right?"
Ye Xuan nodded, "That's true!"
The woman continued, "Actually, the two bloodlines can coexist, but I'm afraid it's a little difficult to control right now, so I can only separate them and slowly try to control them in the future!
It will be very interesting if the two bloodlines can coexist because the Undying Bloodline can make up for the flaws of the Mad Demon Bloodline. "
Ye Xuan nodded. "I understand!"
The Mad Demon Bloodline was equivalent to self-mutilation, but the Undying Bloodline could restore the body!
Meanwhile, the woman spoke abruptly, "We'll slowly comprehend the bloodline energy in the future!
Let me help you improve your Divine Soul! "
As she spoke, she opened her palm and a white jade bottle appeared in her hand.
Ye Xuan was a little curious. "This is?"
The woman smiled and said, "Soul body!
A very powerful soul body! "
A soul body!
Ye Xuan glanced at it, and soon, his expression became unprecedentedly solemn!
There were at least tens of thousands of souls inside!
These souls were at least at the peak of the Immortal State, and many of them might have surpassed the Immortal State!
Ye Xuan looked at the woman in shock, "These are?"
The woman smiled faintly, "They were all bad people, and I killed them.
En, I've erased all their memories, and now they're a great tonic for you. After absorbing these souls, your Divine Soul should reach a very terrifying level! "
Ye Xuan looked at the white jade bottle and did not speak.
The woman smiled, "Are you worried?"
Ye Xuan looked at the woman.
"These souls are too powerful!"
The woman laughed, "If they're not powerful, it's useless to absorb them!"
Ye Xuan was silent.
The woman smiled, "It seems that you still think I'll harm you!
Really, I'm in critical condition. If I make a move now, other than my Qing 'er, no one will be able to save him!
You should know that I'm not lying, right? "
Ye Xuan was still silent.
The woman shook her head and smiled, "Little guy, I said so much because you're my nephew. If you want to become stronger, it's not impossible to ignore these souls. I won't force you!"
With that, she put away the white jade bottle.
Ye Xuan suddenly asked, "Where is my mother now?"
The woman smiled, "A very far place!"
Ye Xuan asked, "How far?"
The woman thought for a moment and said, "I don't know, but it's very, very far. Father is the same. Many people are helping to fight against the Cause of Calamity."
With that, she raised the white jade bottle in her hand, "Do you want it or not?
The souls of over 10,000 super experts can not only make my Divine Soul stronger, it can also make my Soul Subduing Sword achieve a qualitative change! "
Ye Xuan smiled, "Yes!"
The woman passed the white jade bottle to Ye Xuan. Ye Xuan took the white jade bottle, but he did not absorb it immediately.
The woman blinked, "If you absorb it now, I can help you improve!"
Ye Xuan smiled, "There's no hurry, Aunty. Didn't you say that you have some treasures for me?"
The woman smiled, "Of course!"
With that, she took out a Spatial Ring and handed it to Ye Xuan.
Ye Xuan glanced at the Mustardseed Ring. Soon, his expression turned serious!
The woman smiled, "Moved?"
Ye Xuan looked at the woman and nodded.
The treasures in the Spatial Ring were enough to change the entire Fifth Dimension!
They could make the Fifth Dimension reach an unprecedented level!
The woman looked around, "I should also go!
Take care of yourself! "
Ye Xuan looked at the woman, "Where are you going?"
The woman smiled, "A very far place. We'll meet again in the future!"
With that, she turned and left.
Under Ye Xuan's gaze, the woman disappeared into the horizon.
In the same place, Ye Xuan looked at the white jade bottle and the Spatial Ring in his hand.
At this time, Ye Zhiming suddenly said, "You don't believe this woman?"
Ye Xuan nodded.
Ye Zhiming was a little confused, "Why?"
Ye Xuan said softly, "One who is unaccountably solicitous is hiding evil intentions.
My soul is not strong enough, and then someone immediately came to give me powerful souls for me to absorb … My Fifth Dimension wants to develop, and then someone came to give me so many treasures that can change the entire Fifth Dimension … Is this a coincidence?
Maybe it is, but I can't be too cautious!
If someone dug a hole for me, wouldn't it be a pain in the ass? "
Ye Zhiming said in a low voice, "Do you think she is Little Aunt?"
Ye Xuan looked at his body, then said, "She has the same bloodline as me, so it should be true. However, her appearance is a little suspicious.
Also … "
As he spoke, he looked at the white jade bottle and Storage Ring in front of him. "I can tell at a glance that these powerful souls are not simple, and with these treasures … I think she might have gone to rob a powerful force … Anyway, I have to be more careful.
When the time comes, I will go to the Nether Palace and ask that Big Aunt if she knows this Little Aunt. If she does, then she is really one of us, that would be for the best. If she doesn't … "
At this point, he did not continue!
Ye Zhiming also fell silent.
Neither of them wanted to think about the worst!
At this time, Ye Xuan said, "I will go to the Nether Palace now!"
With that, he was about to leave, but at this moment, the white jade bottle in his hand suddenly shattered, and the next moment, countless souls rushed into his forehead like a tide.
Boom!
Ye Xuan's body trembled violently, and a powerful soul aura swept out from his body, causing the space around him to tremble like an earthquake!
It's over!
This was the thought in Ye Xuan's mind at this moment.
The other party actually used force!
This was definitely a trap!
Damn it!
Is this woman really my Little Aunt?
....
On the other side, the mysterious woman looked at Ye Xuan in the distance, a faint smile on her face, "What a cautious guy, I actually failed to trick him!
However, this karma, I have to accept it even if I don't want to … "
...
Not far away, Ye Xuan was madly absorbing those souls, not because he wanted to, but because he had to!
If he did not absorb those souls, they would burst his body!
He had to absorb them!
Not only did he have to absorb them himself, but he also had to use the Soul Suppressing Sword to help him!
Because those souls were too powerful!
Just like this, after about four hours, the soul aura around Ye Xuan finally calmed down, and beside him, the Soul Suppressing Sword trembled violently, emitting a powerful soul aura that could really destroy the world!
The Soul Suppressing Sword had broken through and reached an unprecedented level of strength!
Even Ye Xuan did not know what level it had reached!
In any case, there was only one word to describe it: powerful!
And his own Divine Soul was also unprecedentedly strong!
After his Divine Soul became stronger, he realized that with a thought, his divine sense could cover a radius of millions of miles, and he could even clearly sense an ant within millions of miles!
At this moment, he felt that the whole world had become clear!
This feeling was too wonderful!
But soon, Ye Xuan's face darkened!
Why did that woman do this?
Moreover, he had the same bloodline as her, which meant that she might really be his Little Aunt!
Since she was his Little Aunt, why would she do this?
Dig a hole for him?
Ye Xuan was silent.
Although his Divine Soul had greatly improved, he could not feel happy at all!
Because his intuition told him that this was not a good thing!
At this moment, Ye Zhiming suddenly said, "But if that woman really wanted to die, she could have just killed him, why would she dig a hole for him?"
Ye Xuan shook his head, "That's what I'm confused about!"
Ye Zhiming said solemnly, "Do you want to use the treasures in the Storage Ring?"
Ye Xuan looked at the Storage Ring and said softly, "I do!
I've already absorbed these souls anyway!
If there's bad karma, even if I don't use this Storage Ring, I'm afraid it's useless. "
Saying so, he looked at the horizon, "Go back!"
Then, he turned into a sword light and disappeared into the horizon.
In the clouds, the woman looked at Ye Xuan in the distance with a complicated look in her eyes, "So similar …"
.....
PS: Did anyone force me to have a monthly ticket?







Chapter 1480
The Five-Dimensional Universe.
After returning to the Five-Dimensional Universe, Ye Xuan immediately called Bai Dizi.
In the hall, Bai Dizi looked at the storage ring in Ye Xuan's hand with a solemn expression. "These treasures …"
Ye Xuan smiled. "Shocked, right?"
Bai Dizi nodded.
Ye Xuan said softly, "I'm shocked too!"
As he said that, he told them about the mysterious woman!
After listening to Ye Xuan's words, Bai Dizi immediately shook his head. "This woman's purpose is not pure!"
Ye Xuan asked, "Why do you think so?"
Bai Dizi said in a deep voice, "She may really be related to you, but if it was for your own good, she would never force you to absorb those souls. Moreover, don't you think her appearance is a bit too coincidental?"
Ye Xuan nodded and said in a deep voice, "I think so too!
However, with her strength, it should be easy for her to kill me. If she wanted to deal with me, there is really no need for her to do these fancy things! "
Bai Dizi shook his head. "You can't think like that!"
Ye Xuan looked at Bai Dizi. Bai Dizi said in a deep voice, "It's easy to kill you, but what about after killing you?
Can she live? "
As he said that, he shook his head. "After the other party kills you, she definitely can't live. At least she will be retaliated."
Ye Xuan shook his head. He really couldn't figure out the woman's purpose.
Bai Dizi said again, "However, I also don't quite understand the other party's purpose!
Because since the other party knows how powerful the woman in the plain dress is, but still dared to deal with you like this, it is definitely not normal.
In any case, you have to be careful! "
Ye Xuan nodded.
He was most worried about the mysterious enemy that the third young lady mentioned. If the previous aunt was the mysterious enemy that the third young lady mentioned, then it would be a bit of a pain in the ass!
Bai Dizi suddenly said, "Right!
Miss An and Miss Xiao Qi have reached the Consolidation Realm! "
Consolidation Realm!
Ye Xuan was stunned, and then he said, "That fast?"
Bai Dizi smiled and said, "It's mainly because of Xuan City's help. Of course, the main reason is that Miss An and Miss Xiao Qi are too talented."
Ye Xuan nodded.
Xiao Qi and An Lanxiu's talent was definitely not inferior to his.
Bai Dizi continued, "Other than the two of them, Jialou, Aro, and Lady Jiu are also showing signs of breaking through."
Ye Xuan suddenly asked, "Where are A Mu and the others?"
Bai Dizi said, "You mean High Priest A Mu of the Wu Clan?"
Ye Xuan nodded.
Of course, he did not forget this woman. He was her servant.
Bai Dizi said, "The Wu Clan has always been our focus. As for Miss A Mu, she has already reached the Dao Attainment Realm. However, it will be a little difficult for her to reach the Consolidation Realm!
Of course, Miss A Mu's strength is not cultivation talent, but her intelligence. I have formed a cabinet, which is filled with some outstanding people in our Fifth Dimension. Miss A Mu is one of them. Many of the policies were proposed by Miss A Mu! "
Ye Xuan smiled slightly. "I'll go see her!"
Bai Dizi nodded. "Okay!"
Ye Xuan left the hall and went to the hall where Bai Dizi worked, which was the Daoist Temple.
This Daoist Temple was where Bai Dizi usually worked!
At this time, a group of people were busy in the temple. There were men and women, and there were more than fifty people!
They were all people that Bai Dizi had carefully selected!
These people might not be very strong, but their intelligence was top-notch. It could be said that these people were the brains of the Fifth Dimension.
When Ye Xuan walked into the hall, everyone in the hall raised their heads to look at Ye Xuan. When they saw that it was Ye Xuan, they immediately stopped what they were doing and stood up to greet him!
Ye Xuan smiled slightly. "You guys continue with your work!"
As he said this, he looked at a woman in the corner and smiled. "My high priest, shall we go out for a walk?"
A Mu looked at Ye Xuan. After a while, she smiled sweetly. "Okay!"
The two left the hall.
Ye Xuan
(This chapter is not finished, please continue to the next page)
He brought A Mu to the city. At this time, Dao City was very prosperous. The streets were filled with people, and the majority of them were cultivators. Moreover, they were very strong.
This was because there were two attractive places in Dao City. First, there were complete versions of Dao scriptures. Second, the headquarters of the Fifth Dimension Academy was located here.
All the major powers in the universe wanted to send their people to the Fifth Dimension Academy. This included the ancient super powers like the Nanyue family and the Gu family. This was because the temptation of Dao scriptures was too great!
Although they had obtained some of the contents of Dao scriptures, their cultivation methods and martial arts were still in the hands of Ye Xuan.
As for the Whirling School, although they also had it, they didn't dare to spread it. Therefore, if one wanted to learn Dao Scriptures, martial arts, and Dao Scriptures, there were only two places. One was the Fifth Dimension, and the other was the Dao Sect!
However, Dao Gate was not open to the public. Therefore, they could only come to the Fifth Dimension.
At this time, A Mu suddenly said in a soft voice, "I thought you had forgotten about me!"
Ye Xuan collected his thoughts and smiled. "How could I forget about you?
Even if I forget about myself, I will not forget about you! "
A Mu turned her head and looked at Ye Xuan. A moment later, her expression became somewhat complicated. "You have grown so fast!"
Ye Xuan turned his head to look at A Mu and smiled. "No matter how fast I grow, I will always be your witch's servant!"
A Mu stopped and looked at Ye Xuan. "Are you still my witch's servant?"
Ye Xuan looked straight at A Mu. "I will be your witch's servant for a lifetime!
Not only your witch's servant, but also the Wu Clan's witch's servant. "
A Mu looked at Ye Xuan for a long time. After a long time, she suddenly pulled Ye Xuan's hand and smiled. "You must remember what you said!"
Ye Xuan held A Mu's hand. "I never lie to my own people!"
The corner of A Mu's mouth rose. "The witch's servant I found is the strongest in the history of the Wu Clan."
Ye Xuan laughed.
A Mu suddenly said softly, "Meeting you and choosing you is my fortune, and also the Wu Clan's fortune!"
Ye Xuan shook his head. "Meeting you is my fortune!"
A Mu smiled mischievously. "Do you really think so?"
Ye Xuan smiled. "I told you.
I never lie to my own people! "
A Mu blinked. "I'm one of your own people?"
Ye Xuan nodded. "Yes!"
A Mu smiled. "Thank you.
Actually, at first I really thought you had forgotten about me!
I didn't dare to look for you because I was afraid you would really forget about me!
I just didn't expect you to take the initiative to look for me! "
Ye Xuan said softly, "I'm sorry."
A Mu shook her head. "I know you are very busy. Moreover, the enemies are getting stronger and stronger."
As she said that, she looked at Ye Xuan. "Do we still have powerful enemies?"
Ye Xuan nodded. "Yes!"
A Mu sighed softly. "When will it end?"
Ye Xuan smiled. "It's fine. I'll carry it!"
As he said that, he pulled A Mu to the noodle shop. He looked at the owner of the noodle shop and said with a smile, "Boss, two bowls of noodles!"
The owner laughed. "Sir, please wait a moment!
I'll be right there! "
As Ye Xuan and A Mu took their seats, many people around them looked over, mainly at A Mu!
A Mu was a great beauty. Coupled with her gentle personality, she gave people a very comfortable feeling.
Soon, two bowls of noodles were served.
Ye Xuan looked at A Mu and said with a smile, "I especially like eating noodles!"
A Mu blinked. "Were you poor when you were young?"
Ye Xuan smiled. "You investigated me?"
A Mu nodded.
Ye Xuan looked at the noodles in front of him. At that moment, he thought of Ye Ling again!
He did not know how that little girl was doing now!
However, with that mysterious senior around, Ye Ling's safety would definitely not be a problem.
At that moment, laughter suddenly came from the side. "What a beautiful woman!"
Hearing that, Ye Xuan frowned slightly. He turned his head and saw a young man walking over slowly from afar.
The man was wearing a purple brocade robe.
(If this chapter is not finished, please continue to the next page.)
There was a piece of green jade tied to his waist. The jade was the size of a palm and emitted a dark green glow. It was obvious that it was no ordinary item.
And in his right hand, he held a long sword.
The man was handsome and dressed luxuriously. The moment he appeared, he attracted the attention of many people, especially women.
Many women around looked at the man with smiles on their faces and covered their mouths as they whispered.
Actually, the man's looks were secondary. The most important thing was that the man was carrying a sword!
One look and you could tell that he was a Swordsman!
It should be known that the most popular person in the entire Fifth Dimension was a Swordsman!
This was because the Master of the Fifth Dimension, who was also the dean of the Fifth Dimension Academy, Ye Xuan, was a Swordsman.
Behind the young man, there was an old man. The old man carried a sword and his eyes were as sharp as an eagle's. One look and you could tell that he was an expert!
The man slowly walked to the side of Ye Xuan and A Mu. He looked at A Mu and smiled. "Miss, there is still an empty seat here. May I sit here?"
A Mu looked at a certain badge on the man's chest. She smiled and shook her head. "It's not convenient!"
The man was not angry. He smiled and said, "Miss, let me introduce myself. I am Nanmu Chuan!"
"Nanmu Chuan!"
As soon as the man's voice fell, there was a cry of surprise!
"Oh my god!
He's that Nanmu Chuan! "
"It's really him!
He's Nanmu Chuan from the number one family in the South, the Nanmu family! "
"The number one swordsman of the South, Nanmu Chuan …"
"I heard that his overall score reached nine stars!"
"Nine stars … So he's here to join the Fifth Dimension Academy's headquarters?"
"That's for sure …"
Fifth Dimension Academy!
In front of A Mu, Ye Xuan blinked his eyes and looked at Nanmu Chuan. "You're from the Fifth Dimension Academy?"
Nanmu Chuan looked at Ye Xuan. "Let me correct you. I'm currently from the Fifth Dimension Academy's headquarters!"
Ye Xuan pointed at himself. He was a little puzzled. "You don't know me?"
Nanmu Chuan smiled. "Should I know you?"
Ye Xuan turned to look at A Mu. A Mu covered her mouth and chuckled. She used her mystical qi to transmit her voice. "Every academy has a statue of you and Miss Nian Nian. However, that statue is a little exaggerated. In addition, you're wearing too ordinary clothes. Moreover, your aura is restrained and you don't have the aura of a ruler. Therefore, it's normal that he doesn't know you!
In fact, it's not just them. Many people in the city don't really know you. Because you spend very little time in the city, people rarely come into contact with you. Even if they see you, they won't think of you immediately. "
Ye Xuan was speechless. He was too low-key!
At this time, Nanmu Chuan looked at A Mu. "How should I address you, miss?"
A Mu smiled. She pointed at Ye Xuan. "Do you know who he is?"
Nanmu Chuan glanced at Ye Xuan. He smiled. "I don't know!
I don't want to know either. "
A Mu was a little curious. "Why?"
Nanmu Chuan smiled. "Miss, forgive me for being blunt. He's not worthy of you!"
Ye Xuan lowered his head and ate his noodles. He didn't say anything.
This was too tragic!
His position as the master of the Fifth Dimension was really too tragic!
It was fine if outsiders didn't know him!
But no one in the city had noticed him!
When he got back, he had to have a good talk with Bai Dizi.
Nanmu Chuan looked at A Mu. "Miss, do you really not want to get to know me?
I feel that if you don't get to know me, first of all, I will feel very regretful. Second, I feel that this is a loss for you. "
A Mu gently kicked Ye Xuan. She was a little dissatisfied. "My Witch's Servant, stop eating!"
Ye Xuan wiped his mouth and looked at Nanmu Chuan. "She's my High Priestess, and I'm her Witch's Servant. She won't get to know another man."
Nanmu Chuan shook his head and smiled. He took out a storage ring and placed it in front of Ye Xuan. "There are a hundred Fortune Divine Crystals inside. There's also a scroll of my Sword Dao mental cultivation method and insights. It's enough to change your fate. Leave her, and these are all yours!"
Ye Xuan: "…"

Chapter 1481
One hundred Fortune Divine Crystals!
Ye Xuan was speechless.
'Dammit, I still have a few hundred million in my storage ring!'
A Mu covered her mouth and snickered. At this moment, she did not look like a High Priestess. Instead, she looked like a young girl in love.
When Nanmu Chuan saw that Ye Xuan did not speak, he took out another storage ring. "Two hundred Fortune Divine Crystals!"
Two hundred!
Ye Xuan was about to speak when Nanmu Chuan threw out another storage ring. "One thousand Fortune Divine Crystals!"
One thousand!
Someone exclaimed in surprise!
One thousand Fortune Divine Crystals was not a small amount!
One should know that the most common crystals in the market were ordinary crystals. Only some of the major forces had Fortune Divine Crystals!
There was another reason why many people racked their brains to enter the Fifth Dimensions Academy. The academy would provide them with Fortune Divine Crystals!
For an ordinary person, one thousand Fortune Divine Crystals was enough to change their fate!
Ye Xuan looked at Nanmu Chuan and smiled. "So what if you're rich?"
Nanmu Chuan smiled. "Being rich isn't necessarily a big deal. But without money, one must be a coward. What do you think?"
Ye Xuan shook his head and smiled. "You're right. Without money, one must be a coward.
But I don't understand. Didn't your academy teach you how to behave?
First of all, it's rude of you to interrupt us while we're eating noodles. Secondly, you insulted me with money. That's very tasteless.
I remember there's a rule in the academy. Disciples are not allowed to bully the weak or … "
Nanmu Chuan suddenly interrupted Ye Xuan. "I'm sorry. There's no such rule in the academy!"
Ye Xuan looked at Nanmu Chuan. "Then there's one now!
I said it! "
Nanmu Chuan narrowed his eyes. He had already noticed that something was wrong.
A Mu was also silent.
She knew that Ye Xuan was a little angry.
Bullying the weak was what Ye Xuan hated the most. Simply put, bullying the weak and fearing the strong.
Nanmu Chuan looked at Ye Xuan and said with a smile, "Looks like you're not an ordinary person!
However, aren't you a little too arrogant? Do you think you can change the academy's rules just because you say so? "
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "I think we should give people a chance to turn over a new leaf!
Now, apologize, apologize to both of us, sincerely apologize, and we will forgive you!
What do you think? "
Nanmu Chuan laughed. "Sir, you think too highly of yourself."
Ye Xuan faintly smiled. "Then I will now announce that you are disqualified from entering the Fifth Dimensions Academy!"
Nanmu Chuan looked at Ye Xuan and the smile on his face gradually disappeared. "Who the hell are you?!"
He was not stupid. At this moment, he already felt that something was wrong.
Just as Ye Xuan was about to speak, a voice sounded out from the side. "Brother Nanmu, this person sure is arrogant."
Ye Xuan turned his head and saw a man striding over from afar!
Nanmu Chuan was slightly surprised when he saw this person. Then, he smiled and said, "Oh, it's Brother Fang Jin!"
"Fang Jin!"
Someone in the crowd exclaimed, "He's also Fang Jin who passed the Nine Stars Academy!"
This time, there were only two people from the South who were admitted into the Fifth Dimensions Academy. One of them was Nanmu Chuan, and the other was Fang Jin. These two people belonged to the same academy in the South!
Fang Jin cupped his fists at Nanmu Chuan and then looked at Ye Xuan. He smiled and said, "Did you just say that you want to disqualify Nanmu Chuan?"
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "Yes!"
Fang Jin shook his head and smiled. "Don't you think it's ridiculous for you to say that?"
Ye Xuan blinked his eyes. "Is it ridiculous?"
Fang Jin laughed. "It's not just ridiculous!
As far as I know, there are only two people who can disqualify someone from the academy. One of them is Vice-Dean Bai Dizi, and the other is Ye Xuan. You … "
At this point, he seemed to have thought of something. His pupils suddenly shrank and he took a few steps back. "You …"
Ye Xuan smiled. "What about me?"
Fang Jin stared at Ye Xuan. After a while, he said in a trembling voice, "Ye … Dean …"
Dean Ye!
As soon as he said this, the crowd was in an uproar!
At this time, someone exclaimed, "He … He's City Lord Ye!
It's really him … He used to kill a fish seller here … "
Green City, Ye Family, Ancestral Hall.
"Ancestors, Ye Xuan has no talent and no virtue … From now on, Ye Xuan's position as the Crown Prince will be replaced by Ye Lang."
The person who spoke was an old man in a black robe.
Not far behind the old man stood a young man. The young man had a faint smile on his face.
This person was Ye Lang.
Beside him were the elders of the Ye Family.
"Why!"
At this moment, a timid voice suddenly rang out in the ancestral hall.
Everyone turned to look and saw a little girl standing at the door. She was about 12 or 13 years old, and her hands were tightly gripping the hem of her skirt. Her face had a sickly pallor, and she looked a little weak. There was even a trace of fear in her eyes.
The little girl was called Ye Ling. She was Ye Xuan's younger sister. When she heard that the family wanted to disqualify Ye Xuan, she rushed over despite her illness.
The old man frowned. "Ye Ling, what are you doing!"
The little girl called Ye Ling bowed to the people in the ancestral hall and said timidly, "Great Elder, my brother Ye Xuan is the Crown Prince. Why did you disqualify him?"
The Great Elder looked at Ye Ling coldly. "This is a family matter. Why are you interrupting?
Leave! "
Ye Ling was clearly a little fearful. She did not dare to look the Great Elder in the eye, but she did not leave. Instead, she mustered up her courage and walked into the ancestral hall. She bowed to the elders on both sides of the hall and said, "Elders, my brother is currently fighting with the Li family for the mining rights of the mine in Nanshan. He is now fighting for the family, and it is unknown whether he is alive or dead. However, the family has used a groundless excuse to remove his position as the Crown Prince.
"Impudent!"
The Great Elder suddenly raged. "It's not up to a little girl like you to decide whether to disqualify him or not.
Men, drag her away. "
At this time, the new Crown Prince, Ye Lang, suddenly laughed, "You should be flogged 30 times as a warning!"
The Great Elder replied coldly, "Then flog him 30 times!"
Very quickly, two guards of the Ye Family rushed in.
Ye Ling clenched her fists and said angrily, "This is unfair. My brother has risked his life for the family for so many years. Even now, he is fighting for the family. The family is unfair to him …"
One of the guards glanced at the new Crown Prince, Ye Lang. He knew that this was his chance to shine.
The guard smiled coldly. "Young Master Ye Lang inherits the title of Crown Prince. What are you yelling about?" As he spoke, he raised his hand and slapped Ye Ling's face.
Slap!
A crisp slap sounded. Ye Ling's right cheek instantly turned red and swollen. However, she did not cry. She just covered her cheek tightly.
Ye Lang looked at the guard and smiled. "What's your name?"
The guard quickly bowed. "Subordinate Zhang Mu greets the Crown Prince."
Ye Lang nodded. "You're not bad. After I become the Crown Prince, I will need ten guards. You can be my guard from now on."
Hearing this, Zhang Mu was overjoyed. He quickly bowed deeply. "I will go through fire and water for the Crown Prince. I will do anything for you!"
Ye Lang nodded. "Drag him away. This person is disturbing the ancestral hall. Don't hold back. Understood?"
Zhang Mu glanced at Ye Lang. When he saw the murderous intent in Ye Lang's eyes, he understood.
He immediately grabbed Ye Ling's hair and dragged her out.
At this moment, Zhang Mu suddenly stopped as if he had seen something.
In the ancestral hall, everyone turned their heads to look outside.
Not far from the ancestral hall, a young man was walking towards the ancestral hall. The young man wore a tight-fitting robe. The robe was tattered and covered in blood.
The young man was Ye Xuan, who had rushed back from Nanshan!
Seeing Ye Xuan, Ye Lang's mouth curled into a cold smile.
In the ancestral hall, the Elders frowned.
The Great Elder narrowed his eyes. His face was dark and gloomy. No one knew what he was thinking.
From afar, when Ye Xuan saw Zhang Mu dragging Ye Ling, his face turned savage. "Who gave you the guts to touch my sister?"
When Zhang Mu saw Ye Xuan, his face changed. He looked at Ye Lang and was about to speak. At this time, Ye Xuan leaped in front of him like a ferocious tiger. Before the latter could react, Ye Xuan's fist landed on his face.
Peng!
Zhang Mu felt dizzy, and he stumbled and fell.
Ye Lang did not stop there. He charged at Zhang Mu again. At this time, Ye Lang suddenly roared, "Ye Xuan, he's my man. How dare you …"
Ye Xuan suddenly stepped on Zhang Mu's chest.
Pu!
Zhang Mu spat out a mouthful of blood.
Seeing this, Ye Lang's face turned ugly. Ye Xuan lifted his head to look at him, asking savagely, "Your man?"
As he spoke, he stomped on Zhang Mu's face.
Zhang Mu's face turned into a bloody mess, as he screamed, "Prince, save, save me …"
Ye Xuan ignored Zhang Mu, walking up to Ye Ling. Seeing Ye Ling's state, Ye Xuan felt as though his heart was being sliced apart. He clenched his fists, and his entire body trembled.
When Ye Ling saw Ye Xuan, her tears flowed, "Brother, it hurts, it hurts …"
Hearing this, Ye Xuan's expression turned savage. In the next instant, he charged in front of Zhang Mu and kicked Zhang Mu's head.
Peng!
Qingcheng, Ye Clan, Ancestral Hall.
"Ancestors, Ye Xuan has no talent, no virtue … From now on, Ye Xuan's position as Prince shall be replaced by Ye Lang."
The one who spoke was an old man in black robes.
Not far behind the old man, there was a youth with a faint smile on his face.
This person was Ye Lang.
On both sides, there were the Ye Clan Elders.
"Why!?"
At this time, a timid voice rang out in the Ancestral Hall.
Everyone turned to look and saw a little girl standing at the door. She was about 12 or 13 years old, and her hands were tightly gripping the hem of her skirt. Her face had a sickly pallor, and she looked a little weak. There was even a trace of fear in her eyes.
This girl was called Ye Ling, and she was Ye Xuan's younger sister. When she heard that the clan wanted to remove Ye Xuan, she disregarded her illness and rushed over.
The black-robed old man frowned, "Ye Ling, what are you doing!?"
The little girl called Ye Ling bowed to everyone in the Ancestral Hall, and asked timidly, "Great Elder, my brother, Ye Xuan, is the Prince. Why did you cripple him for no reason?"
The Great Elder looked at Ye Ling coldly, "This is a matter of the clan, what are you interrupting for?
Leave! "
Ye Ling was clearly a little fearful. She did not dare to look the Great Elder in the eye, but she did not leave. Instead, she mustered up her courage and walked into the ancestral hall. She bowed to the elders on both sides of the hall and said, "Elders, my brother is currently fighting with the Li family for the mining rights of the mine in Nanshan. He is now fighting for the family, and it is unknown whether he is alive or dead. However, the family has used a groundless excuse to remove his position as the Crown Prince.
"Impudent!"
The Great Elder suddenly raged, "Whether he's crippled or not, it's not up to a little girl like you to decide.
Men, drag her away! "
At this time, the new Prince, Ye Lang, suddenly laughed, "He should be flogged 30 times, as a warning to others!"
The Great Elder replied coldly, "Then flog him 30 times!"
Very quickly, two Ye Clan guards rushed in.
Ye Ling clenched her fists, and said angrily, "This is unfair! My brother has risked his life for the clan for so many years, and even now, he's fighting for the clan. The clan is unfair to him …"
One of the guards glanced at the new Prince, Ye Lang. He knew that this was his chance to shine.
The guard sneered, "Young Master Ye Lang inherits the Prince's position. What are you yelling about?" As he spoke, he raised his hand and slapped Ye Ling's face.
Slap!
A crisp slap sounded, and the right side of Ye Ling's face instantly swelled up. However, she did not cry, and only held her cheek tightly.
Ye Lang looked at the guard, and smiled, "What's your name?"
The guard quickly bowed, "This subordinate, Zhang Mu, greets the Prince."
Ye Lang nodded, "You're not bad. After I become the Prince, I'll need ten guards. From now on, you'll be my guard."
Hearing this, Zhang Mu was overjoyed, and quickly bowed deeply, "This subordinate is willing to go through fire and water for the Prince, even if it means death!"
Ye Lang nodded, "Drag him away. This person is causing trouble in the ancestral hall. Don't hold back, understand?"
Zhang Mu glanced at Ye Lang, and when he saw the murderous intent in Ye Lang's eyes, he understood.
He immediately grabbed Ye Ling's hair and dragged her out.
At this moment, Zhang Mu seemed to have seen something, and he suddenly stopped.
Inside the ancestral hall, everyone turned their heads to look outside the hall.
Not far from the ancestral hall, a young man was walking towards the ancestral hall. The young man was wearing a tight-fitting robe, and his robe was tattered, and there was blood everywhere.
The young man was Ye Xuan, who had rushed back from Nanshan!
Seeing Ye Xuan, Ye Lang's mouth curled into a cold smile.
In the ancestral hall, the Elders frowned.
The Great Elder narrowed his eyes, and his face was dark. No one knew what he was thinking.
From afar, when Ye Xuan saw Zhang Mu dragging Ye Ling, his face turned savage, "Who gave you the guts to touch my sister?"
When Zhang Mu saw Ye Xuan, his face changed. He quickly looked at Ye Lang, and was about to speak. At this moment, Ye Xuan leaped in front of him like a ferocious tiger. Before the latter could react, Ye Xuan's fist landed on his face.
Bang!
Zhang Mu's head spun, and he stumbled and fell.
Ye Lang did not stop there, and charged towards Zhang Mu again. At this time, Ye Lang suddenly roared, "Ye Xuan, he's my man, how dare you …"
Ye Xuan suddenly stepped on Zhang Mu's chest.
Pu!
Zhang Mu spat out a mouthful of blood.
Seeing this, Ye Lang's face turned ugly, while Ye Xuan lifted his head to look at him, asking savagely, "Your man?"
As he spoke, he stomped on Zhang Mu's face.
Zhang Mu's face turned into a bloody mess, as he screamed, "Prince, save, save me …"
Ye Xuan did not care about Zhang Mu, as he walked to Ye Ling's side. Seeing Ye Ling's state, Ye Xuan felt as though his heart was being sliced by a knife. He clenched his fists, and his entire body trembled.
When Ye Ling saw Ye Xuan, her tears flowed, "Brother, it hurts, it hurts …"
Hearing this, Ye Xuan's expression turned savage. In the next instant, he charged in front of Zhang Mu, and kicked Zhang Mu's head.
Peng!







Chapter 1482
Kill him!
There was complete silence.
Around them, some people secretly shook their heads.
Was there something wrong with Nanmu Chuan's brain?
Facing Ye Xuan, not only did he refuse to admit defeat, he even said such ruthless words. Did he really think that Ye Xuan was a good-tempered person?
Overturn the Fifth Dimension Academy?
How stupid would he have to be to say such words!
Ye Xuan shook his head. He turned to look at A Mu and smiled. "Let's go!"
A Mu nodded.
The two of them left.
On the way, A Mu said softly, "It's our fault. When we go back, I will strengthen the management of the various academies, especially the education on how to behave."
Ye Xuan shook his head. "It's my problem!"
A Mu looked at Ye Xuan. Ye Xuan smiled. "I seemed too easy to talk to at the beginning!
He felt that I was weak.
This world is like this. Some people have a good temper, but in the eyes of others, a good temper means that they are easy to bully. However, a good temper does not mean that they have no temper. "
As he said that, he shook his head. "There are many people!
They like to bully the weak and fear the strong. They like to bully the kind and honest because the kind and honest are easy to bully.
There are also some people who like to use moral coercion. Just look at Nanmu Chuan. He actually said that I am the headmaster and cannot kill him. Killing him would be breaking the law … It really amused me!
This is like a mother of a naughty child. Her child has made a mistake.
However, she does not educate her child. Instead, she educates you and questions you. He is still a child!
How can you be so calculative with a child? "
A Mu shook her head and smiled. "Your analogy …"
Ye Xuan smiled. "It's not particularly appropriate!
But you should understand what I mean! "
A Mu nodded. She seemed to have thought of something. She hesitated and then said, "But you are the headmaster. This matter should not be handled personally. I am afraid that someone will use it …"
Ye Xuan suddenly smiled. "Who dares?"
A Mu was silent.
In the Fifth Dimension, no one dared to stab Ye Xuan in the back.
Ye Xuan suddenly said, "A Mu, what do you think they came to the headquarters for?"
A Mu said, "Learn!"
Ye Xuan asked, "What else?"
A Mu was silent.
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "They are not only here to learn, but also to protect the Five-Dimensional Universe.
The Fifth Dimension. Was it Sister Nian's Fifth Dimension?
Is this my, Ye Xuan's, Five-Dimensional Universe?
No, the Fifth Dimension is everyone's Fifth Dimension. Anyone who lives in the Fifth Dimension has the obligation to protect our Fifth Dimension.
The Academy is not a safe place for them to enjoy. I, Ye Xuan, will not spend money to feed a bunch of conceited people. "
As he spoke, he looked at A Mu. "Remember, we're not doing charity.
For some people, if you help them once, they will shed tears of gratitude. But if you help them ten times, they will feel that it's only right. And if you don't help them anymore!
They might even see you as an enemy.
I'm telling you this because I realized that our Academy lacks a core purpose.
What is the purpose of entering the school?
There's nothing wrong with learning!
But what else?
I don't ask them to serve me, Ye Xuan, but they must serve this universe. Do you understand? "
A Mu nodded. "I understand!"
Ye Xuan nodded. "You can talk to Bai Dizi about this. He will handle it."
Ah Mu smiled and said, "Old Bai is very busy. Let me handle this matter!
I will come up with a plan first, then I will submit it to you. You can make the final decision! "
Ye Xuan nodded. "Okay!"
A Mu smiled. "Come back for noodles next time!"
Ye Xuan laughed. "Okay!"
After chatting for a while, they parted ways. Ye Xuan did not return to the Sword Hall directly. Instead, he went to the Boundless Dungeon.
Tendo Pawnshop!
When Ye Xuan came to the Tendo Pawnshop, the door was open.
There was a woman standing behind the counter inside the door!
It was Xiao Dao!
As if sensing something, Xiao Dao suddenly looked up. When she saw Ye Xuan, she was slightly stunned.
Ye Xuan walked into the pawnshop and smiled. "They told me that you've been living here?"
Xiao Dao nodded. "Yes."
Ye Xuan looked around and said softly, "I haven't been here for a long time!"
Xiao Dao looked at Ye Xuan. "You're very busy now!"
Ye Xuan smiled. "I'm a little busy!"
Xiao Dao said softly, "When will Nian Nian regain her memory?"
Ye Xuan shook his head. "I don't know!"
Xiao Dao was silent.
Ye Xuan was about to speak. At this moment, the space in front of him trembled slightly. Ye Xuan frowned.
Xiao Dao asked, "What's wrong?"
Ye Xuan said in a deep voice, "Nian Nian is gone!"
Gone!
The Little Daoist was stunned for a moment before saying, "It disappeared?"
Ye Xuan nodded. "I'm going back!"
After saying that, he disappeared.
In the pawnshop, Xiao Dao was silent for a while before disappearing.
...
Sword Hall.
When Ye Xuan returned to the Sword Hall, Bai Dizi had been waiting there for a long time.
Ye Xuan said in a deep voice, "You said that Nian Nian is gone?"
Bai Dizi nodded. "Not long ago, she was wandering around the city, so I didn't pay much attention. But not long after, she disappeared!"
Ye Xuan was silent.
Bai Dizi said in a deep voice, "Has she regained her memory?"
Ye Xuan shook his head. "I don't know!"
Bai Dizi was silent.
Ye Xuan said softly, "Have you sent anyone to look for her?"
Bai Dizi nodded. "But there's no news at all. Also, we don't know how she disappeared!"
Ye Xuan was silent for a moment, then said softly, "There's no need to look for her!"
Bai Dizi looked at Ye Xuan. Ye Xuan smiled. "I believe that she will come back!"
With that, he looked at Bai Dizi. "As long as Sister Nian doesn't want anything to happen to her, she won't be in danger!"
Bai Dizi smiled. "That's true!"
Then, he looked at Ye Xuan. "Today is the first day of school. As the dean, you should go."
Ye Xuan shook his head. "I don't really want to go!"
Bai Dizi said, "Is it because of Nanmu Chuan?"
Ye Xuan smiled. "You know about it too?"
Bai Dizi said, "As the most outstanding Swordsman of the younger generation in the South, it's normal for him to be arrogant."
Ye Xuan smiled. "Do you think I did something wrong?"
Bai Dizi shook his head. "No!
Through this matter, I discovered a problem. Many people in the Fifth Dimension respect you, but they don't fear you. If I were the one who appeared, that guy definitely wouldn't have threatened you. On the contrary, he would have immediately admitted his mistake and begged for mercy! "
Ye Xuan smiled. "What's the problem?"
Bai Dizi looked at Ye Xuan. "The reason is that you're too young!
Youngsters generally don't respect other youngsters!
The students in the Academy know you're strong, but no one knows how strong you are!
Therefore, many people don't fear you. Since they don't fear you, they naturally dare to provoke you. After all, they're proud sons of heaven, and these kinds of people usually don't submit to people of the same age!
Therefore, it is necessary for you to attend the Start-of-Term Ceremony.
At the same time, I also hope that you can tell them that in this world, there are youngsters who are more outstanding than them. Let them know that there's always someone better than you! "
Ye Xuan said with a smile, "Looks like I have to go!"
Bai Dizi nodded. "As the dean, you should go no matter what!
Moreover, you should also show your strength.
Let those guys know that you, the dean, aren't some kind of trash! "
Ye Xuan laughed. "Then let's go!"
Bai Dizi nodded and the two of them left.
With regards to Nian Nian, Ye Xuan wasn't really worried because he knew how terrifying Nian Nian was.
...
Fifth Dimensions Academy.
Dao City was unusually lively today because today was the day students from all over the universe would come to Dao City to enroll.
It was also the first time the Dao City's headquarters was recruiting students!
And this time, those who came could be said to be monsters among monsters, geniuses among geniuses.
It could be said that this time, all the monsters and geniuses of the Fifth Dimension would be gathered here, including some geniuses from ancient powers. For example, Nanyue Xiu and Nanyue Qi of the Nanyue Clan. Not only the Nanyue Clan, but there were also geniuses from the Gu Clan and Xuan City.
Fifth Dimensions Academy.
The Fifth Dimensions Academy was built on a large scale. There were more than sixty different learning halls. In addition, there were also formations arranged by the Xuanji Sect. There were all kinds of formations, more than a hundred of them.
As for the lineup of teachers, it was also very luxurious. Aro, An Lanxiu, and Li Shanshui of the Whirling Sect were all teachers of the academy. They were all super experts at the peak of the Fifth Dimension.
At the entrance of the academy, there were two huge statues.
One was of Nian Nian, and the other was of Ye Xuan.
Nian Nian was the Tendo of the Fifth Dimension, the soul of the entire Fifth Dimension, while Ye Xuan was the protector of the entire Fifth Dimension.
As the entrance of the Fifth Dimensions Academy opened, students entered the academy one after another.
Somewhere in the darkness, Bai Dizi smiled and said, "Dao Master, what do you think of these students?"
Ye Xuan looked at the students in the distance and said softly, "Very outstanding!"
Bai Dizi nodded, "This world doesn't lack monsters and geniuses. What it lacks is people who discover them!
This time, even I was shocked by the establishment of the academy!
It turns out that there are so many monsters and geniuses in our cosmos!
Originally, the academy only accepted thirty people every year, but I felt that it wasn't enough, so I expanded it to forty. "
Ye Xuan said softly, "These people are the future of the Fifth Dimension!"
Bai Dizi nodded.
The Fifth Dimension couldn't always be carried by Ye Xuan. His intuition told him that in the future, Ye Xuan would definitely go to a broader stage!
At this time, Ye Xuan suddenly said, "We need to let these guys have a sense of belonging to the Fifth Dimension."
Bai Dizi said with a smile, "That's natural!
Actually, everyone already has a sense of belonging to the Fifth Dimension. Let's not talk about other things, many people in my Dao Sect have already regarded themselves as members of the Fifth Dimension! "
Ye Xuan said with a smile, "That's a good thing!"
Bai Dizi looked at the students in the distance and said with a smile, "Some of the branch vice-deans told me to pay attention."
Pay attention to what? "Ye Xuan was curious.
Bai Dizi said with a smile, "There are many thorns in this batch of students!"
At this time, a man suddenly rushed in from the distance. He was tall and sturdy, and with every step he took, the ground would tremble violently. Not only the ground, but the space he ran through would also tremble.
Ye Xuan looked at this man, and there was some surprise in his eyes. "Not bad!"
Bai Dizi nodded. "This guy is called Man Zi. He is a body cultivator, and he is the strongest among the body cultivators. Moreover, his overall score has reached ten stars."
Ye Xuan was a little curious. "What's the highest score?"
Bai Dizi said, "Twelve stars. This time, among all the students, only one person has reached twelve stars, and among them, there are only six 11-star students."
Ye Xuan was about to speak, but at this time, Man Zi suddenly rushed in front of Ye Xuan's statue. He looked straight at Ye Xuan's statue and roared, "Man Zi of the Great Wilderness, I challenge Dean Ye!
I seek a hammer! "
Ye Xuan was speechless.
..







Chapter 1483
Begging for a hammer!
Ye Xuan's expression was a little strange.
Next to Ye Xuan, Bai Dizi smiled and said, "Look, they are not very convinced by you. However, you have to understand. After all, they are all geniuses. It is normal for them to have drive."
Ye Xuan nodded, "Of course!"
Bai Dizi looked at Man Zi in the distance, "Everyone is waiting for you to appear!"
Ye Xuan laughed, and the next moment, he appeared directly in front of Man Zi.
Seeing Ye Xuan, there was an uproar in the field.
Ye Xuan appeared!
The eyes of all the students around fell on Ye Xuan. There was respect, curiosity, excitement, and provocation …
Dean!
Although Ye Xuan was the Dean, Ye Xuan was the same age as them. In addition, Ye Xuan's strength was mostly legendary. For example, Ye Xuan had killed a Consolidation Realm expert and so on … Therefore, many people had always been skeptical about Ye Xuan's strength.
In other words, many people wanted to know how strong Ye Xuan was!
Seeing Ye Xuan, the barbarian chuckled. "You're the dean?"
Ye Xuan nodded, "Yes!"
Man Zi glanced at Ye Xuan, "Do you dare to accept my challenge?"
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "I dare!"
Man Zi grinned and said, "Let me tell you, my fist has no eyes. If I hurt you later, don't blame me, and don't make things difficult for me!"
Ye Xuan was directly amused by this guy!
It turned out that this guy was afraid that he would make things difficult for him!
Man Zi asked again, "Is there a problem?"
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "Don't worry, I will definitely not make things difficult for you."
Man Zi grinned, "Then I won't be polite!"
As his voice fell, he suddenly rushed forward. With this rush, the space in front of Ye Xuan directly turned into a groove!
His physical strength was too strong!
When he arrived in front of Ye Xuan, the barbarian directly threw a punch at Ye Xuan's head.
It was a simple punch!
However, this punch contained a powerful and overbearing force!
With a single punch, the space around Ye Xuan directly cracked!
Needless to say, Ye Xuan was still a little shocked. This punch was definitely not something an average Dao Accomplished Realm powerhouse could resist!
And how old was this barbarian?
To have such great power at such a young age, one had to say that it was very terrifying!
Without any hesitation, Ye Xuan punched out.
Boom!
Under everyone's gazes, the barbarian was sent flying out of the academy before crashing heavily onto the ground.
Bang!
The ground collapsed, and the barbarian's body trembled.
The surroundings fell silent!
One punch!
Many of the students present turned solemn.
Right at this moment, the barbarian slowly crawled up from the ground, and his entire body had cracked apart!
Ye Xuan walked over to him, and the barbarian hurriedly said, "No! No more!
I can't! "
Ye Xuan smiled, "I'm not going to hit you!"
As he spoke, he withdrew a medicinal pill and passed it to Man 'zi. "It's for healing!"
Man 'zi glanced at Ye Xuan, hesitated for a moment, and then took the medicinal pill and consumed it. As soon as the medicinal pill entered his body, a strand of pure energy swept out from within him, and it didn't take long for his injuries to heal at a visible speed.
Man 'zi was slightly shocked. "This …."
Ye Xuan smiled, "Your physical body isn't bad, and your strength isn't bad as well. However, there's still a lot of room for growth!"
Man 'zi hurriedly stood up and bowed respectfully.
Pine City, the Ye Clan's Ancestral Shrine.
"Ancestors, Ye Xuan is lacking in talent and virtue …. From this moment onward, Ye Xuan is removed from the position of Heir and will be succeeded by Ye Lang."
The one who spoke was an old man in a black robe.
Not far behind the old man stood a youth with a faint smile hanging on the corners of his mouth.
This person was Ye Lang.
And on both sides were the Ye Clan's Elders.
"Why!"
At this moment, a somewhat timid voice suddenly resounded in the Ancestral Shrine.
Everyone turned to look and saw a little girl standing at the door. She was about 12 or 13 years old, and her hands were tightly gripping the hem of her skirt. Her face had a sickly pallor, and she looked a little weak. There was even a trace of fear in her eyes.
The little girl was called Ye Ling, and she was Ye Xuan's younger sister. When she heard that the Clan wanted to remove Ye Xuan, she disregarded her illness and rushed over.
The black-robed old man frowned, "Ye Ling, what are you doing!"
The little girl called Ye Ling bowed to the people in the Ancestral Shrine, and said timidly, "Great Elder, my brother Ye Xuan is a Heir, why did you remove him for no reason?"
The Great Elder looked at Ye Ling coldly, "This is a Clan matter, why are you interrupting?
Leave! "
Ye Ling was obviously afraid, and did not dare to look directly at the Great Elder, but she did not leave. Instead, she summoned her courage and walked into the Ancestral Shrine. She bowed again to the Elders on both sides, "Dear Elders, my brother is fighting with the Li Clan over the mining rights at Nanshan. He is fighting for the Clan, and his life is uncertain. But the Clan is using a groundless excuse to remove him from the position of Heir. This is really unfair."
"Impudent!"
The Great Elder suddenly said angrily, "Whether he is removed or not, it is not up to a little girl like you to decide.
Men, drag her away for me. "
At this time, the new Heir Ye Lang suddenly laughed, "You should be flogged thirty times as a warning to others!"
The Great Elder coldly said, "Then flog thirty times!"
Soon, two guards of the Ye Clan rushed in.
Ye Ling clenched her fists, and said angrily, "This is unfair. My brother has risked his life for the Clan for so many years, and even now he is fighting for the Clan. The Clan is so unfair to him …"
One of the guards glanced at the new Heir Ye Lang, and he knew that his chance to shine had come.
The guard smiled coldly, "Young Master Ye Lang inherits the position of Heir, and it is everyone's wish. What are you yelling about?" As he spoke, he raised his hand and slapped Ye Ling's face.
Slap!
A crisp slap sounded, and the right side of Ye Ling's face instantly swelled up. But she did not cry, and only held her cheek tightly.
Ye Lang looked at the guard, and smiled, "What's your name?"
The guard hurriedly bowed, "Subordinate Zhang Mu greets the Heir."
Ye Lang nodded, "You're not bad. After I become the Heir, I will need ten guards. You will be my guard from now on."
Hearing this, Zhang Mu was overjoyed, and quickly bowed deeply, "This subordinate will go through fire and water for the Heir, and I will risk my life for him!"
Ye Lang nodded, "Drag him out. This person is disturbing the ancestral hall, don't show mercy, understand?"
Zhang Mu glanced at Ye Lang, and when he saw the murderous intent in Ye Lang's eyes, he understood.
He immediately grabbed Ye Ling's hair and dragged her out.
At this moment, Zhang Mu seemed to see something, and suddenly stopped.
In the ancestral hall, everyone turned their heads to look outside.
Not far from the ancestral hall, a young man was walking towards the ancestral hall. The young man was wearing a tight-fitting robe, and the robe was tattered, and there was blood everywhere.
The young man was Ye Xuan, who had rushed back from Nanshan!
Seeing Ye Xuan, Ye Lang's lips curled into a sinister smile.
Inside the ancestral hall, the Elders frowned.
The Great Elder narrowed his eyes, and his expression was frighteningly gloomy. No one knew what he was thinking.
From afar, when Ye Xuan saw Zhang Mu dragging Ye Ling, his expression turned savage, "Who gave you the guts to touch my sister?"
When Zhang Mu saw Ye Xuan, his expression changed. He quickly looked at Ye Lang, and was about to speak, when Ye Xuan suddenly leaped in front of him like a ferocious tiger. Before the latter could react, Ye Xuan's fist landed on his face.
Peng!
Zhang Mu felt a wave of dizziness, and he stumbled and fell.
However, Ye Ling did not stop there. He charged towards Zhang Mu again. At this time, Ye Lang suddenly roared, "Ye Xuan, he's my man, how dare you …"
Ye Xuan suddenly stepped on Zhang Mu's chest.
Pu!
Zhang Mu spat out a mouthful of blood.
Seeing this, Ye Lang's expression turned ugly. Ye Xuan looked up at him, and snarled, "Your man?"
As he spoke, he stepped on Zhang Mu's face.
Zhang Mu's face turned into a bloody mess, as he screamed, "Prince, save, save me …"
Ye Xuan did not care about Zhang Mu, as he walked to Ye Ling's side. Seeing Ye Ling's appearance, Ye Xuan felt as though his heart was being sliced by a knife. He clenched his fists, and his entire body trembled.
When Ye Ling saw Ye Xuan, her tears flowed out, "Brother, it hurts, it hurts …"
Hearing this, Ye Xuan's expression turned savage. In the next instant, he charged in front of Zhang Mu, and kicked Zhang Mu's head.
Peng!
Qingcheng, Ye Clan, Ancestral Hall.
"Ancestors, Ye Xuan has no talent, no virtue … From now on, Ye Xuan's position as Prince shall be replaced by Ye Lang."
The one who spoke was an old man in black robes.
Not far behind the old man, there was a youth with a faint smile on his face.
This person was Ye Lang.
On both sides, there were the Ye Clan Elders.
"Why!?"
At this time, a timid voice rang out in the ancestral hall.
Everyone turned to look and saw a little girl standing at the door. She was about 12 or 13 years old, and her hands were tightly gripping the hem of her skirt. Her face had a sickly pallor, and she looked a little weak. There was even a trace of fear in her eyes.
This girl was called Ye Ling, and she was Ye Xuan's younger sister. When she heard that the clan wanted to remove Ye Xuan, she disregarded her illness and rushed over.
The black-robed old man frowned, "Ye Ling, what are you doing!?"
The little girl called Ye Ling bowed to the people in the ancestral hall, and said timidly, "Great Elder, my brother Ye Xuan is a Prince, why did you discard him for no reason?"
The Great Elder looked at Ye Ling coldly, "This is a matter of the clan, why are you interrupting?
Leave! "
Ye Ling was obviously afraid, not daring to look at the Great Elder, but she did not leave. Instead, she plucked up her courage and walked into the ancestral hall. She bowed to the Elders on both sides, "Elders, my brother is fighting with the Li Clan over the mining rights at Nanshan. He is fighting for the clan, and we don't know if he's dead or alive. Yet, the clan is using a groundless excuse to discard his position. This is unfair."
"Impudent!"
The Great Elder suddenly raged, "Whether he discards his position or not, it's not up to a little girl like you to decide.
Men, drag her away. "
At this time, the new Prince, Ye Lang, suddenly laughed, "You should be flogged 30 times as a warning to others!"
The Great Elder replied coldly, "Then flog her 30 times!"
Soon, two guards of the Ye Clan rushed in.
Ye Ling clenched her fists and said angrily, "This is unfair. My brother has risked his life for the clan for so many years. Even now, he is risking his life for the clan. The clan is so unfair to him …"
One of the guards glanced at the new Prince, Ye Lang. He knew that this was his chance to shine.
The guard sneered, "Young Master Ye Lang inherits the position of Prince. What are you yelling about?" As he spoke, he raised his hand and slapped Ye Ling's face.
Slap!
A crisp slap sounded, and the right side of Ye Ling's face instantly swelled up. However, she did not cry. She only covered her cheek tightly.
Ye Lang looked at the guard and smiled, "What's your name?"
The guard hurriedly bowed. "Subordinate Zhang Mu greets the Crown Prince."
Ye Lang nodded, "You're not bad. After I become the Prince, I will need 10 guards. You can be my guard from now on."
Hearing this, Zhang Mu was overjoyed. He quickly bowed deeply, "This subordinate is willing to go through fire and water for the Prince!"
Ye Lang nodded, "Drag him away. This person is disturbing the ancestral hall. Don't hold back. Do you understand?"
Zhang Mu glanced at Ye Lang. When he saw the murderous intent in Ye Lang's eyes, he understood.
He immediately grabbed Ye Ling's hair and dragged her out.
At this moment, Zhang Mu suddenly stopped as if he had seen something.
Inside the ancestral hall, everyone turned their heads to look outside the hall.
Not far from the ancestral hall, a young man was walking towards the ancestral hall. The young man was wearing a tight-fitting robe. The robe was tattered and covered in blood.
The young man was Ye Xuan, who had rushed back from Nanshan!
Seeing Ye Xuan, Ye Lang's lips curled into a sinister smile.
Inside the ancestral hall, the Elders frowned.
The Great Elder narrowed his eyes, his face dark and gloomy. No one knew what he was thinking.
From afar, when Ye Xuan saw Zhang Mu dragging Ye Ling, his face turned savage. "Who gave you the guts to touch my sister?"
When Zhang Mu saw Ye Xuan, his face changed. He quickly looked at Ye Lang and was about to speak. At this time, Ye Xuan leaped in front of him like a ferocious tiger. Before the latter could react, Ye Xuan's fist landed on his face.
Peng!
Zhang Mu felt a wave of dizziness, and he stumbled and fell.
However, Ye Ling did not stop there. He charged at Zhang Mu again. At this time, Ye Lang suddenly roared, "Ye Xuan, he's my man! How dare you …"
Ye Xuan suddenly stepped on Zhang Mu's chest.
Pu!
Zhang Mu spat out a mouthful of blood.
Seeing this, Ye Lang's face turned ugly. Ye Xuan looked up at him and said, "Your man?"
As he spoke, he stepped on Zhang Mu's face.
Zhang Mu's face turned into a bloody mess, as he screamed, "Prince, save, save me …"
Ye Xuan did not care about Zhang Mu, as he walked up to Ye Ling. Seeing Ye Ling's state, Ye Xuan felt as though his heart was being sliced apart. He clenched his fists, and his entire body trembled.

Hearing this, Ye Xuan's expression turned savage. In the next instant, he charged in front of Zhang Mu and kicked Zhang Mu's head.
Peng!







Chapter 1484
Who was that mysterious person just now?
Ye Xuan was puzzled.
As if he thought of something, Ye Xuan got up and left. After a while, he arrived at the Dao Gate.
He was looking for Third Miss!
Dao Gate.
As soon as Ye Xuan arrived, an old man appeared in front of him. The old man glanced at Ye Xuan and cupped his fists. "Young Master Ye!"
Ye Xuan smiled. "I'm looking for Third Miss. Please inform her!"
The old man smiled bitterly. "Young Master Ye came at a bad time. Third Miss has just left!"
Ye Xuan frowned. "Left?"
The old man nodded.
Ye Xuan asked, "Where did she go?"
The old man shook his head. "She didn't say!"
Ye Xuan fell silent.
The old man said, "Young Master Ye, do you want to go in and have a seat?"
Ye Xuan smiled. "Thank you!
But there's no need!
I still have something to deal with. Goodbye! "
With that said, he turned and left.
After a moment of silence, the old man turned and left. It didn't take long for him to arrive in front of a large hall, within which sat a woman.
It was Third Miss!
The old man bowed slightly. "Third Master, Young Master Ye has left!"
Third Miss nodded slightly. "Got it!"
The old man was puzzled. "Third Master, why didn't you see Young Master Ye?"
Third Miss felt helpless. "Because I'm afraid of death!"
The old man was speechless.
Third Miss got up and walked to the entrance of the hall. She looked up at the sky and said softly, "I'm afraid that Young Master Ye is in big trouble!"
...
After Ye Xuan left the Taoist Gate, his face became more and more serious.
His intuition told him that Third Miss did not want to see him!
But why did she not want to see him?
It was simple!
His enemy made Third Miss fearful, extremely fearful!
Who was that enemy?
Could it be that aunt?
A moment later, Ye Xuan turned and left.
He arrived at Xuan City.
In a certain hall, Lan Ruo shook his head. "I didn't see them, so I don't know which faction they are from!"
After a moment of silence, Ye Xuan stood up and said with a smile, "Miss Lanruo, I'll take my leave first!"
Lan Ruo looked at Ye Xuan. "Young Master Ye, take care!"
Ye Xuan nodded. "You too."
As soon as he finished speaking, he turned around and transformed into a streak of sword light that vanished into the horizon.
Inside the hall, Lan Ruo looked at the horizon in silence.
Although Ye Xuan no longer had his archenemy, Dao Sect, she realized that Ye Xuan seemed to be in more danger!
There seemed to be an invisible hand secretly targeting Ye Xuan!
As for who it was, she didn't know either. However, she knew that it wasn't an ordinary mastermind!
After a short moment, Lan Ruo sighed softly, turned around, and left.
...
After leaving the Profound City, Ye Xuan came to a starry sky and slowly closed his eyes.
He was sure that he had a hidden enemy, and this enemy was very, very powerful!
The Sacred Land!
Ye Xuan suddenly opened his eyes. At this moment, he thought of the Sacred Land!
Dao Sect was no longer his enemy, so there was only one place left — the Sacred Land, a mysterious force that even Profound City couldn't infiltrate!
As he thought of this, Ye Xuan suddenly transformed into a streak of sword light and disappeared into the horizon.
Not long after, Ye Xuan arrived at the Sacred Land.
As soon as he entered the Sacred Land, the Sacred Leader of the Sacred Land appeared in front of Ye Xuan.
Seeing the Sacred Leader, Ye Xuan's face darkened.
He didn't come openly, he came sneakily. Of course, he didn't come openly.
Green City, Ye Clan, Ancestral Hall.
"Ancestors, Ye Xuan has no talent and no virtue … From this moment onwards, Ye Xuan's position as Crown Prince shall be removed and Ye Lang shall take over."
The one who spoke was an old man dressed in a black robe.
Not far behind the old man stood a young man with a faint smile on his face.
This person was Ye Lang.
On both sides were the Ye Clan's elders.
"Why?!"
At this moment, a timid voice suddenly rang out in the ancestral hall.
Everyone looked over and saw a little girl standing at the door. She was about 12 or 13 years old, and her two little hands were tightly gripping the hem of her skirt. Her face was sickly pale, and she looked a little weak. There was even a trace of timidity in her eyes.
This little girl was called Ye Ling, and she was Ye Xuan's younger sister. When she heard that the clan wanted to remove Ye Xuan, she rushed over despite her illness.
The black-robed old man frowned. "Ye Ling, what are you doing!"
The little girl called Ye Ling bowed slightly to the people in the ancestral hall and said timidly, "Great Elder, my brother, Ye Xuan, is the Crown Prince. Why did you cripple him for no reason?"
The Great Elder looked coldly at Ye Ling. "This is a family matter. Why are you interrupting?
Leave! "
Ye Ling was clearly a little fearful. She did not dare to look the Great Elder in the eye, but she did not leave. Instead, she mustered up her courage and walked into the ancestral hall. She bowed to the elders on both sides of the hall and said, "Elders, my brother is currently fighting with the Li family for the mining rights of the mine in Nanshan. He is now fighting for the family, and it is unknown whether he is alive or dead. However, the family has used a groundless excuse to remove his position as the Crown Prince. This is truly unfair.
"Impudent!"
The Great Elder suddenly raged, "Whether he's stripped or not, it's not up to a little girl like you to decide.
Men, drag her away. "
At this time, the new Crown Prince, Ye Lang, suddenly laughed, "You should be flogged 30 times as a warning to others!"
The Great Elder coldly replied, "Then do it 30 times!"
Very quickly, two Ye Clan's guards rushed in.
Ye Ling clenched her fists, and said angrily, "This is unfair. My brother has risked his life for the clan for so many years. Even now, he's fighting for the clan. The clan is unfair to him …"
One of the guards glanced at the new Crown Prince, Ye Lang. He knew that this was his chance to shine.
The guard sneered, "Young Master Ye Lang inherits the Crown Prince position. What are you yelling about?" As he spoke, he raised his hand and slapped Ye Ling's face.
Slap!
A crisp slap sounded, and the right side of Ye Ling's face instantly turned red and swollen. However, she did not cry, and only held her cheek tightly.
Ye Lang looked at the guard and smiled, "What's your name?"
The guard quickly bowed, "Subordinate Zhang Mu greets the Crown Prince."
Ye Lang nodded, "You're not bad. After I become the Crown Prince, I'll need ten guards. From now on, you'll be my guard."
Hearing this, Zhang Mu was overjoyed, and quickly bowed deeply, "I'll go through fire and water for the Crown Prince, and I'll risk my life for you!"
Ye Lang nodded, "Drag him away. This person is causing trouble in the Ancestral Hall, do not hold back. Understood?"
Zhang Mu glanced at Ye Lang, and when he saw the killing intent in Ye Lang's eyes, he understood.
He immediately grabbed Ye Ling's hair and dragged her out.
At this time, Zhang Mu seemed to have seen something, and he suddenly stopped.
Within the Ancestral Hall, everyone turned their heads to look outside.
Not far from the Ancestral Hall, a young man was walking towards the Ancestral Hall. He was wearing a tight-fitting robe that was tattered and covered in blood.
This person was Ye Xuan, who had rushed back from the Nanshan!
Seeing Ye Xuan, Ye Lang's lips curled into a cold smile.
Inside the Ancestral Hall, all the Elders frowned.
The Great Elder narrowed his eyes, and his face was dark. No one knew what he was thinking.
From afar, when Ye Xuan saw Zhang Mu dragging Ye Ling, his face turned savage, "Who gave you the guts to touch my sister?"
When Zhang Mu saw Ye Xuan, his face changed. He quickly looked at Ye Lang and was about to speak. At this time, Ye Xuan was like a ferocious tiger leaping in front of him. Before the latter could react, Ye Xuan's fist landed on his face.
Peng!
Zhang Mu felt a wave of dizziness, and he stumbled and fell.
Ye Lang did not stop there, and charged towards Zhang Mu again. At this time, Ye Lang suddenly roared, "Ye Xuan, he's my man, how dare you …"
Ye Xuan suddenly stepped on Zhang Mu's chest.
Pu!
Zhang Mu spat out a mouthful of blood.
Seeing this, Ye Lang's face turned ugly, while Ye Xuan lifted his head to look at him, asking savagely, "Your man?"
As he spoke, he stomped down on Zhang Mu's face.
Zhang Mu's face turned into a bloody mess, as he screamed, "Prince, save, save me …"
Ye Xuan did not care about Zhang Mu, as he walked to Ye Ling's side. Seeing Ye Ling's state, Ye Xuan felt as though his heart was being sliced by a knife. He clenched his fists, and his entire body trembled.
When Ye Ling saw Ye Xuan, her tears flowed, "Brother, it hurts, it hurts …"
Hearing this, Ye Xuan's expression turned savage. In the next instant, he charged in front of Zhang Mu and kicked Zhang Mu's head.
Peng!
Qingcheng, Ye Clan, Ancestral Hall.
"Ancestors, Ye Xuan has no talent, no virtue … From now on, Ye Xuan's position as Prince shall be replaced by Ye Lang."
The one who spoke was an old man in black robes.
Not far behind the old man, there was a youth with a faint smile on his face.
This person was Ye Lang.
On both sides, there were the Ye Clan Elders.
"Why!?"
Right at this moment, a slightly timid voice suddenly resounded within the ancestral hall.
Everyone turned to look and saw a little girl standing at the door. She was about 12 or 13 years old, and her hands were tightly gripping the hem of her skirt. Her face had a sickly pallor, and she looked a little weak. There was even a trace of fear in her eyes.
This girl was called Ye Ling, and she was Ye Xuan's younger sister. When she heard that the clan wanted to remove Ye Xuan, she disregarded her illness and rushed over.
The black-robed old man frowned, "Ye Ling, what are you doing!?"
The girl called Ye Ling bowed to everyone in the hall, as she asked timidly, "Great Elder, my brother, Ye Xuan, is the Prince. Why did you cripple him for no reason?"
The Great Elder looked at Ye Ling coldly, "This is a matter of the clan, what are you interrupting for?
Leave! "
Ye Ling was clearly a little fearful. She did not dare to look the Great Elder in the eye, but she did not leave. Instead, she mustered up her courage and walked into the ancestral hall. She bowed to the elders on both sides of the hall and said, "Elders, my brother is currently fighting with the Li family for the mining rights of the mine in Nanshan. He is now fighting for the family, and it is unknown whether he is alive or dead. However, the family has used a groundless excuse to remove his position as the Crown Prince.
"Impudent!"
The Great Elder suddenly raged, "Whether or not he is crippled, it is not up to a little girl like you to decide.
Men, drag her away! "
At this time, the new Prince, Ye Lang, suddenly laughed, "You should be flogged 30 times as a warning to others!"
The Great Elder replied coldly, "Then do it 30 times!"

Slap!
A crisp slap sounded, and the right side of Ye Ling's face instantly turned red and swollen. However, she did not cry, and only held her cheek tightly.
Ye Long sized up the guard and asked with a smile, "What's your name?"
The guard hurriedly bowed, "Subordinate Zhang Mu greets the Prince."
Ye Lang nodded, "You are very good. After I become the Prince, I will need ten guards. From now on, you will be my guard."
Hearing this, Zhang Mu was overjoyed, and hurriedly bowed deeply, "Subordinate will go through fire and water for the Prince, and I will risk my life for you!"
Ye Lang nodded slightly, "Drag him away. This person is disturbing the ancestral hall. Do not show mercy, understood?"
Zhang Mu glanced at Ye Lang, and when he saw the murderous intent in Ye Lang's eyes, he understood.
He immediately grabbed Ye Ling's hair and dragged her out.
At this moment, Zhang Mu seemed to have seen something, and suddenly stopped.
In the ancestral hall, everyone turned their heads to look outside.
Not far from the ancestral hall, a young man was walking towards the ancestral hall. The young man was wearing a tight-fitting robe, and the robe was tattered, and there was blood everywhere.
The young man was Ye Xuan, who had rushed back from Nanshan!
Seeing Ye Xuan, Ye Lang's mouth curled into a cold smile.
In the ancestral hall, the Elders frowned.
The Great Elder narrowed his eyes, and his expression was frighteningly gloomy. No one knew what he was thinking.
From afar, when Ye Xuan saw Zhang Mu dragging Ye Ling, his expression turned savage, "Who gave you the guts to touch my sister?"
When Zhang Mu saw Ye Xuan, his expression changed. He hurriedly looked at Ye Lang, and was about to speak, when Ye Xuan suddenly leaped in front of him like a ferocious tiger. Before the latter could react, Ye Xuan's fist landed on his face.
Peng!
Zhang Mu felt a wave of dizziness, and he stumbled and fell.
Ye Lang did not stop there, and he rushed towards Zhang Mu again. At this time, Ye Lang suddenly roared, "Ye Xuan, he's my man, how dare you …"
Ye Xuan suddenly stepped on Zhang Mu's chest.
Pu!
Zhang Mu spat out a mouthful of blood.
Seeing this, Ye Lang's expression turned ugly, while Ye Xuan lifted his head to look at him, asking savagely, "Your man?"
As he spoke, he stepped on Zhang Mu's face.
Zhang Mu's entire face turned into a bloody mess, as he screamed, "Prince, save, save me …"
Ye Xuan did not care about Zhang Mu, who was crying for help, as he walked to Ye Ling's side. Seeing Ye Ling's state, Ye Xuan felt as though his heart was being sliced by a knife. He clenched his fists, and his entire body trembled.
When Ye Ling saw Ye Xuan, her tears flowed, "Brother, it hurts, it hurts …"
Hearing this, Ye Xuan's expression turned savage. In the next instant, he charged in front of Zhang Mu and kicked Zhang Mu's head.
Peng!







Chapter 1485
He ran away!
The Sacred Lord's expression was somewhat unsightly. He had thought that Ye Xuan would go down and fight!
He did not expect Ye Xuan to turn around and run.
A moment later, the Sacred Lord turned and left. He came to the bamboo house.
The Sacred Lord bowed slightly to the bamboo house. "Master, Ye Xuan's growth is too fast."
Inside the bamboo house, the woman put down the teacup and picked up an ancient book. She opened it and smiled. "There's nothing bad about it!"
Nothing bad about it?
The Sacred Lord was somewhat dumbfounded.
The woman chuckled. "He will become even stronger!"
The Sacred Lord hesitated and said, "Master, aren't you worried?"
The woman turned and looked outside the bamboo house. She smiled. "I told you!
Whether he lives or not doesn't depend on him. Whether I die or not also doesn't depend on him!
At least for the next 30 years! "
The Sacred Lord was silent.
The woman put down the ancient book and walked out of the bamboo house. The Sacred Lord hurriedly bowed.
The woman stretched and smiled. "Miss Nian Nian, I haven't seen her for a long time!
She must have gone to find help!
Who would she call?
Let me think … Miss An has been following him. She probably won't come!
Nether Hall?
They are quite troublesome now. They probably won't come either.
Then who else could it be?
Tu?
Situ Tingyun?
Probably not either!
Both of them have been targeted by the Calamity Cause … Tianxiu?
Probably not. After all, her main body isn't here … Oh, the three-dimensional universe … Princess … should be her!
After all, she's the only one who can fight! "
Saying this, she seemed to have thought of something. The smile on her face gradually disappeared. "Don't tell me she called that Miss Ding?
If that's the case, then it'll be troublesome! "
At the side, the Sacred Lord bowed. He was puzzled. Why didn't he know any of the people his master mentioned?
At this moment, the woman suddenly smiled and said, "I'll go out and see if I can make more enemies for him. I'll also look for the Great Dao Spirit … During this period of time, don't provoke Lord Ye. It won't be long before someone comes to deal with him."
After saying this, she walked into the distance. Soon, she completely disappeared into the horizon.
...
Ye Xuan returned to the Fifth Dimension.
In the hall, Ye Xuan sat on the ground with his legs crossed. At this moment, his expression was extremely solemn.
Back in the sacred ground, when that divine sense locked onto him, he knew that he was no match for the owner of that divine sense!
Who was this person?
There was no answer!
Ye Xuan slowly closed his eyes. At this moment, he felt a little uneasy.
The enemy of the Holy Land was different from the Dao Sect because he could not figure out their intentions.
For the Dao scripture?
However, the Dao Scripture was no longer in his hands, and the Spirit of the Great Dao had already escaped. The other party had no reason to look for him!
But if it wasn't for the Taoist scripture, then what was it for?
Ye Xuan couldn't figure it out!
At this moment, a little girl walked in!
Ye Xuan was stunned when he saw the little girl. The person who had come was none other than Nian Nian.
Nian Nian held a stick of tanghulu in her right hand and a struggling small fish in her left.
Nian Nian walked in front of Ye Xuan and giggled. "Grilled fish!"
Ye Xuan looked at Nian Nian. "Nian Nian, where did you go before this?"
Nian Nian blinked. "I've been playing outside all this time!"
Ye Xuan frowned slightly. "Playing outside?"
Nian Nian nodded. "Yes!"
Ye Xuan fell silent.
Nian Nian didn't seem to be lying.
Nian Nian suddenly asked softly, "What's wrong?"
Ye Xuan retracted his thoughts and shook his head. He smiled and said, "It's nothing. I'll grill fish for you!"
Nian Nian grinned. "Okay!"
...
Somewhere in the starry sky, a woman was walking slowly.
This person was none other than Ye Ling!
Ye Ling looked into the depths of the starry sky in the distance. "We're almost there!"
As soon as she said that, her speed suddenly increased.
Soon, Ye Ling arrived at a small village. This village was a little strange because it was in the starry sky.
Ye Ling walked into the village.
The village was very deserted. The surrounding light was dim, and it looked a little like a ghost village.
At that moment, an old man walked out. When he saw Ye Ling, the old man frowned slightly. "You are?"
Ye Ling opened her palm, and a faint light flickered in her palm.
Seeing this, the old man was slightly taken aback. The next moment, he knelt down and said in a trembling voice, "Clan … Clan Leader …"
Ye Ling nodded. "Did he store my body here?"
The old man hurriedly nodded. "Yes!"
After a long silence, Ye Ling said, "Take me there!"
The old man hurriedly stood up and said in a trembling voice, "Clan Leader, follow me!"
With that, he turned and left.
At that moment, the old man's face was already covered in tears. He was happy.
They had waited for countless years, and the clan leader had finally arrived …
Ye Ling followed the old man.
On the way, Ye Ling suddenly asked, "How many clansmen are left?"
The old man shook his head. "Not many!
If it weren't for Young Master Yang's care back then, I'm afraid … "
Ye Ling was silent.
The Void Spirit Clan had become history!
Soon, the two disappeared into the distance.
...
Ultimate Martial Realm.
Wu Li sat cross-legged on a mountain peak. He formed a seal with his hands and exuded a powerful aura. This aura was getting stronger and stronger, and it was no longer the aura that a Godly State expert should have!
....
Northern Wilderness.
In the deepest part of Northern Wilderness, there was a huge stone tablet that was over a hundred feet tall. The stone tablet stood in a deep pit.
A few hundred feet away, a middle-aged man was walking toward the stone tablet. When he was about a hundred feet away from the stone tablet, he suddenly knelt down, put his palms together, and bowed to the stone tablet. He was even chanting something piously.
After a while, the middle-aged man stood up and continued walking toward the stone tablet. After about ten steps, he knelt down again …
Just like that, the middle-aged man slowly approached the stone tablet, kneeling and bowing every ten steps.
After a long time, the middle-aged man came before the stone tablet. He knelt down in front of the stone tablet, put his palms together, and said in a trembling voice, "Exalted Goddess, Ye Xuan has gone too far. Not only did he absorb the souls of our clansmen, but he also took away all our treasures. Please help us, Exalted Goddess."
The stone tablet did not respond.
The middle-aged man bowed again. Just as he was about to speak, a woman suddenly appeared behind him.
The middle-aged man turned around. When he saw the woman, his expression changed drastically. "You …"
This woman was the mysterious woman who had robbed Northern Wilderness!
The woman smiled. "You don't seem to want to see me!"
The middle-aged man quickly retreated behind the stone tablet. He stared at the mysterious woman. "What are you trying to do!"
The mysterious woman blinked. "He said that he's afraid that you'll take revenge, so he wants me to kill all of you!"
The middle-aged man roared. "You've gone too far!"
The mysterious woman waved her right hand.
Boom!
The middle-aged man was sent flying a few hundred feet away. However, he did not die. It was obvious that the woman had shown mercy.
After sending the middle-aged man flying, the mysterious woman looked at the stone tablet and slammed her fist forward!
The middle-aged man's eyes almost popped out of their sockets at the sight of this. "No!"
The stone tablet was their faith, their supreme faith. It was the most sacred existence of their era.
When the mysterious woman's power blasted against the stone tablet, it shook violently. However, it did not shatter. Moreover, the mysterious woman's powerful force had vanished without a trace.
A trace of surprise flashed through the mysterious woman's eyes. "Not bad!"
At this moment, an extremely powerful aura suddenly appeared from the stone tablet. The mysterious woman blinked and said, "Farewell!"
With that, she turned around and disappeared. As she left, she took away many more treasures …
The middle-aged man was speechless.
The stone tablet gradually trembled. After a long time, an ancient voice sounded out from within it. "You've gone too far!"
The middle-aged man hurriedly nodded. This woman isn't just an ordinary kind of bully. She comes here every few days to bully others!
She's not human!
At this moment, a voice suddenly sounded out from within the stone tablet. "Ge Yao, awaken the clansmen."
With that, a black token suddenly floated out from the stone tablet.
The middle-aged man called Ge Yao instantly became excited at the sight of the black token. He hurriedly caught the black token. "As you command, Exalted God."
With that, he turned around and left.
Before long, countless powerful auras shot into the sky throughout the entire Northern Wilderness … and the seals left behind by the Dao Ancestor were directly destroyed by a mysterious force.
...
Taoism.
The Third Young Lady, who was sitting cross-legged in the main hall, suddenly opened her eyes. After a long time, she slowly closed her eyes. "This crazy woman …"
....
In a small bar in the Divine City, the shopkeeper behind the counter suddenly looked in the direction of the Northern Wilderness. In the next moment, he turned around and came to a small courtyard. He bowed slightly towards the room in front of him. "Master, there's something strange in the Northern Wilderness!"
After a long time, a voice sounded out from the room. "I know!"
The shopkeeper hesitated for a moment and then said, "Do you want me to go investigate?"
In the bar, the voice said, "No need!
This isn't something you can interfere with. "
The shopkeeper bowed slightly and then left.
....
Soon, many powerful auras rushed out of the Northern Desolate Land. These mysterious experts were all above the Immortal Realm. After they left the Northern Desolate Land, they went straight to the Fifth Dimension …
...
Orc World.
In the starry sky, a middle-aged man stood quietly. His hands were behind his back and his eyes were closed.
This person was the Beast King of the Beastmen Tribe!
At this moment, a Beastman suddenly appeared in front of the Beast King. The Beastman bowed slightly to the Beast King, "King, there's a strange movement in the Northern Wilderness. They seem to want to make a move on that human Young Master Ye."
The Beast King frowned. "Has the Northern Wilderness gone mad?"
The beastman shook his head. "I don't know. I only know that the Northern Wilderness is furious!
They are all super experts above the God Realm! "
Above the Divine Realm!
The Beast King was silent, his face somewhat gloomy.
The Orc said in a deep voice, "I'm afraid that Young Master Ye is no match for this Northern Wilderness …"
After a moment of silence, the Beast King sighed in a low voice. "Call people to the Fifth Dimension!"
The orc was stunned. "King, are we going to be enemies with the Northern Wilderness?
That is … "
The Beast King's face was somewhat ugly. "Do you think I want to interfere?
Didn't you hear what that woman said?
Her brother is dead!
She wants us to be buried with him!
Buried with him!
Damn, she really doesn't listen to reason at all!
Based on what!
Based on what!
I refuse to accept this! "
The Beast King: "…"
The Beast King waved his hand. "Go and call people!"
The orc nodded and was about to leave. At this moment, a voice suddenly sounded from the side. "Call people?
There's no need to call! "
The Beast King turned his head and looked. Not far away, a woman was slowly walking over.
It was the mysterious woman from the Holy Land!
The mysterious woman looked at the Beast King and smiled. "From now on, the Beastmen are not allowed to take half a step out of the Beast World!"
The Beast King narrowed his eyes. "Who do you think you are?"
After saying that, he punched out.
The mysterious woman flicked her sleeves.
Boom!
The Beast King retreated tens of thousands of feet away. Not only that, the entire starry sky became illusory. The Beast King's right arm that punched out was shattered by a powerful force!
The Beast King was somewhat dumbfounded.
The mysterious woman looked at the Beast King and smiled. "If the Beastmen dare to take a step out of the Beast World, I will destroy your Beastmen Race!"
The Beast King stared at the mysterious woman. He was extremely shocked. "Who are you?"
The mysterious woman blinked. "I am Ye Xuan's aunt!
This is our family matter. Outsiders should not interfere, understand? "
The Beast King: "…"
....

Chapter 1486
Aunty!
The Beast King stared at the mysterious woman. "We are going to help your nephew!"
The mysterious woman smiled. "No need."
The Beast King said after a moment of silence: "You want him dead!"
A trace of surprise flashed in the mysterious woman's eyes. "How did you know?"
The Beast King looked at the mysterious woman. "Northern Wilderness is your doing!"
The mysterious woman laughed. "As expected of the Beast King. Very smart. Everything you say is right."
The Beast King said in a deep voice: "Your Excellency, do you know that he has a sister?"
The mysterious woman nodded. "I do!
The invincible Tian Ming! "
The Beast King looked at the mysterious woman with a serious expression. "Since you know, why do you still want to kill him?"
The mysterious woman smiled. "That's my business!
As for you Beastmen … Just stay in your Beastman Realm and don't come out.
I have no enmity with you and I don't want to destroy you. Do you understand? "
The Beast King was silent.
The mysterious woman looked at the Beast King and smiled. "I'm not joking with you. And I won't give you a second chance!"
Then she turned and left.
The Beast King was silent.
Not far away, the Beastman said: "King …"
The Beast King slowly closed his eyes. "I can't afford to offend my sister, and I can't afford to offend this Aunty either … Let them play by themselves!
I can't beat anyone!
I'm scared!
I'm scared! "
Then he turned and left.
...
After the mysterious woman left, she did not return to the Sacred Region. Instead, she went to the Divine City.
When she entered the tavern, the waiter and the shopkeeper's face suddenly became serious.
The shopkeeper walked in front of the mysterious woman and bowed. "Your Excellency is?"
The mysterious woman smiled. "A pot of Spring Sword."
The shopkeeper looked at the mysterious woman. "Please wait!"
Soon, the shopkeeper brought out a pot of Spring Sword.
The mysterious woman opened the bottle and gently sniffed. "Not bad."
Suddenly, a voice came from the Inner Courtyard. "What's the matter?"
The mysterious woman picked up a peanut and put it in her mouth. "I don't want to kill you. After all, we are old acquaintances."
The Inner Courtyard was silent.
The mysterious woman said again: "This is our family's private matter. Outsiders should stay out of it!
Okay? "
The Inner Courtyard was still silent.
The mysterious woman smiled and said, "I want you to give me an answer. Otherwise, I won't be polite!"
In the Inner Courtyard, a sigh sounded. "Why did you have to do this?"
The mysterious woman chuckled, "You know the reason!"
In the inner courtyard, the voice said, "After all, he is your nephew."
The mysterious woman narrowed her eyes.
Boom!
The entire tavern turned into nothingness in an instant!
The shopkeeper and the waiter's expressions changed drastically. Their eyes were filled with terror. At this moment, both of them could smell the scent of death.
The mysterious woman poured herself a cup of wine and drank it in one gulp. "Why is he still alive?"
As she spoke, she turned around to look at a small house. Even though she was smiling, it was slightly bone piercingly gloomy, and it caused others to shiver. "On what basis?"
Inside the hut, the man was silent.
The mysterious woman smiled and stood up. "For the sake of an old friend, I don't want to kill you. After all, this matter has nothing to do with you. However, I don't want you seniors to help him.
If you dare to interfere, don't blame me for being ruthless. "
Then, she stood up and left.
At this moment, the man in the hut suddenly said, "Have you ever considered his feelings?"
The mysterious woman stopped. After a moment of silence, she said, "I don't hate him. He tried his best back then. However, I still want to seek justice."
The man in the hut sighed again. "Have you ever thought about that woman?
He will be considerate and won't hurt you. However, that woman …
(To continue this chapter, please continue to the next page.)
If you do this, you will anger that woman. Once she returns, many people will die. Do you understand? "
The mysterious woman smiled and said, "So what?
Anyway, I've already prepared myself to die.
I'm not even afraid of death, so why would I be afraid of her? "
The man in the hut sighed again. "Is there really no way to resolve this matter?"
The mysterious woman smiled and walked into the distance. "Either he dies, or I die."
Soon, the mysterious woman disappeared into the distance.
At this moment, the shopkeeper came before the hut and bowed respectfully. "Master … This man …"
The man in the hut sighed softly and said no more.
....
Taoism.
After the mysterious woman left, she went directly to Taoism.
Inside the hall, the third lady sat cross-legged in front of the statue of the Taoism's ancestor.
The mysterious woman looked at the statue of the Taoism's ancestor and said with a smile, "Your master is a very amazing person!"
The third lady opened her eyes and said with a smile, "Thank you!"
The mysterious woman looked at the third lady. "You are also a smart person!"
The third lady said, "Boss, I won't interfere in the matters of the Fifth Dimension!
I don't have the ability to interfere! "
The mysterious woman smiled and said, "I'm not here to cause trouble for you!
I'm here to ask you something. "
The third lady nodded. "Boss, please speak."
The mysterious woman said, "Do you know where the Spirit of the Great Dao is?"
The Spirit of the Great Dao!
After a moment of silence, the third lady said, "To tell you the truth, I'm also looking for the Spirit of the Great Dao!"
The mysterious woman smiled and said, "You don't know either?"
The third lady nodded. "When Young Master Ye combined the nine scriptures into one, the Spirit of the Great Dao did appear!
However, for some reason, she escaped!
Logically speaking, this shouldn't be the case! "
The mysterious woman looked at the third lady. "Why do you think she escaped?"
The third lady shook her head. "I really don't know."
The mysterious woman smiled and said, "Make a guess!"
After a moment of silence, the third lady said softly, "She should have sensed the calamity on Young Master Ye, or perhaps she sensed your existence!"
The mysterious woman blinked. "Am I that scary?"
The Third Young Miss hesitated for a moment, and then she said, "Sir, you don't seem like an extremely evil person. Moreover, with your strength, you don't need the Daoist Scriptures at all, so why do you still target Ye Xuan?
Is it a personal grudge? "
The mysterious woman smiled and said, "It is indeed a personal grudge!"
The third lady nodded. "I understand."
The mysterious woman glanced at the statue of the Taoism's ancestor and said with a smile, "I'm leaving!"
With that, she turned around and left.
The third lady said, "Boss, take care!"
The mysterious woman smiled and said, "I'm not the boss. The woman in the plain dress is the real boss."
The third lady said softly, "I can't defeat them. They are all bosses!"
The mysterious woman laughed and said, "Miss, your future is limitless!"
After saying that, she disappeared.
In the hall, the third lady looked at the statue of the Taoism's ancestor and said softly, "Master … Disciple finally understands what you said. There is always someone better than you!"
....
In the Five-Dimensional Universe.
In the hall, Nian Nian was leaning on Ye Xuan's thigh and was sleeping soundly.
In front of the two of them, there were fish bones on the ground.
Ye Xuan looked at the sky outside the hall and pondered.
During this time, he had been thinking about a question. Was the mysterious expert in the Holy Land the woman who claimed to be his aunt?
If it was, it didn't make sense!
The reason why his bloodline could be awakened was because of the other party's help!
Since the other party wanted him dead, why did she help him improve his bloodline?
Ye Xuan was a little puzzled.
(This chapter is not over, please turn the page)
At this moment, Ye Xuan suddenly raised his head. The next moment, he gently placed Nian Nian on the ground and disappeared from the hall.
The moment Ye Xuan disappeared, Nian Nian suddenly opened her eyes …
...
In the Five-Dimensional Universe, Ye Xuan looked at the group of people in front of him, "Who are you!"
In front of him stood more than 30 people. These people's auras were extremely powerful and had already surpassed the God Realm!
The middle-aged man in the lead was Ge Yao!
Ge Yao stared at Ye Xuan, "Where is that woman?"
Ye Xuan frowned slightly, "Woman?
What woman? "
Ge Yao stared at Ye Xuan and slowly clenched his fists, "Your name is Ye Xuan, right?"
Ye Xuan nodded, "Yes!
Speaking of which, is there some misunderstanding? "
"Misunderstanding!"
Ge Yao's face became a little sinister, "Misunderstanding?
You're telling me it's a misunderstanding? "
As his voice fell, he suddenly blasted out a punch.
In the distance, Ye Xuan frowned slightly and raised his sword.
Boom!
The space in front of the two of them exploded. Then, Ye Xuan retreated hundreds of feet!
As for Ge Yao, he also retreated hundreds of feet!
Ge Yao stared at Ye Xuan, "I'll ask you one last time, where is that woman?"
Ye Xuan stood with his sword in hand, "Sir, I think there must be some misunderstanding between us. I think you don't want to be used by others, right?"
Ge Yao sneered, "Misunderstanding?
Ye Xuan, you actually have the nerve to say it's a misunderstanding!
You absorbed the souls of my clansmen, and then you tell me it's a misunderstanding? "
Souls!
Ye Xuan was stunned. In the next moment, his face turned ugly!
At this moment, he was sure that the mysterious enemy was his so-called aunt!
That woman was digging a hole for him!
Damn it!
This hole was too deep!
At this moment, Ge Yao sneered, "Tell me, is this a misunderstanding?"
Ye Xuan thought for a moment, then said, "I want to say that these souls were forcefully absorbed by a woman. Do you believe me?"
"Ye Xuan!"
Ge Yao suddenly said fiercely, "Do you think I'm a three year old child?
Forcefully absorbed by you?
What is she to you?
Is she your mother? "
Ye Xuan was slightly helpless, "I really didn't lie to you this time. She really did force me to absorb them!"
Ge Yao stared fixedly at Ye Xuan as if he wanted to kill Ye Xuan.
Ye Xuan was slightly speechless. Why doesn't anyone believe me when I tell the truth?
Dammit!
That woman!
At this moment, Ye Xuan felt that he was in a terrible state!
But he didn't understand why that woman would do that!
Meanwhile, Ge Yao suddenly said, "Let that woman come out!"
Ye Xuan gazed at Ge Yao, "I don't know where she is!
Really! "
Ge Yao's face was expressionless, "It's fine. I don't believe that she won't come out once I catch you!"
As he spoke, he charged directly at Ye Xuan.
Behind him, the super experts also rushed over!
At this moment, Ye Xuan suddenly held his sword horizontally to his neck. Seeing this, Ge Yao suddenly stopped and looked at Ye Xuan, "What are you doing?"
Ye Xuan looked at Ge Yao and sneered, "You want to use me to threaten my aunt? No way!
If you dare take another step forward, I'll kill myself. Let me tell you, once I die, my aunt will go crazy and take revenge on you. She will hide in the dark and take revenge on you. Let me ask you, are you afraid? "
Ge Yao narrowed his eyes, "I don't believe that you really dare to kill yourself!"
At this moment, Ye Xuan suddenly held his sword and stabbed it into his abdomen.
Pfft!
Ye Xuan immediately spat out a mouthful of blood.
Seeing this, Ge Yao was dumbfounded. Dammit, are all modern people so crazy?
Suicide just because you say so?
....

Chapter 1487
Needless to say, Ge Yao was quite stunned right now!
He really hadn't intended to kill Ye Xuan, and he'd mainly intended to capture Ye Xuan so that the mysterious woman wouldn't act against him. However, he'd never imagined that Ye Xuan would be so staunch and take his own life just like that!
That's too ruthless!
Meanwhile, Ye Xuan suddenly spoke in a hoarse voice, "So long as I die, then my Aunt will definitely stop at nothing to take revenge on all of you!"
Ge Yao gazed at Ye Xuan and spoke fiercely, "She killed countless members of our clan and even took countless treasures from us!"
Ye Xuan's eyelids twitched when he heard this. Dammit! That woman is really ruthless!
Ge Yao stared fixedly at Ye Xuan, "All of you will repay this enmity with your blood!"
Ye Xuan fell silent for a moment before he said, "I'll take all of you to her. Do all of you dare?"
Ge Yao was slightly hesitant.
Even though he'd awakened most of the experts in his clan, he still didn't have the information to deal with that mysterious woman!
That woman was too strong!
Ye Xuan hesitated for a moment before he said, "I'll tell you the truth. Don't get angry!
That is, the number of people you have is really not enough for my aunt to fight!
Do you know how strong she is? "
Ge Yao gazed at Ye Xuan, "How strong?"
Ye Xuan spoke seriously, "I don't know the specifics. All I know is that she kills Godrank Realm experts like ants, and experts above the Godrank Realm can't even withstand a single blow from her!"
Ge Yao glanced at Ye Xuan and didn't say anything.
Ye Xuan continued, "I think that the few of you aren't enough. Why don't you call more people over, and then I'll take all of you to her?"
Ge Yao gazed at Ye Xuan, "You don't seem to be worried about her!"
Ye Xuan laughed embarrassedly, "My Aunt is really good at fighting!"
Ge Yao gazed at Ye Xuan and laughed coldly, "Just you wait!
And that Aunt of yours. I'll make all of you pay the price! "
With that, he turned around and left.
Seeing that Ge Yao and the rest had left, Ye Xuan pulled out the sword from his abdomen, his face gradually darkening!
Damn it, that woman was setting him up!
He finally understood why the other party forced him to absorb those souls and even gave him treasures!
They wanted to make him a scapegoat!
Although he had obtained some benefits, it was obvious that he had formed a bad relationship with this mysterious force.
What was he trying to do?
Ye Xuan sheathed his sword and turned to leave.
At this moment, Bai Dizi appeared in front of Ye Xuan. He glanced at the end of the starry sky in the distance. "Are you alright?"
Ye Xuan shook his head. "I'll handle it!"
As soon as he finished speaking, he transformed into a ray of sword light and vanished into the distance.
In the starry sky, Bai Dizi's eyes flashed with a trace of worry.
...
Saint-level.
In front of the bamboo house, the Holy Master was bowing, and no one knew what he was saying.
After a while, the woman in the bamboo house shook her head and smiled. "This little fellow is really interesting. He sent those fellows from the Wilderness North away with just a few words!
He's just like his father. His eloquence is extraordinary! "
The Holy Master hesitated for a moment and said, "Master, what kind of force is the Wilderness North?"
The woman said softly, "It's a very, very ancient force!
They belong to the prehistoric civilization! "
The Holy Master frowned slightly. "Prehistoric civilization?"
The woman nodded. "It's a civilization that existed before the Daoist Scripture Civilization. However, there are no records of that civilization in the entire universe because the Daoist Scripture Civilization was a million years away from that civilization. During that million years, there was a blank period. In other words, it was the primitive era. During that era, there were pitifully few humans, and they didn't even have a written language. Therefore, there are no records of the prehistoric era.
As for why they sealed themselves, no one knows. "
At this point, she paused for a moment and continued. "However, this prehistoric civilization is a little strange.
Qingcheng, Ye Clan, Ancestral Hall.
"Ancestors above, Ye Xuan has no talent, no virtue … From this moment onwards, Ye Xuan's position as Crown Prince will be replaced by Ye Lang."
The one who spoke was an old man in a black robe.
Not far behind the old man stood a youth with a faint smile on his face.
This person was Ye Lang.
On both sides were the Ye Clan's Elders.
"Why?!"
At this moment, a timid voice suddenly sounded in the ancestral hall.
Everyone turned to look and saw a little girl standing at the door. She was about 12 or 13 years old, and her hands were tightly gripping the hem of her skirt. Her face had a sickly pallor, and she looked a little weak. There was even a trace of fear in her eyes.
This little girl was called Ye Ling, and she was Ye Xuan's younger sister. When she heard that the Clan wanted to dismiss Ye Xuan, she disregarded her illness and rushed over.
The black-robed old man frowned. "Ye Ling, what are you doing!"
The little girl called Ye Ling bowed to the people in the ancestral hall, and said timidly, "Great Elder, my brother Ye Xuan is a Crown Prince, why did you discard him for no reason?"
The Great Elder looked coldly at Ye Ling, "This is a Clan matter, what are you interrupting for?
Leave! "
Ye Ling was obviously afraid, and did not dare to look at the Great Elder. However, she did not leave. Instead, she plucked up her courage and entered the ancestral hall. She bowed again to the Elders on both sides, "Dear Elders, my brother is fighting with the Li Clan over the mining rights at Nanshan. He is fighting for the Clan, and we don't know if he's dead or alive. Yet, the Clan is using a groundless excuse to discard his Crown Prince position. This is unfair."
"Impudent!"
The Great Elder suddenly raged, "Discard him or not, it's not up to a little girl like you to decide.
Men, drag her away! "
At this moment, the new Crown Prince Ye Lang suddenly laughed, "You should be flogged thirty times as a warning to others!"
The Great Elder said coldly, "Then flog him thirty times!"
Soon, two guards of the Ye Clan rushed in.
Ye Ling clenched her fists, and said angrily, "This is unfair. My brother has risked his life for the Clan for so many years, and even now, he is fighting for the Clan. The Clan is so unfair to him …"
One of the guards glanced at the new Crown Prince Ye Lang, and he knew that his chance to show off had come.
The guard sneered, "Young Master Ye Lang inherits the Crown Prince position, and it is everyone's wish. What are you shouting for?" As he spoke, he raised his hand and slapped Ye Ling's face.
Slap!
A crisp slap sounded, and the right side of Ye Ling's face instantly turned red and swollen, but she did not cry. She just held her cheek tightly.
Ye Lang looked at the guard, and smiled, "What's your name?"
The guard hurriedly bowed, "I'm Zhang Mu, greeting the Crown Prince."
Ye Lang nodded, "You're not bad. After I become the Crown Prince, I will need ten guards. You can be my guard from now on."
Hearing this, Zhang Mu was overjoyed, and he hurriedly bowed deeply, "I will go through fire and water for the Crown Prince, and I will do anything for you!"
Ye Lang nodded slightly, "Drag him out. This person is disturbing the ancestral hall, so don't show any mercy. Do you understand?"
Zhang Mu glanced at Ye Lang, and when he saw the murderous intent in Ye Lang's eyes, he understood.
He immediately grabbed Ye Ling's hair and dragged her out.
At this moment, Zhang Mu seemed to have seen something, and he suddenly stopped.
In the ancestral hall, everyone turned their heads to look outside.
Not far from the ancestral hall, a young man was walking towards the ancestral hall. The young man was wearing a tight-fitting robe that was torn, and there was blood everywhere.
This person was Ye Xuan, who had rushed back from the South Mountain!
Seeing Ye Xuan, Ye Lang's mouth curled into a cold smile.
Inside the ancestral hall, the Elders frowned.
The Great Elder narrowed his eyes, and his expression was frighteningly dark. No one knew what he was thinking.
From afar, when Ye Xuan saw Zhang Mu dragging Ye Ling, his face turned savage, "Who gave you the guts to touch my sister?"
When Zhang Mu saw Ye Xuan, his face changed. He hurriedly looked at Ye Lang, and was about to speak, when Ye Xuan suddenly leaped in front of him like a ferocious tiger. Before the latter could react, Ye Xuan's fist landed on his face.
Peng!
Zhang Mu felt a wave of dizziness, and he stumbled and fell.
However, Ye Ling did not stop there. He charged towards Zhang Mu again. At this time, Ye Lang suddenly roared, "Ye Xuan, he's my man, how dare you …"
Ye Xuan suddenly stepped on Zhang Mu's chest.
Pu!
Zhang Mu spat out a mouthful of blood.
Seeing this, Ye Lang's face turned ugly. Ye Xuan looked up at him and snarled, "Your man?"
As he spoke, he stepped on Zhang Mu's face.
Zhang Mu's face turned into a bloody mess, as he screamed, "Prince, save, save me …"
Ye Xuan did not care about Zhang Mu, as he walked to Ye Ling's side. Seeing Ye Ling's appearance, Ye Xuan felt as though his heart was being sliced by a knife. He clenched his fists, and his entire body trembled.
When Ye Ling saw Ye Xuan, her tears flowed out, "Brother, it hurts, it hurts …"
Hearing this, Ye Xuan's expression turned savage. In the next instant, he charged in front of Zhang Mu, and kicked Zhang Mu's head.
Peng!
Qingcheng, Ye Clan, Ancestral Hall.
"Ancestors, Ye Xuan has no talent, no virtue … From now on, Ye Xuan's position as Prince shall be replaced by Ye Lang."
The one who spoke was an old man in black robes.
Not far behind the old man, there was a youth with a faint smile on his face.
This person was Ye Lang.
On both sides, there were the Ye Clan Elders.
"Why!?"
At this time, a timid voice rang out in the ancestral hall.
Everyone turned to look and saw a little girl standing at the door. She was about 12 or 13 years old, and her hands were tightly gripping the hem of her skirt. Her face had a sickly pallor, and she looked a little weak. There was even a trace of fear in her eyes.
This girl was called Ye Ling, and she was Ye Xuan's younger sister. When she heard that the clan wanted to remove Ye Xuan, she disregarded her illness and rushed over.
The black-robed old man frowned, "Ye Ling, what are you doing!?"
The little girl called Ye Ling bowed to the people in the ancestral hall, and said timidly, "Great Elder, my brother Ye Xuan is a Prince, why did you discard him for no reason?"
The Great Elder looked at Ye Ling coldly, "This is a matter of the clan, why are you interrupting?
Leave! "
Ye Ling was obviously afraid, not daring to look at the Great Elder, but she did not leave. Instead, she plucked up her courage and walked into the ancestral hall. She bowed to the Elders on both sides, "Elders, my brother is fighting with the Li Clan over the mining rights at Nanshan. He is fighting for the clan, and we don't know if he's dead or alive. Yet, the clan is using a groundless excuse to discard his position. This is unfair."
"Impudent!"
The Great Elder suddenly raged, "Whether he discards his position or not, it's not up to a little girl like you to decide.
Men, drag her away. "
At this time, the new Prince, Ye Lang, suddenly laughed, "You should be flogged 30 times as a warning to others!"
The Great Elder replied coldly, "Then flog her 30 times!"
Soon, two guards of the Ye Clan rushed in.
Ye Ling clenched her fists and said angrily, "This is unfair. My brother has risked his life for the clan for so many years. Even now, he is risking his life for the clan. The clan is so unfair to him …"
One of the guards glanced at the new Prince, Ye Lang. He knew that this was his chance to shine.
The guard sneered, "Young Master Ye Lang inherits the position of Prince. What are you yelling about?" As he spoke, he raised his hand and slapped Ye Ling's face.
Slap!
A crisp slap sounded, and the right side of Ye Ling's face instantly swelled up. However, she did not cry. She only covered her cheek tightly.
Ye Lang looked at the guard and smiled, "What's your name?"
The guard hurriedly bowed. "Subordinate Zhang Mu greets the Crown Prince."
Ye Lang nodded, "You're not bad. After I become the Prince, I will need 10 guards. You can be my guard from now on."
Hearing this, Zhang Mu was overjoyed. He quickly bowed deeply, "This subordinate is willing to go through fire and water for the Prince!"
Ye Lang nodded, "Drag him away. This person is disturbing the ancestral hall. Don't hold back. Do you understand?"
Zhang Mu glanced at Ye Lang. When he saw the murderous intent in Ye Lang's eyes, he understood.
He immediately grabbed Ye Ling's hair and dragged her out.
At this moment, Zhang Mu suddenly stopped as if he had seen something.
Inside the ancestral hall, everyone turned their heads to look outside the hall.
Not far from the ancestral hall, a young man was walking towards the ancestral hall. The young man was wearing a tight-fitting robe. The robe was tattered and covered in blood.
The young man was Ye Xuan, who had rushed back from Nanshan!
Seeing Ye Xuan, Ye Lang's lips curled into a sinister smile.
Inside the ancestral hall, the Elders frowned.
The Great Elder narrowed his eyes, his face dark and gloomy. No one knew what he was thinking.
From afar, when Ye Xuan saw Zhang Mu dragging Ye Ling, his face turned savage. "Who gave you the guts to touch my sister?"
When Zhang Mu saw Ye Xuan, his face changed. He quickly looked at Ye Lang and was about to speak. At this time, Ye Xuan leaped in front of him like a ferocious tiger. Before the latter could react, Ye Xuan's fist landed on his face.
Peng!
Zhang Mu felt a wave of dizziness, and he stumbled and fell.
However, Ye Ling did not stop there. He charged at Zhang Mu again. At this time, Ye Lang suddenly roared, "Ye Xuan, he's my man! How dare you …"
Ye Xuan suddenly stepped on Zhang Mu's chest.
Pu!
Zhang Mu spat out a mouthful of blood.
Seeing this, Ye Lang's face turned ugly. Ye Xuan looked up at him and said, "Your man?"
As he spoke, he stepped on Zhang Mu's face.
Zhang Mu's face turned into a bloody mess, as he screamed, "Prince, save, save me …"
Ye Xuan did not care about Zhang Mu, as he walked up to Ye Ling. Seeing Ye Ling's state, Ye Xuan felt as though his heart was being sliced apart. He clenched his fists, and his entire body trembled.
When Ye Ling saw Ye Xuan, her tears flowed, "Brother, it hurts, it hurts …"
Hearing this, Ye Xuan's expression turned savage. In the next instant, he charged in front of Zhang Mu and kicked Zhang Mu's head.
Peng!







Chapter 1488
Needless to say, Ye Xuan was a little shocked at this moment!
His own father killed his own grandfather?
Can it be played like this?
At this moment, the voice sighed softly. "It's not your father's fault. It's your grandfather who wanted to devour your father's bloodline. Moreover, your grandfather is really not a good person. These are all old matters. You will naturally know about these grudges in the future."
Ye Xuan said in a low voice, "I don't really want to know about these grudges now. I just want to know if anyone has come to take that woman!"
The voice said, "Originally, your bloodline could suppress her, but now, your bloodline has been suppressed and sealed. How can you play with her?"
Ye Xuan was speechless. "I also didn't know that my aunt was such a scammer!"
The voice said, "After all, she is your aunt. Why don't you go and talk to her? Maybe you can resolve some of the grudges from the past!
After all, you are quite good at bluffing! "
Ye Xuan was speechless.
The voice said again, "Aunt still has things to do. Take care of yourself!"
In the hall, Ye Xuan sighed softly.
Grudges!
What grudges!
What does the matters of the older generation have to do with me!
Why are they all beating me up?
After a long time, Ye Xuan sighed again and turned to leave.
I can only go and talk to that woman!
Just as Eldest Aunt said, they were a family, so why should they fight?
It would be good to talk!
Of course, I can't beat her …
...
After leaving the Four-Dimensional Universe, Ye Xuan came to the Holy Region.
Let's talk!
As soon as Ye Xuan arrived at the Holy Region, the Holy Master appeared in front of him. At this time, the Holy Master's arm had already recovered.
The Holy Master looked at Ye Xuan. "What do you want?"
Ye Xuan said with a smile, "Kill people. Oh, no, chat!
I'm here to chat! "
The Holy Master stared at Ye Xuan. "Chat!
What do we have to chat about? "
Ye Xuan pointed below. "I'm here to talk to my aunt!"
Holy Lord frowned, "Ye Xuan, what nonsense are you spouting!"
Ye Xuan blinked, "Holy Lord, don't you know that the woman below is my aunt?
My dear aunt! "
The Sacred Leader glared at Ye Xuan. "Are you here to acknowledge your kin?"
Ye Xuan nodded. "Yes!"
Saint Master was expressionless. "There's no one down there. You can leave!"
Ye Xuan chuckled. He took out the Supreme Sword and gently tapped it on his palm. He didn't say anything and just smiled.
The Sacred Lord's expression was somewhat unsightly.
Damn it, this guy is threatening me!
However, he really couldn't do anything to Ye Xuan!
God Realm experts couldn't do anything to Ye Xuan because Ye Xuan's physical body was too monstrous.
Deity Realm powerhouses were already unable to pose any substantial threat to Ye Xuan's fleshy body!
Suddenly, a voice resounded from below, "Ask him to come down!"
The Sacred Lord bowed respectfully to the people below. Then he looked at Ye Xuan and said, "You can leave now!"
Ye Xuan walked down, and it didn't take long for him to arrive before a bamboo forest. He passed through the bamboo forest and saw a bamboo house.
At this moment, a voice resounded from within the house, "Come in!"
Ye Xuan didn't hesitate and walked in. The furnishings within the house were very simple. There was only a bed, a bamboo table, and two bamboo chairs!
The woman sat before the table and was reading a book.
The woman smiled when she saw Ye Xuan, "Sit!"
Ye Xuan nodded. He sat before the woman. There was a chessboard on the table, and the white piece was in a hopeless situation!
Ye Xuan smiled, "Is this white piece me?"
The woman shook her head and smiled, "It's not you.
It's me! "
Ye Xuan frowned slightly, "You?"
The woman smiled, "Yes!
No matter where I go, I'll die in the end. "
Ye Xuan looked at the woman, "I heard from others that you're really my aunt?"
The woman nodded, "It's true, and we're related!"
Ye Xuan was puzzled, "Why did you do this to me?"
The woman smiled, "Some grudges."
Ye Xuan asked, "The older generation?"
The woman nodded.
Ye Xuan looked at the woman, "Is it appropriate for you to bully the younger generation for the grudges of the older generation?"
The woman smiled, "I can't beat the older generation!"
Hearing this, Ye Xuan's mouth twitched, and he almost went berserk!
F * ck, you can't beat the older generation, so you come to beat me?
F * ck me …
The woman smiled, "Did you come to me today to talk about this?"
Ye Xuan said, "I want to understand something!"
The woman put down the book in her hand and smiled, "Ask away!"
Ye Xuan looked at the woman, "You can kill me, right?"
The woman nodded, "I can indeed kill you, but that's under the premise that no one else interferes.
But if I touch you, someone will definitely stop me!
Just like now, although it's only the two of us, I can't kill you if I want to! "
Ye Xuan frowned, "Why?"
The woman smiled, "That's not the point!"
Ye Xuan was silent for a moment, then said, "I want to know about the grudges of the older generation!"
The woman shook her head, "I can't tell you. No, I don't want to tell you!"
Ye Xuan looked at the woman, "So you're saying that you're determined to kill me!"
The woman smiled, "Yes!"
Ye Xuan nodded, "I understand!"
With that, he stood up and left. When he walked to the door, he turned to look at the woman, "You've done so much, so it shouldn't be just to use others to kill me, right?"
The woman smiled, "Yes!"
Ye Xuan said, "The cause of disaster?"
The woman nodded.
Ye Xuan nodded slightly, "I understand."
As soon as he finished speaking, he vanished on the spot.
Within the bamboo house, the woman's smile gradually vanished. After a long time, she placed her right hand lightly on the chessboard, and in the next moment, the entire chessboard transformed into nothingness.
Everything was destroyed!
There was no winner!
...
Ye Xuan returned to the Fifth Dimension, and he looked for Bai Dizi.
Within the hall, Ye Xuan said in a low voice, "Investigate those mysterious powers that came looking for me earlier and find out their origins!"
Bai Dizi said in a low voice, "I've already sent people to investigate before you left!
However, there's no news! "
Ye Xuan said softly, "Then they should be quite far away from us."
Bai Dizi nodded, "I've already asked Black City for help, and they've agreed."
Ye Xuan hesitated for a moment before he said, "You must do it secretly. Otherwise, you might implicate them!"
Bai Dizi nodded slightly, "I understand!"
As he spoke, he hesitated for a moment before he said, "Do you know who's behind this?"
Ye Xuan nodded. "I do!"
Bai Dizi fell silent for a moment before he said, "No matter what, be careful."
Ye Xuan nodded. "I understand."
Bai Dizi was about to speak when a figure suddenly appeared within the hall. Ye Xuan looked at the figure, and the figure bowed slightly to Ye Xuan before leaving behind a scroll and vanishing.
Ye Xuan opened his palm, and the scroll appeared in his hand. He opened it, and there were only four words on it — Divine City, Northern Wilderness!
Divine City?
Northern Wilderness?
Ye Xuan exerted some force with his right hand, and the scroll vanished.
The mysterious power from before was from the Northern Wilderness!
That woman was obviously using the Northern Wilderness!
Ye Xuan fell silent for a moment before he said, "I'm going out for a while."
As soon as he finished speaking, he vanished on the spot.
...
Northern Wilderness.
Ge Yao knelt devoutly in front of the stone tablet, and behind him were dozens of super overlords.
These people had all surpassed the Immortal State.
At this moment, all of them were kneeling in front of the stone tablet.
After an unknown period of time, the stone tablet trembled slightly, and in the next moment, a woman walked out of it.
The woman only wore a black tube top, and most of her skin was exposed to the air. She only wore a very short leather skirt, and her legs were as white as jade.
After the woman appeared, she slowly closed her eyes, and Ge Yao and the others in front of her hurriedly bowed respectfully. "Greetings, Divine Envoy!"
The woman gently hooked her finger, and a black gauze suddenly appeared on her body, which made her look even sexier.
After a while, the woman suddenly opened her eyes, and her gaze pierced through the starry sky, directly to the Sacred Region.
Inside the bamboo house, the mysterious woman who was reading a book suddenly opened her eyes. She turned her head to take a look and said with a smile, "Interesting!
It seems that I've underestimated this prehistoric civilization. "
...
Northern Wilderness.
The Divine Envoy opened her palm, and a machete suddenly appeared in her hand. In the next moment, she lightly slashed in front of her.
Whoosh!
The space in front of her cracked, and almost at the same time, in the bamboo house in the Sacred Region, the space in front of the mysterious woman suddenly cracked, and a black blade flashed out.
The mysterious woman's expression was calm, and she lightly pointed with her fingers.
Boom!
The blade shook violently, and then slowly turned into nothingness.
The Divine Envoy swung the blade again.
Whoosh!
A blade suddenly appeared between the mysterious woman's eyebrows, but the blade stopped half an inch away from the mysterious woman's eyebrows!
This was because the mysterious woman's jade-like fingers had caught the blade!
The mysterious woman gently pinched the blade with her fingers, and the blade turned into nothingness. Then, she lightly pointed forward —
In the Sacred Region, the space in front of the Divine Envoy suddenly cracked, and a finger shot out.
The Divine Envoy's expression was calm. She opened her palm, and countless blade auras flew out of it.
Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh!
In an instant, the finger was directly cut into powder.
In the Sacred Region, inside the bamboo house, the woman smiled and did not attack again.
In the Northern Wilderness, the Divine Envoy also did not attack again. Several blade auras flew around her.
Ge Yao hesitated, and then asked, "Divine Envoy?"
The Divine Envoy said softly, "Very strong!"
Very strong.
Hearing this, Ge Yao's expression became serious.
The Divine Envoy slowly closed her eyes. "This woman forced her way into the Northern Wilderness, took those souls, and bullied the Northern Wilderness … Just for that young man Ye Xuan?"
Ge Yao nodded. "Yes!
That young man has already absorbed those souls! "
Then, she paused, and then said, "That young man is not simple, especially his body, which is extremely powerful, and his bloodline has extremely strong healing abilities."
The Divine Envoy was expressionless. "I'll go and see this person. You guys wait here for the Underworld Envoy."
Underworld Envoy!
Hearing this, Ge Yao's heart jumped, and he quickly nodded. "Yes!"
The Divine Envoy did not speak again. She took a step forward, and with that, she disappeared from the Northern Wilderness …

Chapter 1489
In the starry sky, Ye Xuan rode on his flying sword. After a long time, he arrived at the God City.
Just as he was about to step into the God City, a powerful divine sense suddenly enveloped him.
Ye Xuan frowned slightly. At this moment, that divine sense suddenly disappeared without a trace.
Ye Xuan was slightly startled. A moment later, he continued forward. There was only a small tavern in the city. The small tavern was very new, as if it had just been built.
Ye Xuan walked into the tavern. Inside the tavern, there were only two people. One was the tavern manager, and the other was a waiter.
At this moment, both of them were looking at Ye Xuan.
Ye Xuan was a little baffled by their gazes. He asked, "Do the two of you know me?"
The waiter looked at the manager. The manager waved his hand and the waiter retreated.
The manager looked at Ye Xuan and said with a smile, "Do you want to drink?
The best wine here is Spring Sword! "
Ye Xuan thought for a moment and said with a smile, "I'll have a pot."
The manager smiled and said, "Please sit."
Ye Xuan walked to the side and sat down. The manager immediately brought over a pot of wine and two side dishes.
Just as the manager was about to leave, Ye Xuan suddenly smiled and said, "Let's have a chat?"
The manager hesitated for a moment before nodding, "Sure!"
He sat in front of Ye Xuan.
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "Senior knows me!"
The manager smiled, "Why do you say so?"
Ye Xuan said, "When I first came in, the way you looked at me."
The manager was silent.
Ye Xuan suddenly asked, "I'll be more direct. Are you in cahoots with that woman?"
The manager seemed to know who Ye Xuan was talking about. He immediately shook his head, "No!"
No!
Ye Xuan asked again, "Do you know me?"
The manager nodded, "My master knows you!"
Ye Xuan was a little curious, "Your master?
Can I meet him? "
The manager shook his head. "It's not convenient for the time being!"
Ye Xuan smiled and asked, "Why?"
The manager hesitated for a moment before he said, "Young Master Ye, your true objective for coming here this time is for that woman, right?"
Ye Xuan nodded.
The innkeeper sighed in a low voice. "Young Master Ye, to be honest, that woman also came to the tavern … and we couldn't do anything to her."
After a moment of silence, Ye Xuan smiled and said, "Then I'll ask about the Northern Wilderness!"
Northern Wilderness!
The shopkeeper said, "We know a little about Dao Yi. The Northern Wilderness is a prehistoric civilization, a civilization before the Dao Scripture. Their cultivation system is completely different from ours. Their cultivation system is also different!
Moreover, they also cultivate Faith Energy, but it's different from ours. Moreover, some of their cultivation methods are very special. For example, they cultivate Psychokinesis, which we know nothing about. Apart from that, they also cultivate Underworld Energy, a special kind of power … "
As he said this, his expression became serious.
Ye Xuan smiled bitterly. "To tell you the truth, that woman must have gone to the Desolate North. Then she brought out the souls of some of the Desolate North's powerhouses and let me absorb them …"
The innkeeper looked at Ye Xuan and asked, "You absorbed them?"
Ye Xuan shrugged. "She forced me to absorb them!"
The innkeeper said in a deep voice, "She wants to make the Northern Wilderness your enemy!"
Ye Xuan nodded.
After a moment of silence, the innkeeper said, "What are you going to do?"
Ye Xuan said, "I want to go to the Northern Wilderness and clear up this misunderstanding. But I'm afraid I won't be able to return. They are not only strong, but they also have a lot of people."
The innkeeper hesitated and said, "You absorbed all the souls?"
Ye Xuan nodded.
The innkeeper sighed again. "That's not a simple problem."
Ye Xuan said in a deep voice, "I'm not particularly worried about the Northern Wilderness. I'm worried about that woman. My intuition tells me that she's plotting something!"
The innkeeper nodded. "Master also said that she's plotting something. It's not just to cause trouble for you. It might have something to do with the Cause of Misfortune on you!"
Ye Xuan nodded. "My guess is also the Cause of Misfortune. But I don't know the specifics."
The innkeeper glanced at Ye Xuan. "Young Master Ye, you can't fight her alone. Master suggests that you find someone from the older generation!"
Ye Xuan shrugged. "I can't find anyone!
By the way, can you help me contact Qing 'er? "
The innkeeper asked. "The woman in the plain dress?"
Ye Xuan nodded.
The innkeeper shook his head. "No!"
Ye Xuan was puzzled. "Why?"
The innkeeper said in a deep voice, "Young Master Ye, Master also doesn't suggest that you let that senior come back!
Because if she comes back, things will become more complicated. Also, your aunt's target might be the woman in the plain dress … "
Ye Xuan frowned. "Kill Qing 'er?"
The innkeeper shook his head. "She doesn't have that ability!
She might be plotting against you and the woman in the plain dress. The only thing that can restrain the woman in the plain dress is the Cause of Misfortune. So … "
When he spoke up to here, he sighed softly. "Actually, Master isn't too sure about her true objective. The only thing I know is that it's related to the Disaster Cause. Because if she wants to kill you, she can only rely on the Disaster Cause!"
Ye Xuan suddenly asked. "Can I see your Master?"
The innkeeper shook his head. "Master can't see you. Please understand."
Ye Xuan nodded. "I understand. Let's talk about the Northern Wilderness!
The Northern Wilderness now sees me as their mortal enemy. Although I tricked them into leaving, I believe that they will definitely come back soon … "
The innkeeper suddenly said. "Go find Miss Ding!"
"Miss Ding?"
Ye Xuan blinked. "Who is it?"
The innkeeper took out a scroll and placed it in front of Ye Xuan. "Young Master Ye, take care!"
Then, he got up and left.
Ye Xuan was silent for a long time. He picked up the scroll and left.
Not long after, he suddenly turned around. Not far away, the tavern suddenly burst into flames. Soon, the entire tavern turned into nothingness.
Ye Xuan said softly. "I'm sorry. I didn't know I would implicate you … Thank you!"
Then, he turned around and left.
In the starry sky, Ye Xuan opened the scroll. It was actually a map.
Miss Ding?
Ye Xuan was curious. Who was this Miss Ding that the tavern senior mentioned?
Would he implicate her if he went to find her?
After a moment of silence, Ye Xuan finally chose to find this Miss Ding. Otherwise, who knew what would happen if he allowed that woman to continue?
He really couldn't beat her!
Even now, he still didn't know how strong that woman was!
Since it was a grudge between the older generation, it was better to let the older generation solve it themselves!
I won't take the blame!
...
In the Fifth Dimension. On this day, a woman suddenly arrived in the starry sky of the Fifth Dimension.
It was the Divine Envoy!
The Divine Envoy stood in the starry sky and looked down at the Fifth Dimension. After a long time, a trace of surprise flashed in her eyes. "This universe … is a bit interesting …"
Then, she suddenly turned around. Not far away, there stood a little girl!
Mu Niannian!
The Divine Envoy looked at Mu Niannian. After a while, she looked at the candied fruit in Mu Niannian's hand and said softly.
"You are very strong!"
Mu Niannian said: "The Northern Wilderness?"
The Divine Envoy nodded.
Mu Niannian said with a smile: "Want to talk?"
The Divine Envoy looked at Mu Niannian's candied fruit and asked: "Is there a need to talk?"
Mu Niannian smiled slightly. "That woman is using you!"
The Divine Envoy looked calm. "That woman wants to use us to target that young man?"
Mu Niannian said with a smile: "It seems that I can save my breath!
However, I am a bit curious. How did you know?
Or is it just a guess? "
The Divine Envoy slowly clenched her right hand that was hidden behind her back. "I have fought with her. She is very strong. It is meaningless for such a strong person to snatch those souls. Those treasures are also meaningless to her.
Then, there are only two possibilities left. First, she is really doing it for that young man. Second, she is framing that young man and wants the Northern Wilderness to become enemies with that young man. "
Then, she looked down. "This time, I came to see that young man and this universe!
This universe is not simple. You are very strong.
However, you are a bit strange. You are in a very strange state now! "
Mu Niannian said with a smile: "Strange state?"
The Divine Envoy nodded. "There seems to be something bothering you!"
Mu Niannian smiled. "The Cause of Misfortune!"
The Divine Envoy frowned. "The Cause of Misfortune?"
Mu Niannian asked: "There is no Cause of Misfortune in your era?"
The Divine Envoy said softly: "You are talking about the Body of Misfortune."
Mu Niannian was a bit curious. "The Body of Misfortune?"
The Divine Emissary nodded. "The Cause of Disaster you mentioned should be what we call the Body of Disaster, the source of all evil karma … However, this kind of person has never appeared even in our era. In our era, there was a Good Body … As for this Body of Disaster, not only did it not appear in our era, it did not even appear in the most ancient era."
Mu Niannian licked the candied fruit and said: "Do you have a way to solve this Body of Misfortune?"
The Divine Envoy looked at Mu Niannian's candied fruit again. "Yes!"
Mu Niannian blinked. "There is?"
The Divine Envoy said: "The Body of Misfortune cannot be directly erased or changed, but it can be reversed, forcibly reversed!"
Mu Niannian asked: "How do you reverse it?"
The Divine Envoy looked at Mu Niannian. "Become stronger!
So strong that no karma can touch you. "
Mu Niannian was silent.
Wasn't she talking about the woman in the plain dress?
That woman was the one who no karma dared to touch!
But it was still very difficult for Ye Xuan to reach the level of the woman in the plain dress, at least not in a short time.
At this moment, the Divine Envoy suddenly said: "That young man can live until now with the Body of Misfortune is because someone is blocking the source of the Body of Misfortune for him, right?"
Mu Niannian nodded. "Yes!"
The Divine Envoy frowned slightly. "Someone can do that?"
Mu Niannian smiled. "Yes!"
The Divine Envoy shook his head. "Impossible … This Cause of Misfortune is simply … No, you have no reason to lie to me. Moreover, that young man is indeed still alive."
Mu Niannian licked the candied fruit and smiled. It was good to talk to smart people because you didn't have to explain too much nonsense.
At this moment, the Divine Envoy suddenly asked: "What are you licking?"
Mu Niannian smiled. "Candied fruit!"
The Divine Envoy hesitated. "It looks delicious. Can I lick it?"
Mu Niannian blinked and said: "This … This is a divine item. It blooms every ten thousand years and bears fruit every ten thousand years. Look at this string of mine, there are six of them. They have been bearing fruit for sixty thousand years!"
The Divine Envoy: "…"
...







Chapter 1490
Sixty thousand years old!
The Saint blinked. "Really?"
Mu Niannian said seriously, "Of course!
However, I can give you a skewer. "
With that, she took out a skewer of candied haws and handed it to the Saint.
The Saint hesitated for a moment before taking the candied haws. She licked it gently. It was a little sweet and sour, but there was no spiritual energy or energy. She looked at Mu Niannian and asked, "Why doesn't this thing have any energy or spiritual energy?"
Nian Nian blinked, feeling a little awkward. How was she going to fool him?
Fortunately, the Saint did not continue to ask this question. She licked it again and said, "This thing is sour and sweet. There's an indescribable feeling when you lick it."
Mu Niannian smiled and said, "Delicious, right?"
The Saint nodded. "Indeed!"
With that, she glanced at Mu Niannian and said, "I can't take it from you for free!"
When she spoke up to here, she opened her palm to reveal a pure white spirit fruit. As soon as it appeared, a wave of pure spiritual energy instantly spread out from her palm.
Nian Nian blinked. "This is?"
The Saint said, "My clan's sacred fruit. It blooms every ten thousand years and bears fruit every ten thousand years. After eating, it can cleanse the marrow and nourish the limbs and bones … Most importantly, it tastes good and delicious!"
Nian Nian looked at the Saint. "Is it for me?"
The Saint nodded. "Yes."
Nian Nian smiled and said, "Actually, this candied haw isn't that precious!"
The Saint nodded. "I know!
This thing should be some snacks of this era, right? "
Nian Nian nodded. "Yes."
The Saint smiled slightly. "No matter what, I ate your candied haw and I don't like to owe others, so you can keep it!"
Nian Nian shook her head. "You have your principles and I have mine. Just give me a skewer of candied haw in the future."
The Saint thought for a moment and said, "That's fine too!"
Nian Nian smiled and said, "Let's talk about that woman. Are you interested?"
The Saint nodded. "Yes."
Nian Nian smiled and said, "You already know the truth. What are you going to do now?"
The Saint shook his head. "I don't know how strong she is, and I don't know what she will do next."
As she said that, she looked at Mu Niannian. "Because you're affected by the Disaster Constitution, you can't attack openly, right?"
Nian Nian nodded. "Yes."
The Divine Envoy said softly, "Then things will be a bit tricky."
Nian Nian said, "If I'm not wrong, she should have a backup plan, but we don't know what this backup plan is for now.
Most importantly, you've already seen through her scheme. I'm worried that she has already anticipated this and has a backup plan. "
The Saint nodded slightly. "That's what I'm worried about."
As she spoke, she shook her head. "I wanted to talk to her, but she didn't want to."
Nian Nian blinked. "Why don't we join forces?"
The Saint was silent.
Nian Nian asked, "Are you worried about the Body of Disaster?"
The Sage nodded. "Yes!"
Nian Nian smiled and said, "She killed many of your people."
The Saint looked at Nian Nian. "But if we continue to be enemies with her without knowing her true strength, we might lose more people. Moreover, her real intention is to target you. My clan doesn't want to get involved in this mess for now."
Nian Nian nodded. "I understand!
However, you guys still have to be careful. She probably won't let this go! "
The Saint nodded. "Thank you for the reminder."
As she said that, she licked the candied fruit and said, "I still have something to do. We'll talk another day."
With that, she turned and left.
Nian Nian looked at the Saint in the distance and remained silent.
'What will that woman do next?'
...
Somewhere in the starry sky, Ye Xuan was flying on his sword. He didn't know where he was going because he was following the map.
Miss Ding!
He was also curious about this Miss Ding. The tavern owner had asked him to look for her. She should be able to restrain that woman, right?
At this moment, the space not far away from him suddenly trembled. Ye Xuan frowned slightly and clenched his right hand tightly.
He clenched the sword in his hand because he felt a murderous intent!
A murderous intent that came out of nowhere!
At this moment, the murderous intent suddenly disappeared. The next moment, the space split open and a woman walked out!
It was the mysterious woman from the Sacred Land.
Ye Xuan looked at the woman in silence.
The woman said with a smile, "Are you going to look for help?"
Ye Xuan hurriedly shook his head. "No!
I'm just strolling around! "
The woman laughed and said, "I like to see you lie with your eyes wide open. It's really interesting!"
Ye Xuan was speechless.
The woman said with a smile, "Go back!"
Ye Xuan looked at the woman. "Are you afraid that I'll look for that person?"
The woman shook her head. "I'm not afraid because she can't do anything to me. However, with her around, it'll be a little troublesome to carry out many of my plans because she knows me better than Miss Nian and knows more than Miss Nian!"
Ye Xuan was silent.
The woman looked at Ye Xuan and said with a smile, "Are you going back yourself, or do you want me to beat you up?"
Ye Xuan looked at the woman. "How about a spar?"
The woman said with a smile, "Are you serious?"
Ye Xuan nodded. "I'm serious!
Hmm … it's a spar, the kind where we stop when it's appropriate! "
The woman laughed. "Stop when it's appropriate!
Since you want to know my strength, then come! "
Ye Xuan suddenly disappeared from the spot.
Chi!
The space in front of the woman suddenly tore open and a sword beam appeared an inch away from the woman's eyebrows.
Instant Kill Sword!
Extreme Instant Kill Sword!
However, such a fast sword was caught by two fingers!
The woman held onto Ye Xuan's sword and smiled. "A very fast sword. However, even Tingyun can't do anything to me with this sword, let alone you!"
As she said that, her fingers trembled slightly.
Boom!
Ye Xuan and his sword were sent flying hundreds of feet away!
The woman looked at Ye Xuan. "Again!"
Ye Xuan looked at the woman. The next moment, he suddenly appeared in front of the woman. Immediately after, four types of Domains enveloped the woman. At the same time, he held the sword with both hands and slashed forward.
He used all his strength in this sword!
Of course, it lacked the Crazy Demon Bloodline Power!
Even so, the power of this sword was enough to destroy heaven and earth. However, even with the support of four types of Domains, this sword was still caught by the woman's two fingers!
The woman's two fingers trembled slightly.
Boom!
Ye Xuan's four types of Domains were directly shattered. At the same time, he was sent flying hundreds of feet away.
Ye Xuan looked at the sword in his hand in silence.
He was crushed!
This woman's strength was far above his. Even if he used the Power of Faith, he might not be able to do anything to this woman.
The woman sized up Ye Xuan. "Four types of Domains. It's quite rare. However, it's a pity that your four types of Domains are of a low level. You haven't grasped the true essence of Domains!"
Ye Xuan frowned slightly. "Low level?"
The woman nodded and smiled. "You can't really think that Domains are so trashy, right?"
Ye Xuan hesitated for a moment. "Are Domains very strong?"
The woman smiled. "Of course. Although you have four types of Domains, you haven't grasped the essence of Domains. Therefore, your power is mediocre."
Ye Xuan said in a low voice. "How can I display the true power of this Domain?"
The woman blinked. "Are you asking me?"
Ye Xuan: "…"
The woman smiled. "I won't tell you!
Otherwise, if you're too strong, you'll only make things difficult for me. "
Ye Xuan said in a low voice. "Are you afraid that I'll become stronger?"
The woman smiled. "If you want to be a threat to me, you'll need at least 30 years, or even longer. Therefore, within 30 years, it doesn't matter how you jump around. However, I can't take the initiative to help you improve!
Isn't that looking for trouble for myself? "
Ye Xuan was silent.
The woman smiled. "Don't worry. I won't target the people around you. I won't use your relatives to threaten you.
You can rest assured. "
Ye Xuan glanced at the woman. "In that case, I should be thanking you!"
The woman smiled. "I can understand you. After all, it's a grudge of the older generation. You have to take the blame!
But there's no other way. This matter has something to do with you. Moreover, I really can't beat the older generation. I can only beat you. "
Ye Xuan looked calm. "You're really straightforward.
Speaking of which, I'm curious. Do you have some kind of blood feud with my mother? "
The woman smiled. "Sort of!"
Ye Xuan frowned. "You're sisters!
Is there such a big grudge? "
The woman shook her head. "I can't tell you about this."
Ye Xuan was silent for a moment. He asked again. "I heard from a senior that my grandfather was killed?"
The woman nodded. "Yes."
Ye Xuan continued to ask. "My father did it?"
The woman nodded. "Your grandfather's death … I can only say that he deserved it.
Although it's a bit unfilial to say this, he has done too many evil things!
Moreover, when you were born, he wanted to kill you! "
Ye Xuan was stunned. "My grandfather wanted to kill me?"
The woman nodded. "Yes!"
Ye Xuan wiped the cold sweat off his forehead. Damn it. It's not easy for me to live until now!
The woman suddenly smiled. "Let's go back!"
Ye Xuan looked at the woman. "Can we make an agreement?"
The woman smiled. "Let's hear it!"
Ye Xuan said in a deep voice. "No matter what happens in the future, don't make a move on the Fifth Dimension. Don't make a move on the people around me. Of course, I won't make the Fifth Dimension and the people around you your enemy!
This is a grudge between the two of us. What do you think? "
The woman smiled. "Sure!
However, I won't make a move on the Fifth Dimension. I won't show mercy to some people from the older generation who helped you. "
Ye Xuan was silent for a moment. "Okay!"
After saying that, he turned around and left.
Not long after Ye Xuan left, a shadow quietly appeared behind the woman. The shadow gradually solidified. It was a woman wearing an emerald green dress. There were some leaf-like things on the woman's head. It looked quite strange.
The woman who had just appeared stared at Ye Xuan at the end of the starry sky in the distance. Her eyes were filled with killing intent.
The mysterious woman suddenly smiled. "You can't just kill him like that. Do you understand?
Moreover, what's the point of killing him?
After all, the person you want to kill is Tian Ming. "
The woman in the emerald green dress was expressionless. "If I kill him, that woman will definitely be in pain, right?"
The mysterious woman smiled. "And then?
Then she will end you with a sword?
Also, we can't kill him now. Don't underestimate that Miss Nian Nian. "
The woman in the emerald green dress was silent.
The mysterious woman suddenly said, "How's the contact going?"
The woman in the emerald green dress said solemnly, "I've already contacted some people. However, most of them don't dare to participate in this matter because they fear Tian Ming."
As she said that, she looked at the mysterious woman. "How do you plan to deal with that man and that woman?"
The mysterious woman raised her head to look at the end of the starry sky and said softly, "Our appearance is the best chance for this Disaster Cause. I don't believe it won't seize this opportunity … This Disaster Cause will definitely help us … If I'm not wrong, this Disaster Cause is about to make a move."
....
In a certain part of the starry sky, a woman was walking slowly.
It was the woman in the white dress!
At that moment, the woman in the white dress suddenly stopped. The blood-red threads around her suddenly trembled violently. They surrounded the woman in the white dress like a huge ball, wrapping around her. However, it was very difficult for them to approach her. At the same time, the space in front of the woman suddenly turned blood-red. Within that blood-red space, there was a blood-red door.
The woman in the white dress slowly closed her eyes. After a long while, she turned her head to take a look and sneered. "You're playing with me?
If it weren't for the fact that you're his mother, I would've ended you with my sword long ago!
You don't even recognize your own son. What the hell! "
After saying that, she walked towards the blood-red door.
...
PS: Updated one minute late, one more chapter!







Chapter 1491
As the plain-dressed woman walked towards the blood-red door, the starry sky around her had already turned blood-red. The entire starry sky was like a sea of blood. It was extremely strange!
The plain-dressed woman walked slowly. Her expression was calm as the number of blood-red threads around her increased. When she reached the blood-red door, those blood-red threads had already covered the entire starry sky!
If someone was here, they would definitely be scared to death!
This was too terrifying!
Karmic Threads!
Endless Karmic Threads of Disaster!
These Karmic Threads of Disaster should be on Ye Xuan's body. However, they had been shouldered by the plain-dressed woman. Of course, these Karmic Threads of Disaster couldn't do anything to her. However, she couldn't sever them all because new threads would appear even if she severed them. Therefore, she didn't sever them all.
The plain-dressed woman walked towards the blood-red door. Behind the door was a long blood-red path that seemed to have no end.
When she entered the blood-red door, she suddenly turned her head to look at the Karmic Threads of Disaster. She could see countless things from these Karmic Threads of Disaster.
Many of the Karmic Threads of Disaster were related to her and the green-robed man. However, there were also some that didn't belong to her and the green-robed man!
They belonged to Ye Xuan himself!
The degree of terror of these Karmic Threads of Disaster wasn't any less than the ones she and the green-robed man had.
Everyone had a past life, present life, and a future life. However, when a person's strength reached a certain level, they could sever their past life and future life.
The green-robed man had done it!
She had also done it!
She wouldn't be tainted by any karma. She would be herself.
However, Ye Xuan couldn't do it.
What was she really worried about?
She was worried that Ye Xuan's past life would determine his present life.
Some powerful people could be reborn after reaching a certain level. Moreover, they could control their own rebirth.
After such people were reborn, they would gradually regain their past life's memories. If they were strong enough in their present life, they might be able to maintain their current state. However, if they weren't strong enough, they might become their past life's self.
Was there a difference?
There was definitely a difference. Because once the past life's memories were restored, the person at that time would no longer be him!
The reason why Ye Xuan was still himself now was because she had blocked everything from his previous life. All the karmic threads from his previous life had basically landed on her.
Of course, this was only her guess. She was not sure if it was Ye Xuan's doing in his previous life, or if someone else was doing it, or if he was doing it himself, or if someone was helping him …
Regardless of the reason, she was certain that Ye Xuan's identity was not simple. In fact, it was becoming more and more complicated.
Before this, what gave her a headache was that the Disaster Cause had been lurking in the dark, leaving her powerless.
But now, the Cause of Disaster could no longer hold back!
When she thought up to here, the woman in a plain dress put away the wooden doll, and then she turned around to glance below. At this glance, she directly saw the mysterious woman from the Hallowed Grounds, and she had an expressionless face. "A bunch of ants. If it wasn't for the fact that you're his mother, I would have killed you a long time ago!
Are you even worthy of showing off your intelligence? "
After saying that, she entered the blood-red door.
In fact, the mysterious woman from the Hallowed Grounds did not know that the woman in a plain dress wanted to make a move against the Disaster Cause even more than she did …
If the Disaster Cause did not make a move and kept hiding, she really could not do anything to it. But if the Disaster Cause made a move and let her know where the Disaster Cause was, then it would be different.
After the woman in a plain dress disappeared, the blood-red door in the starry sky slowly became illusory. After a while, it disappeared, and the surrounding starry sky also returned to normal.
....
In the Hallowed Grounds, the mysterious woman in the bamboo house suddenly raised her head.
After being silent for a long time, she softly said, "No, they might not have gone far. We have to wait a little longer. We can't rush …"
After saying that, she lowered her head and continued to read the ancient book.
At this moment, the Sacred Master's voice came from outside the door. "Master, the people from the Desolate North have already gone to the Fifth Dimension!"
The woman nodded. "I know."
The Sacred Master hesitated for a moment, then said, "Will the Desolate North ally with the Fifth Dimension?"
The woman shook her head. "They wouldn't dare."
The Sacred Master was somewhat puzzled. "Why?"
The woman smiled and said, "They won't want to get involved in this mess!"
The Sacred Master said in a deep voice. "But if they know that this is a conspiracy of yours, Master …"
The woman shook her head and smiled. "As long as Ye Xuan absorbs those souls, it will be fine. Those souls are evil causes.
Although I forced him to absorb them, he still benefited from it.
As for the Desolate North, the Sacred Envoy doesn't represent the entire Desolate North. Moreover, as long as there are enough benefits, the Desolate North will kill Ye Xuan. "
Although the Sacred Master still had some doubts in his heart, he didn't ask anymore. Instead, he quietly retreated.
Outside the bamboo forest, the Sacred Master sighed.
He knew that his master must have some big plan. Recently, some extremely powerful auras appeared in the Hallowed Grounds. However, he didn't know who these people were, and he didn't dare to ask.
...
Ye Xuan returned to the Fifth Dimension. Somewhere in the cultivation room, Ye Xuan opened his right hand and slowly clenched it. In an instant, a powerful force condensed in his right hand!
Life Fist!
He had to admit that the power of this Life Fist was very powerful. However, he knew that even if he burned one thousand years of his life, the Life Fist would not be able to do anything to that woman.
Ye Xuan slowly loosened his right hand.
This was the first time he felt so powerless!
Although he had many enemies in the past, and they were all powerful, they were completely incomparable to this mysterious woman. Now, he felt that the woman was in control of everything.
The biggest disadvantage was that the woman knew everything about him, while he didn't know much about her!
As if he had thought of something, Ye Xuan suddenly opened his hands, and a mysterious force suddenly overflowed from his body.
The power of faith!
At this moment, his power of faith was unprecedentedly powerful!
This was because it could be said that he had gathered the power of faith of the entire Fifth Dimension. Moreover, this power of faith was very pure.
It could be said that this power of faith would increase his strength to an extremely terrifying level.
However, his use of the power of faith was very simple and crude. That was to use it to forcibly increase his own strength!
Domain!
Ye Xuan suddenly displayed his sword domain. His sword domain directly enveloped the entire cultivation room. After the sword domain appeared, he crazily released his power of faith. Endless power of faith entered his sword domain.
Excitement gradually appeared in Ye Xuan's eyes.
Because he noticed that the sword domain was actually undergoing a transformation when the power of faith entered it!
As if he'd thought of something, Ye Xuan suddenly said, "Condense!"
As soon as he finished speaking, a sword suddenly appeared in his hand. It was an illusory sword!
It was a sword condensed from the power of faith he'd condensed!
Ye Xuan held the sword in his hand and slowly closed his eyes. At this moment, his sword domain had undergone a tremendous transformation.
The sword domain that was supported by the power of faith and the sword Dao Yi was countless times stronger than his original sword domain. Moreover, he was able to increase the effects of the power of faith to its limits within this sword domain. Moreover, he could even utilize this sword domain to improve the might of his Sword Dao!
The power of faith could strengthen the sword domain, and the sword domain could strengthen his Sword Dao!
Ye Xuan clenched his fists tightly.
He looked into the distance with the sword of faith in his hand. At this moment, he really wanted to slash out. The power of this sword would definitely destroy the world.
However, this was the Fifth Dimension. Naturally, he couldn't use his sword. If he did, it would severely damage the origin of the Fifth Dimension!
Ye Xuan put away his sword and continued to ponder the power of faith and sword domain.
He originally wanted to rush to the Consolidation Realm. However, he felt that he should stabilize his current realm. After all, he'd just reached the Dao Attainment Realm not long ago.
As for his physical body, it hadn't been long since he'd reached the Consolidation Realm. It would be very difficult to improve it again.
Since he couldn't improve his realm and physical body, he would improve his Sword Dao and sword domain!
Especially the sword domain. He didn't know when it started, but he rarely used it. Against ordinary enemies, he didn't even need to use the sword domain. He could instantly kill them with one strike!
However, against some enemies, the sword domain was completely useless. For example, against that mysterious woman, the sword domain was completely useless!
And that woman's words made him understand that it wasn't that the sword domain was weak, but that he hadn't developed it yet!
In the following time, Ye Xuan began to study the sword domain and the power of faith. Not only that, but he also studied the sword of instant death. With the blessing of the sword domain and the power of faith, the power of the sword of instant death could also be greatly enhanced. Especially in the space covered by the sword domain, the speed of the sword of instant death was already indescribable … It could be said that the speed was so fast that even he couldn't resist it.
The power of faith and sword domain allowed Ye Xuan to discover a new continent.
In the blink of an eye, one month passed.
During this month, Ye Xuan hid in the cultivation room every day. As for the matters of the Fifth Dimension, he was relieved that Bai Dizi and the others were handling it. Moreover, Bai Dizi and the others didn't disturb him.
Apart from cultivating, Ye Xuan had been reading books for the past month!
He read the ancient books that Nian Nian had collected!
Not only that, he also asked Bai Dizi to collect all the books related to the sword path in the Fifth Dimension, especially those from the Sword Sect.
Just as the white-robed Qing 'er said, his current sword path had reached its end. He could only walk the next path by himself. However, if he wanted to walk his own path, learning was indispensable.
He wanted to improve his attainments in the Sword Dao to the next level!
During this time, there was no movement from the Sacred Domain.
On this day, the Sacred Master came to the bamboo house. The Sacred Master glanced inside the bamboo house and saw that there were two women inside.
The Sacred Master bowed slightly. "Master, that Ye Xuan seems to be cultivating crazily!"
The mysterious woman said with a smile, "Let him be!"
The Sacred Master hesitated for a moment and then said, "Master, aren't you worried?"
The mysterious woman said, "You can leave!"
The Sacred Master didn't dare to say anything else and immediately left.
...
Inside the bamboo house, the mysterious woman looked at the woman in front of her. The woman was wearing an emerald green dress and there were a few broken leaves in her hair.
The mysterious woman said with a smile, "Tree Boundless, you are too anxious!"
Tree Boundless' expression was cold. "She has already left!
Are you still not going to act? "
The mysterious woman shook her head. "Not enough, because I can still feel a trace of her aura …"
Tree Boundless suddenly asked, "What if she comes back?"
The mysterious woman was silent.
Tree Boundless looked at the woman. "You have thought about this problem, right?"
The mysterious woman said softly, "She will not come back."
Tree Boundless frowned slightly. "Why?"
The mysterious woman said with a smile, "In her eyes, you and I are both ants."
.....







Chapter 1492
Ants!
Tree Boundless was silent.
How strong was that woman?
She had personally experienced it!
So strong that it made people feel despair!
In this world, who could suppress the plain-dressed woman?
No one!
Even the green-robed man could only fight against the plain-dressed woman, but if the plain-dressed woman went crazy, the green-robed man could not stop her.
In the eyes of that woman, apart from a few people, who was not an ant?
In front of Tree Boundless, the mysterious woman suddenly smiled and said, "Of course, if she comes back, it is also a good thing."
Tree Boundless looked at the mysterious woman and asked, "What do you mean?"
The mysterious woman smiled and said, "The reason why Ye Xuan can live so comfortably now is because she is at the front. If she returns to Ye Xuan's side, who will be at the front?
Of course, she can always stay by Ye Xuan's side, but if she stays by Ye Xuan's side, Ye Xuan will never be able to grow.
The path of the Great Dao is walked by oneself. This is also the reason why she left Ye Xuan, because she wants Ye Xuan to grow on his own. "
Saying that, she shook her head and smiled, "In her heart, the enemies of this universe, including us, are all Ye Xuan's whetstones."
Tree Boundless' expression was somewhat cold, "She is so confident!"
The mysterious woman said softly, "She is indeed very confident, but she has the strength."
Saying that, she turned to look at the horizon, "I hope that the Cause of Disaster is not so weak, otherwise … how can others play with it?"
Tree Boundless asked, "In your opinion, does the Cause of Disaster have a chance of winning?"
The mysterious woman nodded, "Yes!"
Tree Boundless asked, "Why do you think so?"
The mysterious woman said softly, "That's because the two of them weren't able to stop this Disaster Cause back then … You have to understand that whether it's the azure-clothed man or the plain-dressed woman, they can only destroy, but they can't create. This Disaster Cause is far, far too deep.
Most importantly, if the source of this Cause of Disaster is Ye Xuan himself, then this matter will be too interesting.
At that time, should she kill or not?
The reason why she hasn't forcefully cut off the Cause of Calamity on Ye Xuan is also because of this! "
Tree Boundless asked solemnly, "What do you plan to do next?"
The mysterious woman raised the teacup and took a light sip, and then she said softly, "Wait!"
Tree Boundless frowned. "How much longer do we have to wait?"
The mysterious woman smiled and said, "We've waited for so many years. There's no need to rush, right?"
Tree Boundless was silent.
The mysterious woman suddenly asked, "How's the contact?"
Tree Boundless said calmly, "Your seduction worked!
More and more people join us!
However, you have to remember one thing. If that woman or that man comes back, everything we've done will be meaningless. "
The mysterious woman nodded, "Even if that man wanted to come back, he wouldn't be able to do so immediately.
What we really need to be careful of is slaughtering them … "
Tree Boundless nodded. "As long as that woman doesn't come back."
At this point, she suddenly looked at the mysterious woman. "By the way, what level have you reached?
Why can't I sense your realm? "
The mysterious woman smiled slightly, "We're not enemies, you don't need to worry."
Tree Boundless said calmly, "I'm just curious!"
The mysterious woman smiled and said, "A little higher than you think!"
Tree Boundless frowned slightly, but she didn't ask any more questions.
At this time, the mysterious woman suddenly said, "We have to be careful of someone!"
Tree Boundless asked, "Who?"
The mysterious woman dipped her finger into the tea, and then wrote a name on the table.
Tree Boundless frowned slightly, "He's here?"
The mysterious woman nodded, "He should be here."
Tree Boundless said, "I'll deal with him!"
The mysterious woman smiled and said, "No, you have to deal with something else."
Tree Boundless looked at the mysterious woman, "Tell me your plan!"
The mysterious woman said softly, "When that woman is a little further away, when I can't sense her, we'll make the Disaster Cause on Ye Xuan materialize … At that time, besides the Three Swords, whoever helps him will suffer the wrath of Heaven!"
Tree Boundless said, "Alright!"
Saying so, she stood up and left.
The mysterious woman looked at the teacup in front of her, and after a long time, she said softly, "Even if I'm an ant trying to shake a tree, I still want to try …"
Saying so, she took out a white silk handkerchief, and on the handkerchief, there was a small footprint.
Looking at the handkerchief in her hand, a trace of pain flashed in her eyes, "Why should you die … Why?
Because he has an invincible little sister?
Don't worry, I'll make him pay the price. "
Those were her son's footprints. However, she had never even seen her son's face. That was because the calamity had descended upon her, and her soul had almost been destroyed. When she had woken up, only one of her two children was left!
No, at that time, there was another person, and that was Tian Ming!
After recalling the past, the killing intent in the mysterious woman's eyes became more and more ferocious …
...
In the Five Dimensional Universe.
Ye Xuan didn't pay attention to the outside world, and every day, he only focused on cultivating.
The current him had perfectly fused the Sword Domain and the power of faith!
The power of faith supported the Sword Domain, and the Sword Domain supported the Way of the Sword. With the perfect combination of the two powers, it could be said that his current Sword Domain was completely different from before!
Apart from that, he had also developed the Blood Domain!
The combination of bloodline power and the Blood Domain!
He found that his bloodline power could greatly increase his Blood Domain, and it could make his blood reach a qualitative change!
The most important thing in the Blood Domain was blood!
Before this, he had actually neglected this problem!
The Blood Domain, of course, needed blood!
The only pity was that he couldn't activate the Crazy Demon Bloodline, because the Crazy Demon Bloodline's destructive power was stronger than the Immortal Bloodline. If the Crazy Demon Bloodline was combined with the Blood Domain, the power of the Blood Domain would become even stronger!
Apart from that, he found that when he used the Blood Domain, the more blood there was, the stronger the Blood Domain would become!
In addition, the Death Domain needed Death Qi. A Death Domain with Death Qi and a Death Domain without Death Qi were two completely different domains. However, the power of the Death Domain couldn't be compared to the Blood Domain and the Sword Domain, because he didn't have too much Death Qi. Unless he killed too many people and used millions of yin spirits and Death Qi to stabilize the domain … However, this situation was very rare!
As for the Dark Domain, he found that the power of the Dark Domain would be greatly enhanced in the shattered space. He could use all kinds of dark matter to strengthen the Dark Domain. It should be said that when he used the Dark Domain, he could use the Dark Domain to forcibly absorb all the dark matter energy in the surroundings!
How much dark matter energy was there between heaven and earth?
Especially in the starry sky, the dark matter energy could be said to be endless!
In short, in the past month or so, Ye Xuan had gained a lot, especially in the use of the four Domains. In this aspect, he had improved a lot. Now, the four Domains were no longer useless to him, but a great killer move.
Inside the hall, Ye Xuan and An Lanxiu sat facing each other. During this period of time, An Lanxiu had always been with him, and the two of them were discussing. Moreover, he had already imparted Life Fist to An Lanxiu!
What made him a little dumbfounded was that even if An Lanxiu didn't have a powerful body, she could still cultivate the Life Fist. However, her Life Fist was different from his. Moreover, she didn't burn her lifespan!
Rather than saying that she cultivated the Life Fist, it would be better to say that she was drawing on the Life Fist.
In this aspect of the Martial Dao, An Lanxiu's talent was really too terrifying.
An Lanxiu looked at Ye Xuan, "You want to change the Life Fist into the Life Sword?"
Ye Xuan nodded, "Yes.
I had this idea a long time ago!
The Life Fist's power is extremely strong. If it can be fused with my Instant Kill Sword, then its power will definitely reach a very terrifying level! "
An Lanxiu said in a deep voice, "Difficult!"
An Lanxiu said in a deep voice, "Difficult!"
Ye Xuan smiled, "I know!"
What was the Instant Kill Sword particular about?
It was speed and that instant of explosive force!
The Life Fist was also particular about explosive force. If these two types of explosive force could be fused together, then the might would absolutely be able to destroy the heavens and the earth.
However, this was extremely difficult because the might of the Life Fist was too great, and the speed and strength of the Instant Kill Sword had reached a limit. This wasn't a combination of strength and softness, but a fusion of strength and strength. So, the difficulty wasn't ordinary.
An Lanxiu suddenly said, "However, it isn't impossible!"
Ye Xuan looked at An Lanxiu, "What do you mean?"
An Lanxiu looked at Ye Xuan, "Domain!"
Ye Xuan was stunned when he heard this, and then he suddenly came to his senses, "Right!
I can use my Domain to suppress these two forces and prevent them from going out of control! "
An Lanxiu nodded, "Your Faith Energy combined with your Sword Domain should be able to suppress the formidable strength of these two martial techniques. Moreover, your body is sufficiently strong to be able to support these two forces!
However, you have to pay attention to the problem after executing this sword strike. If you're directly paralyzed after executing this sword strike, then I feel that such a fusion wouldn't have much meaning!
Moreover, after the fusion, if the speed of execution is unable to attain the speed of the Instant Kill Sword, then it would be meaningless as well. "
Ye Xuan fell silent.
He knew what An Lanxiu meant. No matter if it was researching Domains or sword techniques, their imaginary enemy was that mysterious woman!
Simply speaking, if he were to face the mysterious woman, then he only had the chance to execute a single sword strike, and this sword strike didn't just have to be swift, it had to be strong as well!
In other words, the current speed of the Instant Kill Sword wasn't sufficient. Not only was its speed insufficient, its strength was far from sufficient. Moreover, if he were to fuse the Life Fist with the Instant Kill Sword, then even if his strength was sufficient, it would be useless if his speed wasn't sufficient!
Because he might be killed by the mysterious woman at the instant he executed his sword strike!
That woman wasn't stupid, and if she sensed danger, then she would absolutely not give him the chance to execute his sword strike!
An Lanxiu said, "You can give it a try now!"
Ye Xuan nodded, "Enter the pagoda!"
As he spoke, he and An Lanxiu entered the World Prison Pagoda.
Only by cultivating in the pagoda would he be able to satisfy that mysterious woman.
Within the World Prison Pagoda, Ye Xuan stood silently, his right hand grasping the Unparalleled Sword. His lifespan began to burn, and at the instant he did so, a powerful force suddenly condensed in his right arm …
The energy of lifespan!
Ye Xuan slowly closed his eyes, continuing to burn his lifespan. In just a moment, he had burned nearly 50 years of his lifespan, and at this moment, the sword in his hand began to tremble violently. Although he was constantly using the Sword Domain and Faith Energy to suppress it, this force was truly too strong, and he found it difficult to control.
After a long time, Ye Xuan suddenly opened his eyes and looked at An Lanxiu, "I can't use my sword!"
An Lanxiu frowned, "You can't use your sword?"
Ye Xuan nodded, his expression solemn, "The force is too strong, it has already surpassed my control."
An Lanxiu fell silent.
Ye Xuan sighed softly, feeling slightly regretful, but he didn't intend to give up. If it was so easy to fuse, then it would be too much of a joke.
Ye Xuan began to slowly release the force. He decided to make it simpler and not burn so much of his lifespan. He would do it bit by bit. Although this would consume a little of his lifespan, if he could fuse it, then it would absolutely be worth it.
While Ye Xuan was cultivating, the space on the 9th floor suddenly trembled. Ye Xuan and An Lanxiu who were cultivating suddenly raised their heads to look at the 9th floor. In the next moment, the two of them appeared on the 9th floor, and in the 9th floor, space suddenly split open and a black object floated out. When they saw this object, Ye Xuan and An Lanxiu were stunned.
.....
PS: Please praise me!
Let me be lost in your praises!







Chapter 1493
Pagoda!
In front of the two of them was a Xiao Ta. This Xiao Ta was different from the World Prison Pagoda. This Xiao Ta was emitting a purple light, and this purple light was somewhat similar to his purple aura!
Ye Xuan turned to look at An Lanxiu. Both of them had a trace of shock in their eyes.
There was a Xiao Ta in this pagoda?
What was this?
At this moment, that Xiao Ta floated in front of Ye Xuan. It bounced in front of Ye Xuan, as if it was sizing up Ye Xuan.
Ye Xuan hesitated, and asked, "You are?"
The Xiao Ta suddenly laughed, "Xiao Ta!"
Ye Xuan's mouth twitched. Damn, this Xiao Ta could speak.
Xiao Ta suddenly said, "You seem to be very confused?"
Ye Xuan sized up Xiao Ta, "You are?"
Xiao Ta laughed, "I am Xiao Ta!"
Ye Xuan's expression froze, this motherf * cker …
At this moment, Xiao Ta suddenly swayed from side to side, as if it was very happy.
Ye Xuan asked, "Xiao Ta, why are you in this pagoda?"
Xiao Ta floated in front of Ye Xuan, and said with a smile, "Master placed me here, saying that I should assist you."
Ye Xuan blinked, "Assist me?"
Xiao Ta nodded, "Yes!"
Ye Xuan was a little confused, "Who is your master?"
Xiao Ta said, "My master is my master!"
Ye Xuan held his forehead, he was having a headache.
At this moment, An Lanxiu suddenly asked, "What is your master called?"
Xiao Ta laughed, "You want to know my master's identity?"
Ye Xuan nodded, "Yes."
Xiao Ta suddenly bounced, "Is there any benefit?"
"Benefits?"
Ye Xuan and An Lanxiu were both stunned. This pagoda wanted benefits?
Xiao Ta suddenly said, "Of course there must be benefits!
Why should I tell you if I won't give you any benefits? "
Ye Xuan said solemnly, "Didn't I ask you to assist me?"
Xiao Ta stopped. "Who said that?"
Ye Xuan stared at Xiao Ta. "You said it yourself!"
Xiao Ta quickly shook his head, "No!
I never said that!
You must have heard wrong! "
Ye Xuan was dumbfounded. Damn it, this guy actually didn't want to admit it?
An Lanxiu's expression was also somewhat odd. Why was this Xiao Ta so flowery?
Ye Xuan suddenly asked, "What benefits do you want?"
Xiao Ta chuckled. "I don't know either. You decide. As long as I like it, it's fine!"
Ye Xuan thought for a moment, then said with a smile, "I feel that you definitely won't be interested in ordinary treasures, right?"
Small Tower hurriedly nodded. "Of course, you can't use trash to trick me. Let me tell you, I know several hundred ways to trick people. Trying to trick me in front of me, you will only be asking to be humiliated!"
Ye Xuan, "…"
At this moment, a sword suddenly flew in front of Ye Xuan.
Sword Spirit!
Ye Xuan was just about to speak when Sword Spirit directly slashed at Xiao Ta.
Bang!
Xiao Ta trembled violently and directly jumped out!
Ye Xuan, "…"
In the distance, Xiao Ta wailed, "Wow, Sister Sword Spirit, you're here too!"
The Sword Spirit flew back in front of Ye Xuan. Ye Xuan opened his palm and the Sword Spirit landed in his hand. In the distance, Xiao Ta was shivering.
Ye Xuan glanced at Xiao Ta. This Xiao Ta was afraid of the Sword Spirit!
Ye Xuan held his sword and walked in front of Xiao Ta. Xiao Ta hurriedly said, "You … don't mess around!
Violence is useless. Let's talk this out! "
The corner of Ye Xuan's mouth twitched. This guy was quite flexible.
Ye Xuan
He smiled and said, "I won't mess around!
Like I want to ask you some questions. Can you answer me? "
Xiao Ta was silent.
The little friend suddenly held the sword and lightly patted his palm. At this moment, Xiao Ta hurriedly said, "Master is Sister Sword Spirit's Master!"
Ye Xuan was slightly stunned. He looked at the sword in his hand and understood!
This Xiao Ta's Master was the green-robed man!
The green-robed man left for him was Xiao Ta?
Ye Xuan collected his thoughts and continued to ask, "Your Master left you for me?"
Xiao Ta nodded but quickly shook his head.
The corner of Ye Xuan's mouth twitched. "What do you mean?"
Lil 'Pagoda stuttered …
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "If you want to leave, I won't stop you!"
Xiao Ta suddenly jumped up. "Really?"
Ye Xuan nodded.
Xiao Ta turned and ran.
Ye Xuan: "…"
At this moment, a sword suddenly blocked in front of him. It was the Sword Spirit!
The Sword Spirit fiercely slashed at Xiao Ta. Xiao Ta hurriedly dodged and begged, "Sister Sword Spirit, don't hit me. Don't hit me. I won't leave!
I really won't leave!
I will be honest … "
Ye Xuan: "…"
After slashing for a long time, the Sword Spirit stopped. Xiao Ta hid in a corner and looked a little pitiful.
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "Can we have a good talk?"
Xiao Ta felt a little wronged and said, "You asked me to leave. I didn't leave on my own."
Ye Xuan shook his head and smiled. "What did your Master leave you for me to do?"
Xiao Ta said, "To help you!"
Ye Xuan frowned slightly. "To help me?"
Xiao Ta nodded. "Yes."
Ye Xuan was a little curious. "What can you help me with?"
Xiao Ta suddenly jumped up. "I can help you a lot!"
Ye Xuan asked, "For example?"
Xiao Ta was speechless.
Ye Xuan shook his head and smiled. "It seems that you are a mascot. You can play by yourself!
We are leaving! "
After saying that, he and An Lanxiu were about to leave.
At this moment, Xiao Ta suddenly trembled. In the next moment, countless purple qi appeared in the tower.
Ye Xuan was stunned. He glanced at the purple qi and was a little shocked. This purple qi was so pure!
At this moment, Xiao Ta suddenly said, "This is Primordial Purple Qi. It is only inferior to Little White's purple qi. If you use my purple qi to cultivate, your cultivation speed can increase by more than several times!
In addition, my purple qi also has a powerful recovery ability! "
Ye Xuan and An Lanxiu looked at each other. Both of their eyes were filled with shock. This purple qi was not ordinary purple qi. If they used it to cultivate, it shouldn't be difficult for them to reach the Consolidation Realm.
At this moment, Xiao Ta said again, "I still have some treasures."
Ye Xuan hurriedly asked, "What treasures?"
Xiao Ta jumped up and down. He was very proud. "Many, many treasures. Hehe."
Ye Xuan: "…"
At this moment, An Lanxiu suddenly said, "Can you take it out for me to see?"
Xiao Ta hurriedly shook his head. "I should not show my wealth. If I take it out, you will be thinking about it!"
Ye Xuan was a little speechless. "Aren't we on the same side?
Why are you still guarding against us? "
Xiao Ta said, "Even blood brothers should settle accounts clearly!"
Ye Xuan: "…"
Xiao Ta suddenly said, "Your strength is a little weak. I suggest you increase your strength. Otherwise, you will be in great danger!"
Ye Xuan frowned slightly. "Danger?"
Xiao Ta nodded. "I can feel that something bad is about to happen. You better increase your strength quickly.
Increase your strength! "
Ye Xuan fell silent. Could it be that woman is about to make a move?
During this period of time, that woman has not made a move. This is very abnormal.
At this moment, Xiao Ta suddenly said, "Can I go out and play?"
Ye Xuan glanced at Xiao Ta. Xiao Ta giggled. "I won't run around. I will come back after playing for a while!"
As he said this, an ancient book suddenly floated in front of Ye Xuan.
Ye Xuan asked, "This is?"
Xiao Ta hurriedly said, "Sword Drawing Technique. This is the Sword Drawing Technique that Master improved. Take it and cultivate!"
Sword Drawing Technique!
Ye Xuan took the ancient book. He opened it and very quickly, his expression became solemn. This Sword Drawing Technique was very different from the one that the green-clothed man gave him!
Ye Xuan kept the ancient book and looked at Xiao Ta. "Go and play!"
Xiao Ta suddenly cheered. He directly turned into a purple light and disappeared in the Prison Pagoda.
Inside the Prison Pagoda, Ye Xuan looked at the ancient book in front of him and said softly, "This Sword Skill is suitable for frontal attacks. Moreover, this Sword Skill focuses on breaking the surface with a single point … It has the meaning of 'One Sword Breaks Ten Thousand Techniques'. It can be used for both offense and defense!"
An Lanxiu said, "You should first fuse your Instant Death Sword with Life Fist!"
Ye Xuan nodded. He still wanted to fuse Life Fist with Instant Death Sword first. As for this Sword Drawing Technique, it is not that difficult to cultivate. He can temporarily take it slow.
In the following time, Ye Xuan began to study the Instant Death Sword and Life Fist. An Lanxiu did not leave and continued to help in the pagoda.
As for that Xiao Ta, Ye Xuan was particularly speechless towards this Xiao Ta. Because this Xiao Ta has already gone somewhere!
But fortunately, the Sword Spirit chased after him!
....
Northern Wilderness.
In front of the stone tablet, the Divine Envoy sat cross-legged on the ground. Behind her were Ge Yao and the others. At this moment, there are more people than before!
There are more than a hundred people. The aura of these people, including themselves, is much stronger than before.
Obviously, the long period of hibernation has caused their strength to decline. Now, their strength is slowly recovering to the peak.
At this moment, the Divine Envoy suddenly opened her eyes. A woman suddenly appeared in front of her. It is the mysterious woman from the Sacred Ground.
Seeing the mysterious woman, Ge Yao and the others behind the Divine Envoy suddenly became gloomy.
It is this woman again!
The mysterious woman looked at the Divine Envoy and said with a smile, "We meet again!"
The Divine Envoy asked, "What is it?"
The mysterious woman nodded, "I want to talk to you about a great opportunity. I wonder if you are interested?"
The Divine Envoy said, "Cooperate with you to deal with that young Ye Xuan?"
The mysterious woman said with a smile, "Smart!
You guessed it right! "
The Divine Envoy shook her head, "That young man is not simple. The people behind him are not simple either. We will not cooperate with you!"
The mysterious woman blinked, "Can you represent the entire Northern Wilderness?"
The Divine Envoy said, "Now I can!"
Saying so, she looked at the mysterious woman, "We will not be used by you!"
The mysterious woman said with a smile, "That is because there are not enough benefits!"
The Divine Envoy frowned, "Even if you give us benefits, we will not team up with you."
The mysterious woman smirked, "That may not be true."
Saying so, she opened her palm and a black box appeared in her hand. She opened the box. When she saw the item in the black box, her eyes suddenly narrowed, "You …"
The mysterious woman smiled and did not speak. Instead, she turned to look at the stone tablet not far away. At this moment, a voice came from the stone tablet, "We can talk."
.....







Chapter 1494
Let's talk!
Hearing the voice, the mysterious woman smiled. "Then let's talk!"
Not far away, the Holy Messenger was silent.
Her gaze was fixed on the box in the mysterious woman's hand. At this moment, her heart was like a raging storm, and she was extremely shocked.
A voice came from the stone tablet. "How did you get this item?"
The mysterious woman blinked and smiled. "I picked it up!"
The voice from the stone tablet fell silent.
Picked it up?
No one believed it.
The mysterious woman suddenly smiled. "I don't like to talk nonsense, so I'll be straightforward.
You guys help me deal with Ye Xuan. To be exact, you just need to help me stall three people. Once you stall them, this thing will be yours. "
The voice from the stone tablet said, "That young man's background is not simple!"
The mysterious woman smiled. "I'm not simple either!"
The voice was silent.
The mysterious woman smiled. "Take your time to think about it!"
Then, she turned and left.
The voice from the stone tablet suddenly said, "I agree!"
The mysterious woman smiled. "Wait for my notice!"
After saying that, she disappeared.
The Saint walked to the stone tablet and whispered, "Supreme Goddess, that young man has the Constitution of Adversity. He's not simple. This …"
The voice from the stone tablet said again, "That's the Black Heaven and Earth Temple … We can't refuse her!"
The Saint fell silent.
The Black Heaven and Earth Temple!
The number one treasure of the prehistoric era!
The true number one treasure came from before the birth of this universe. It was an artifact but not an artifact. It existed forever and was indestructible.
There were six ancient characters inside: Dao, Life, Death, Kindness, Evil, and Calamity.
Apart from that, the number one treasure of the Northern Wilderness Tribe, the Northern Wilderness Martial Scripture, came from the Black Heaven and Earth Temple.
There were countless secrets in the Black Heaven and Earth Temple!
The Black Heaven and Earth Temple might contain an unknown era's inheritance, civilization, and treasures.
The Black Heaven and Earth Temple used to be in the hands of the Northern Wilderness Tribe. But then, the prehistoric era changed and the item disappeared.
But now, it had appeared again!
The Saint asked softly, "Why is that item in her hands?"
The Supreme Goddess said, "I don't know.
However, based on the current situation, she probably doesn't know exactly what this item is. Otherwise, she would definitely not use this item to make a trade. "
The Saint Envoy said in a low voice, "Exalted Deity, it's not normal for this woman to have this item.
Moreover, that young man, Ye Xuan, has a special background. If our clan becomes enemies with him, then I'm afraid we'll be tainted with some bad karma, and it might even bring about a calamity to our clan. "
The supreme deity in the stone tablet was silent.
The Divine Envoy continued, "The Temple of Heaven and Earth is naturally important to our tribe. However, have you ever thought about how powerful and intelligent this woman is? She is trying to sow discord and use all kinds of tricks to make us become enemies with that Young Master Ye. What does this mean?
It meant that she was afraid of the person behind that young man!
I've also investigated this person. There's an extremely powerful expert following her, and there are also several mysterious women behind her. These people are not simple! "
Then, she looked at the stone tablet. "This woman wants us to be cannon fodder!"
Inside the stone tablet, the Great Deity suddenly said, "I want to see this person!"
The Divine Envoy said, "Should I invite him?"
The Exalted Deity said, "There's no need, I'll meet him personally!"
The Divine Envoy was stunned for a moment before nodding. "Alright!"
...
Sacred Ground, inside the bamboo house.
After the mysterious woman returned to the bamboo house, she placed the black box on the bamboo table.
In front of the mysterious woman was Tree Boundless.
Tree Boundless looked at the black box. "Does the Northern Wilderness care about this box?"
The mysterious woman smiled. "They care about the item inside the box!"
Tree Boundless asked, "What is it?"
The mysterious woman smiled. "A very ancient item!"
Tree Boundless looked at the mysterious woman. "You're not interested?"
The mysterious woman shook her head. "At my level, other treasures or martial arts inheritances are no longer attractive to me."
Tree Boundless looked at the black box curiously. "How did you get this item?"
The mysterious woman smiled. "That little white guy touched it and I traded it for two candied haws!"
Hearing that, Tree Boundless' expression turned strange.
That little white guy!
Of course, she knew who the mysterious woman was talking about!
She knew that the little white guy was playful and gluttonous, but she did not expect that he would sell such a precious item for two candied haws!
What a wastrel!
Tree Boundless shook his head.
Suddenly, the mysterious woman said, "I'm going out for a while!"
Tree Boundless looked at the mysterious woman. "Are you going to make a move?"
The mysterious woman shook her head. "Wait until that woman is far away!"
Tree Boundless nodded. "That's true!"
If that woman came back, everything they had done would be for naught!
No one could stop that woman head-on!
As if thinking of something, Tree Boundless suddenly asked, "Ye Xuan seems to be cultivating!"
The mysterious woman smiled. "Let him cultivate!
After all, we don't have much time left. "
She put away the black box and left.
Tree Boundless suddenly asked, "Do you look down on him that much?"
The mysterious woman stopped and shook her head. "It's not that I look down on him. On the contrary, I admire him. Among my peers, there are not many who can compare to him.
But we are from the same generation as his father. If we can't even beat him, then we have lived all these years in vain. "
Having said that, she opened the bamboo door and walked out.
Inside the hall, Tree Boundless was silent.
That era!
At that moment, she thought of that woman again!
That woman in a plain dress!
That woman who had suppressed countless eras. In front of that woman, countless giants of the past paled in fear!
...
In the Five-Dimensional Universe.
Inside the World Prison Pagoda, Ye Xuan sat on the ninth floor. His eyes were closed, and his sword domain enveloped the entire World Prison Pagoda. In front of him was the Unparalleled Sword!
After an unknown amount of time, Ye Xuan once again grasped the Unparalleled Sword.
Bang!
A powerful force suddenly shook the pagoda, causing the surrounding walls to tremble.
Ye Xuan tightly gripped the Unparalleled Sword. Within his right hand was an endless amount of lifespan.
This time, he burned 50 years of his lifespan!
Ye Xuan stared at the Unparalleled Sword in his hand. Although the sword domain was suppressing him, the power contained within the sword was too great. At this moment, the ninth floor was shaking violently. If not for the dao laws suppressing him, this pagoda would not have been able to withstand his current strength.
His current strength was already a bit abnormal.
On the side, An Lanxiu looked at Ye Xuan, "Can you use the sword?"
Ye Xuan nodded, "I can now!"
As he spoke, he slowly raised the Unparalleled Sword. This sword, he could swing it!
However, the speed was not enough!
The power of this sword far exceeded the power of the Instant Death Sword. It could be said to be several times more powerful. However, the speed was definitely not as fast as the Instant Death Sword!
At this moment …
An Lanxiu suddenly said, "There are pros and cons!"
Ye Xuan nodded. The power and speed of the Instant Death Sword had actually reached the limit of his physical body. If the Instant Death Sword fused with his Life Fist, unless his physical body reached the God Realm, it would be very difficult for him to increase his speed!
Ye Xuan sighed softly and began to slowly release the power within the sword.
During this period of time, in order to fuse the Life Fist with the Instant Death Sword, he had burned more than 200 years of his lifespan. However, he still could not achieve his ideal state!
This was because the Unparalleled Sword could no longer increase his speed. This meant that he had truly reached his own limit.
On the other hand, without that speed, this sword of his would absolutely not be able to pose any threat to that woman!
She wouldn't just stand there and let him slash her!
Meanwhile, An Lanxiu spoke in a light voice, "Just do your best!"
Ye Xuan gazed at An Lanxiu and smiled, "Right!
Just do your best!
If you really can't defeat her, then it can't be helped. "
An Lanxiu nodded. "This sword of yours has no chance of winning against that woman. However, there aren't many in this world that can withstand this sword of yours."
The might of the Life Fist combined with the Instant Death Sword was extraordinarily terrifying when two explosive martial techniques were fused.
Ye Xuan nodded. He glanced at the Unparalleled Sword in his hand and said, "This new sword technique shall be called the Life Sword!"
The Life Sword!
A sword strike that burned one's lifespan!
Ye Xuan put the Unparalleled Sword away, and then he withdrew the ancient scroll that Xiao Ta had given him.
The Sword Drawing Technique!
Ye Xuan flipped open the scroll, and he gazed at it for a long time before he spoke in a light voice, "What an amazing Sword Drawing Technique!"
An Lanxiu walked over to Ye Xuan, glanced at it, and said softly, "It really is extraordinary!"
Ye Xuan shook his head and laughed bitterly. "I think I need to consolidate my strength for a while!
I've been busy dealing with those enemies every single day, and I've neglected my own Sword Dao! "
His Sword Dao hadn't improved in a very, very long time!
His improvement was mainly in the aspect of his body, and he'd relied on external forces to improve his body. As for his Sword Dao, it had stagnated for a very long time.
Moreover, no one could help him in his future path of the Sword Dao. Because he'd already walked his own path, and what he had to do now was continue walking down it and not stay where he was!
At this moment, he recalled what the white robed Qing 'er had said!
The Unrestrained Sword Heart!
Actually, he'd always been unable to truly attain the Unrestrained Sword Heart because there were truly too many restraints in his heart!
In the beginning, it was only Ling 'er, then it was Big Sister Nian, and now it was the entire Fifth Dimension!
There were more and more restraints, and they were the kind that couldn't be cut off.
As for the Swordsman's sword, the fewer restraints there were, the faster and sharper his sword would be!
As he thought of this, Ye Xuan's brows suddenly furrowed.
Was this really the case?
A person must have faith in life.
What was his faith?
It was to protect the people by his side!
Responsibility!
If a man couldn't shoulder his responsibilities, could he still be considered a man?
Restraints?
To him, the entire Fifth Dimension was indeed a restraint, but it was also Ye Xuan's responsibility.
Since it was his responsibility, how could he talk about restraints?
Being heartless and giving up everything, could he really attain the Unrestrained Sword Heart?
Perhaps he could, but for Ye Xuan, it was impossible!
It was like a person abandoning his parents, wife, and children. This kind of person was indeed very free, because he didn't have any burdens. He was alone and free.
However, this kind of freedom wasn't what Ye Xuan wanted.
To him, what was the use of a sword?
It wasn't to seek invincibility!
Instead, it was to protect!
As he thought of this, many people suddenly appeared in Ye Xuan's mind. Ye Ling, An Lanxiu, Lian Wanli, Tuoba Yan, Xiao Qi, Xiao Dao, Aro, Mo Yunqi, Xiao Qi, everything in the Fifth Dimension … and Sister Nian …
Scenes of the past flashed through Ye Xuan's mind like lightning.
There were all kinds of ups and downs!
After a long time, Ye Xuan suddenly looked at the sword in his hand and smiled. "Qing'Er, I understand what you mean by the Unrestrained Sword Heart.
The Unrestrained Sword Heart doesn't mean abandoning everything, it doesn't mean being heartless or selfish … The Unrestrained Sword Heart means doing things with a clear conscience, being a person with a clear conscience, and being free with a clear conscience … "
As he thought of this, the Unparalleled Sword in his hand suddenly trembled, and the sword's cry never stopped.
Not only that, at this moment, all the swords in Ye Xuan's body trembled, even the sword at the top of the pagoda trembled slightly, as if responding …
...
PS: Give me a ticket if you have one!
One monthly ticket isn't much, you can't go to Singapore, one monthly ticket is nothing, anyone can afford it …







Chapter 1495
Inside the pagoda, Ye Xuan's eyes were closed.
At that moment, he had entered a very strange state.
Relaxed!
He suddenly felt extremely relaxed. This was a feeling that he had never felt before!
In the past, it was as if he had been imprisoned by shackles. There were shackles on his heart and thoughts, but now, those two shackles were gone.
His thoughts were clear, and he felt unprecedentedly relaxed!
At that moment, An Lanxiu suddenly asked, "Did you break through?"
Ye Xuan opened his eyes and smiled. "No, but I understand what true freedom is!"
As he said that, he looked at the Supreme Sword in his hand and chuckled. "Previously, I was always shackled by myself, and my sword was also shackled by me … But it won't happen in the future!"
The Supreme Sword in Ye Xuan's hand was still trembling as if it was responding.
This sword originally did not have a spirit, and it was just a sword. Of course, this sword was very special. After all, it came from the Milky Way Realm.
But now, this sword had a spirit of its own!
Ye Xuan had bestowed it with a spirit of its own!
The sword was extraordinary because of its master!
The current Ye Xuan already had the ability to change the sword.
The breakthrough in his state of mind made Ye Xuan look different. Previously, he was like a sword shackled by a scabbard. Although he was reserved, his hands and feet were tied, and he did not have the kind of momentum that could destroy thousands of enemies with one sword.
But now, he was like an unsheathed sword. Not only did he show off his sharpness, but he also had a domineering sword aura that made people feel intimidated.
At that moment, An Lanxiu felt that Ye Xuan was a Swordsman!
In fact, although Ye Xuan was a Swordsman, his combat strength was previously dependent on the power of his bloodline, his physical body, and the power of faith. It could be said that the reason why his combat strength was so strong was not because of his Sword Dao.
Apart from these few things, his combat strength was really not that great. Especially when he did not have a Dao Body, his combat strength could be said to be greatly reduced.
Could he easily kill a Godly State powerhouse by relying on Sword Dao alone?
Of course not!
Moreover, without the Dao Physique, he could at most fight one or two God State experts, but if he had the Dao Physique, even 10 God State experts wouldn't be able to do anything to him!
Rather than a Swordsman, it would be more accurate to say that he was a Physique Cultivator.
Moreover, even though he'd taken a new path in the Dao of the Sword, he hadn't taken it well. Because he hadn't gone far on this new path, and he'd remained stagnant.
Now that he was enlightened, he was finally like a real Swordsman!
Confidence in the way of the sword!
Of course, this was only the beginning!
Ye Xuan looked at the supreme sword in his hand and said with a smile, "This feeling is very wonderful!
It's like the feeling when I first learned the sword! "
An Lanxiu suddenly said, "Congratulations!"
Ye Xuan shook his head and smiled. "My path of the Sword Dao is still very long!"
Although his mental state had broken through, he couldn't be arrogant at all!
Why?
Because there were too many formidable Swordsman by his side!
Not to mention Qing 'er and the green clothed man, he couldn't even compare to Ting Yun now. There was also Big Sister Nian, and Big Sister Nian was a formidable Swordsman as well!
An Lanxiu suddenly said, "Try executing the Instakill Sword now!"
Ye Xuan looked at An Lanxiu. "Let's go somewhere else!"
An Lanxiu nodded.
Both of them directly vanished within the pagoda, and it wasn't long before they arrived in a deathly silent starry sky.
The two of them were 300m apart!
Ye Xuan looked at An Lanxiu. "Watch out!"
At the instant he finished speaking, a strand of sword light suddenly arrived between An Lanxiu's brows.
However, a spear had suddenly been pressed against Ye Xuan's chest.
In the distance, An Lanxiu shook her head. "I've lost!"
She was unable to resist this strike of Ye Xuan's. Even though her spear was extremely swift, but Ye Xuan had an advantage over her.
Xuan had an advantage over her, and that was her Daoist physique.
Ye Xuan's sword was able to kill her, but her spear was unable to kill Ye Xuan.
Compared to before, Ye Xuan's sword had already undergone a tremendous change. If he utilized external forces like the energy of faith, then she would be even more unable to fight him.
Ye Xuan looked at the sword in his hand. His current Instakill Sword was too much faster than before. Most importantly, its might was much stronger than before as well!
The breakthrough in his mental state this time had brought about a tremendous change to his Sword Dao.
At this moment, he finally felt that he was a Swordsman and not a body refiner.
As if he'd thought of something, Ye Xuan suddenly looked at An Lanxiu. "I'll defend if you attack me!"
As he spoke, he took out a sword sheath and placed the Supreme Sword into it.
An Lanxiu understood what Ye Xuan meant, and she immediately nodded. "Alright!"
As soon as she finished speaking, she suddenly vanished on the spot, and a speck of cold light appeared in front of Ye Xuan.
Ye Xuan suddenly drew his sword and slashed!
Sword Drawing Technique!
An expanse of sword light suddenly erupted in front of Ye Xuan, and that speck of cold light was instantly drowned out by this expanse of sword light. But in the next moment, that expanse of sword light was directly shattered.
Bang!
Ye Xuan directly retreated explosively by 300m!
After he stopped, Ye Xuan looked at An Lanxiu. His Sword Drawing Technique utilized a single point to break through, whereas, An Lanxiu's spear strike utilized a single point to break through, and he hadn't gone all out!
Ye Xuan looked at An Lanxiu. "Again!"
An Lanxiu nodded, and then she tapped the tip of her foot lightly. In the next moment, an afterimage flashed to arrive before Ye Xuan.
Ye Xuan held the hilt of his sword with his right hand, and then he suddenly drew it.
Om!
A sword howl shook the heavens and the earth!
His sword descended!
Rumble!
Along with an explosion, Ye Xuan's sword light was directly shattered. This time, Ye Xuan retreated by over 1km.
After he stopped, Ye Xuan gazed at the sword in his hand and went silent.
An Lanxiu didn't attack again.
After a long time, Ye Xuan said in a low voice, "I know what the problem is!
Imposing aura! "
As he spoke, his eyes slowly closed.
Imposing aura!
A person's imposing aura was extremely important, and his Sword Drawing Technique lacked precisely such an imposing aura.
In the past, he'd seen the green clothed man execute this sword technique, and that time was in the world below.
When the green clothed man executed this sword technique, that strike seemed as if it intended to slash the heavens apart.
When he thought of imposing aura, he thought of Qing 'er's Life and Death Decided with a Single Strike!
Death is inevitable with this strike of mine!
This sort of imposing aura was what he lacked the most.
When he thought up to here, Ye Xuan looked at An Lanxiu. But in next to no time, he became slightly helpless!
He wanted to be more ruthless, but how could he be ruthless towards An Lanxiu?
Should I slash him to death with this strike of mine?
Towards An Lanxiu, he seriously couldn't do it!
Actually, An Lanxiu didn't have that sort of killing aura when she attacked him with her spear either. On the contrary, she still held back strength and didn't dare to use her full strength!
Two people sparring had advantages and disadvantages!
Seeming to have thought of something, Ye Xuan suddenly said, "Come, I'll bring you to find someone!"
Finished talking, he directly brought An Lanxiu along and vanished in the starry sky.
Before long, the two people arrived at the Dao Door again.
The person who received Ye Xuan and An Lanxiu was an old man. When he saw Ye Xuan, that old man had a slight headache because the person who received Ye Xuan the last time was him.
Ye Xuan looked at the old man and said with a smile, "Please inform Third Miss that I have something to look for her about!"
The old man hesitated and was just about to speak when Ye Xuan suddenly said, "You want to say that Third Miss isn't here, right?"
The old man was speechless.
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "Go tell Third Miss that I'm here.
Ye Xuan won't make it difficult for her! "
The old man was still hesitant. Right at this moment, a woman suddenly appeared in front of Ye Xuan and An Lanxiu.
It was the Third Miss!
The Third Miss looked at Ye Xuan, "How annoying!"
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "Third Miss, I trust you've been well since we last met!"
The Third Miss said indifferently, "Is something the matter?"
Ye Xuan cupped his fists and said, "I hope Third Miss can help me with something!"
The Third Miss said, "What is it?"
Ye Xuan said, "Hit me!"
An Lanxiu was very strong, but she couldn't bring herself to be ruthless, and he similarly couldn't bring himself to be ruthless towards An Lanxiu. Moreover, if both of them showed mercy during sparring, then what was the point of sparring?
So he wanted to find someone who could beat him up. Only in this way would he be able to find out where he was lacking.
The Third Miss looked at Ye Xuan, "You want to spar with me?"
Ye Xuan nodded, "Yes."
The Third Miss was silent.
Ye Xuan asked, "Can I?"
The Third Miss glanced at Ye Xuan, "Why do you suddenly want to spar with me?"
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "I just want to improve myself."
The Third Miss nodded, "Okay!"
Ye Xuan blinked, "You agree?"
The Third Miss said, "Spar with me!
Come with me! "
Saying that, she turned and left.
Ye Xuan hesitated for a moment, then followed the Third Miss.
Soon, the Third Miss brought Ye Xuan to an empty square. Around this square, there were all kinds of array formations stabilizing the space.
The Third Miss looked at Ye Xuan, "How do you want to spar?"
Ye Xuan said, "Hit me!
I … "
Before he could finish his words, the distant Third Young Lady suddenly disappeared.
Before Ye Xuan could react, he felt a sharp pain in his abdomen. Then, his whole body flew backward and finally hit the space barrier. The entire trial square suddenly shook violently.
An Lanxiu, "…"
In the distance, Ye Xuan looked a little pained because he felt like his body was falling apart!
When did his Dao body become so weak?
At this moment, the Third Miss suddenly appeared in front of him. Ye Xuan was stunned. He was about to speak when the Third Miss suddenly punched his head.
Bang!
Ye Xuan's whole body directly hit the ground and slid hundreds of feet away. The moment he stopped, he felt dizzy as if he was going to faint.
At this moment, the Third Miss suddenly appeared in front of him again. Before he could react, the Third Miss directly grabbed one of his legs and lifted him up. Then, she slammed him into the ground.
Boom!
The ground directly collapsed, turning into a huge pit.
But it was not over yet. The Third Miss suddenly kicked Ye Xuan's abdomen.
Bang!
Ye Xuan instantly flew more than 100 feet away. Before he landed, the Third Miss appeared in front of him again and then flew up and kicked him in the abdomen.
Bang!
Ye Xuan directly flew out and hit the space barrier in the distance.
Boom!
The surrounding space barrier directly cracked …
As soon as Ye Xuan stopped, the Third Miss appeared in front of him again. Then, she directly grabbed one of Ye Xuan's legs and slammed it on the ground …
Bang bang bang bang!
Deep pits directly appeared in the surrounding ground …
At this moment, Ye Xuan suddenly wailed, "Stop … Stop …"
The Third Miss said while hitting him, "What?
Don't stop?
Use force?
Okay, I will use force! "
Bang bang bang bang …
Ye Xuan, "…"
..







Chapter 1496
Just like that, Ye Xuan was beaten for nearly half an hour before he stopped!
During this period, Ye Xuan tried to resist!
But it was useless!
The more he resisted, the worse he was beaten!
Every time he wanted to use his sword, it was useless, because as soon as the sword appeared, he would be beaten even worse.
The main reason was that he was beaten silly from the beginning!
And his dao body seemed to be useless in front of the third young lady.
After the third young lady stopped, she walked to the side, the corners of her mouth slightly raised, it was really comfortable!
In fact, she had wanted to beat this guy for a long time!
But there was no chance!
But she didn't expect that this guy would come to her and ask her to beat him …
How could she refuse such a good thing?
In the distance, Ye Xuan climbed up and looked at the third young lady in the distance. The third young lady turned to look at Ye Xuan and said seriously, "How do you feel?"
Ye Xuan's face was full of black lines, "Third young lady, did you just want to beat me?"
The third young lady sneered, "You actually thought that I just wanted to beat you!"
Ye Xuan glanced at the third young lady, "Isn't that the case?"
The third young lady walked in front of Ye Xuan, "Of course not, the reason why I beat you was to let you understand your current shortcomings!
Moreover, you asked me to beat you, you asked me to! "
Saying that, she pointed to the distant An Lanxiu, "She can testify!"
An Lanxiu, "…"
Ye Xuan shook his head, he had fallen for this woman's trick!
The third young lady suddenly said, "What do you think now?"
Ye Xuan said lightly, "My thought is to be careful of women!"
The third young lady, "…"
As if thinking of something, Ye Xuan suddenly said, "Third young lady, why is my dao body so vulnerable in front of you?"
The third young lady smiled, "Because I also cultivate dao body!
And let me tell you, dao body doesn't mean invincible, when a person is too strong, they can directly destroy your body.
Of course, your physical body is a little special because you have a powerful bloodline. The recovery ability of your bloodline is too abnormal! "
Although Ye Xuan had just been beaten up, his body had more or less recovered, which made her rather depressed!
"Third Young Lady, how strong are you?" Ye Xuan asked in a deep voice.
He suddenly realized that the woman in front of him was much, much stronger than he had imagined.
Even though he hadn't truly fought with his life on the line just now, and he would still be able to fight back if he utilized the Sword Domain and Faith Energy. However, he noticed that the three of them hadn't attacked him with the intent to kill. Moreover, he wanted to see if he could resist them without utilizing external forces. The outcome was that he couldn't.
The Third Young Lady laughed, "I'm not that strong. I just started cultivating earlier than you."
Ye Xuan shook his head. "You're too humble."
The Third Young Lady smiled, "Unless you have invincible strength, you have to be humble. Being humble will help you live longer!"
Ye Xuan said solemnly, "Sister Nian said the same thing!"
The Third Young Lady laughed, "Fifth Dimension Tendo?"
Ye Xuan nodded his head.
The Third Young Lady whispered, "She is an amazing person!"
Ye Xuan smiled, "You know Sister Nian?"
The Third Young Lady nodded, "I have investigated her!
She is a person of faith!
And she was willing to seal her strength for your Fifth Dimension … She is worthy of respect!
Of course, you are also not bad. At least she didn't misjudge you. "
Ye Xuan smiled and then said, "Third Young Lady, to be honest, there is one thing that I don't understand. You, Dao Laoer, and Dao Laoer are all disciples of the Taoist Sect's Grand Ancestor. So why is there such a big gap between you?"
He discovered that.
The difference in IQ between Second Young Dao and the Third Young Lady was like heaven and earth.
The Third Young Lady shook her head, "Second Senior Brother was also very outstanding. He was able to use Master's Dao Scripture to create the Dark Scripture, which proved his talent.
It was power that harmed him!
After Master left, the Dao Faction was like a group of dragons without a leader. At that time, the Dao Faction was the number one force in the universe. Second Senior Brother and Eldest Senior Brother were fighting for the position of Dao Faction's Master. Therefore, the two of them directly fought for this position and the Great Dao Spirit.
Unfortunately, the Great Dao Spirit did not choose either of them … "
At this point, she sighed, "At that time, I should have stood up. If I had fought, they would not have been able to compete with me. But I really have no interest in the position of Dao Faction's Master!"
Ye Xuan shook his head and smiled, "Third Young Lady, you have no interest in the position of Dao Faction's Master, but in the end, you became the Dao Faction's Master. This life …"
The Third Young Lady laughed, "Young Master Ye, you also don't seem to have any interest in the Master of the Fifth Dimension!"
Ye Xuan nodded, "However, I will not let go of the Fifth Dimension."
The Third Young Lady chuckled, "This is where I am inferior to you!
I was a little selfish at that time!
I only wanted to live according to my own ideas. Although this is not wrong, I should not let go of the responsibility that I should bear. "
Ye Xuan suddenly asked, "Do you have an Eldest Senior Brother?"
The Third Young Lady nodded, "I contacted him. He is no longer interested in the position of Dao Faction's Master!"
Ye Xuan said in a deep voice, "Third Young Lady, you are so strong, but you still can't beat that woman?"
The Third Young Lady looked at Ye Xuan, "You know?"
Ye Xuan nodded, "I know!"
The Third Young Lady chuckled, "The reason why you think I am strong now is because you are still a little weak!
Remember, in this world, there is no strongest, only stronger! "
Ye Xuan said, "I want to kill her!"
The Third Young Lady stared at Ye Xuan, "Are you serious?"
Ye Xuan nodded.
The Third Young Lady fell into silence.
Ye Xuan said, "Do you think it's impossible?"
The Third Young Lady said softly, "Young Master Ye, you are a genius. Among the younger generation, there are very few who are better than you.
But do you know who you are going to face?
She is not from the same generation as you!
She has cultivated for tens of thousands of years more than you!
Do you know how difficult it is to jump levels and challenge her? "
Ye Xuan smiled, "But I can't just wait for death, right?"
The Third Young Lady nodded, "Indeed."
Saying that, she sighed softly, "Forget it!
I don't need to worry about the matters between you two.
Since you came to me to spar, let's start now! "
Ye Xuan cupped his fists, "Thank you!"
The Third Young Lady looked at Ye Xuan, "Make your move against me!"
Ye Xuan said in a deep voice, "Third Young Lady, I will do my best!"
The Third Young Lady smiled, "Come on!
Don't worry, I won't be careless. "
Ye Xuan nodded. The next moment, he suddenly struck with his sword.
Instant Kill!
This sword was fast to the extreme, but it was still caught by two fingers!
The Third Young Lady held onto Ye Xuan's sword and smiled, "Your swordsmanship realm has broken through!"
Ye Xuan nodded, "But it doesn't seem to work!"
The Third Young Lady shook her head, "No!"
As she spoke, she loosened two of her fingers. On her two fingers, there were two traces of blood!
The Third Young Lady looked at Ye Xuan, "If it was before, this sword of yours would not be a threat to me at all!
But now, your sword can hurt me!
You should know that I have a God State Daoist body!
If it was someone else, this sword of yours would be enough to kill them. "
Ye Xuan was relieved. He almost forgot that the Third Young Lady had a God State Daoist body!
He also had a Daoist body, so he knew how terrifying it was!
The Third Young Lady suddenly said, "You are more like a Swordsman now!
You!
Now, your sword does not have so many external enhancements, so it is more pure. This is a good thing. "
Ye Xuan said in a low voice, "How can this sword of mine be a threat to you?"
The Third Young Lady looked at Ye Xuan, "Your speed must be at least five times faster, and your strength must be at least ten times stronger. Only then can you kill me with one strike. You cannot do without either!
You have the speed, but not the strength. My Daoist body can defend against this sword of yours. You have the strength, but not the speed. I can escape before you strike, or I can strike first. "
Ye Xuan said softly, "I understand!"
The Third Young Lady said, "Now, you can use your external strength to enhance your swordsmanship."
Ye Xuan shook his head, "No need!"
Saying that, he suddenly took a step forward, and the Sword Domain enveloped the Third Young Lady. The next moment, a ray of sword light flashed through the Sword Domain.
The Third Young Lady suddenly punched!
Boom!
As soon as she punched, the ray of sword light was stopped by her punch!
Inside the ray of sword light was Ye Xuan's sword!
However, Ye Xuan's sword stabbed into the Third Young Lady's fist by half an inch!
The Third Young Lady suddenly withdrew her fist, but in the next moment, she punched again.
Boom!
The ray of sword light shattered, and the moment it shattered, a sword silently arrived between the Third Young Lady's eyebrows. However, the sword stopped half an inch away from her eyebrows!
Because the Third Young Lady had unknowingly grabbed the sword in the ray of sword light!
At this moment, in the distance, Ye Xuan suddenly opened his palm. In an instant, countless rays of sword light crisscrossed and tore through the Sword Domain.
Chi chi chi chi!
Tearing sounds resounded, and it made one's scalp go numb!
The Third Young Lady slowly closed her eyes. When the sword qi arrived in front of her, she suddenly clenched her right hand, and a powerful fist force suddenly swept out from her body.
Life Fist!
Without burning one's lifespan, it was just the fist force of Life Fist. However, this fist force directly crushed all of Ye Xuan's sword qi. Not only that, but the Sword Domain was also trembling, and it was almost unable to withstand this force.
However, there were several sword wounds all over her body.
Ye Xuan's sword could already break through her defense, but it was not enough because it was not fatal!
The Third Young Lady looked at Ye Xuan, slowly loosened her right hand, and then said, "Continue!"
After a moment of silence, Ye Xuan suddenly opened his palm, and the Supreme Sword appeared in his hand. In the next moment, he directly appeared in front of the Third Young Lady, and suddenly pulled out the sword and slashed down!
Sword-Drawing Technique!
As the sword slashed out, a powerful force swept down from the top of the Third Young Lady's head …
The Third Young Lady suddenly clenched her right hand, and a powerful fist force surged out from her right hand.
Boom!
Ye Xuan was directly shaken back!
However, in the next moment, Ye Xuan rushed out again.
In this way, in the following time, Ye Xuan madly sparred with the Third Young Lady every day, practicing the Instant Kill Sword and the Sword-Drawing Technique.
As for Life Fist, he could not practice it because to obtain the power of life, he had to burn his lifespan, and he really could not afford to practice it!
Under the crazy practice, the power of Ye Xuan's Instant Kill Sword and the Sword-Drawing Technique also became stronger and stronger …
This also made Ye Xuan understand that there was no limit, only a higher limit!
...
As for An Lanxiu, she was no longer in the Dao Sect, and she had come to an unknown starry sky.
In her hand was the map that Ye Xuan gave her!
Looking for Miss Ding!
Ye Xuan knew that if he went to look for her, the mysterious woman would definitely know. Therefore, he cultivated hard in the Dao Sect to attract attention, and secretly asked An Lanxiu to look for Miss Ding …
....







Chapter 1497
An Lanxiu was flying through the starry sky.
She knew a little about that mysterious woman from the Hallowed Grounds, Dao Yi, and she was absolutely the strongest enemy Ye Xuan had encountered so far.
Just as the Third Young Miss had said, the current Ye Xuan couldn't resist that mysterious woman at all!
She and Ye Xuan weren't from the same generation at all!
Moreover, Ye Xuan's only bloodline that could pose a slight threat to her had been sealed and suppressed by her. Most importantly, that woman wasn't alone!
She was even forming alliances!
What the hell was she doing!?
Ye Xuan naturally wouldn't resign himself to death.
That woman didn't stop him from cultivating, but she stopped him from looking for Miss Ding. Obviously, that woman was rather afraid of Miss Ding.
This time, An Lanxiu wasn't going alone. Instead, she was bringing Xiao Ta and the Sword Spirit along.
Because Xiao Ta was able to conceal An Lanxiu's aura, and the Sword Spirit was naturally there to restrain the gaudy Xiao Ta. Without the Sword Spirit, Xiao Ta would ascend to the heavens!
An Lanxiu suddenly stopped and opened the map that Ye Xuan had given her. After a long time, she transformed into a ray of light and vanished into the starry sky.
...
After the mysterious woman left the Hallowed Grounds, she arrived in the starry sky, and then she waved her fair hand lightly. The starry sky in front of her was directly torn open, and she walked into the spatial rift. In the next moment, she appeared in an unknown starry sky.
She didn't stop, and she continued tearing open the starry sky and leaping through space.
Just like that, she stopped after around four hours. At this moment, she was in a deathly silent starry sky.
There wasn't any aura of life in this starry sky. Moreover, there was a putrid smell everywhere, and it was nauseating.
The mysterious woman casually waved her hand, and the putrid smell in the surroundings vanished without a trace. She glanced at the surroundings, and then she transformed into a ray of light and entered a deathly silent starry sky!
When she entered the planet, she frowned slightly because this planet was filled with an aura of death and decay. Not only that, but there were also rotting corpses everywhere she looked.
The woman in the plain dress floated into the distance. Not long after, she arrived before an ancient city. When she approached the ancient city, a nauseating smell of decay rushed towards her like a tidal wave. There was also the smell of blood mixed in this rotten smell.
The mysterious woman looked at the city. The city was filled with densely packed corpses. These corpses had been dead for a long time, but they were all soaked in blood. The blood contained a mysterious power, and it was this mysterious power that allowed these corpses to be preserved.
There were at least several million corpses in the entire city!
This place was simply a living hell.
The mysterious woman spoke softly, "The stronger some people are, the lower their limits are!"
As she spoke, she pressed her fingers together and gestured lightly. A black coffin floated up slowly from within the city. At the very least, the coffin was covered in countless blood red talismans, and it seemed rather strange.
Right at this moment, the coffin suddenly started trembling. A moment later, a savage voice resounded from within it, "Who dares to disturb my cultivation? Are you tired of living?"
As soon as the voice resounded, a ray of blood red light suddenly surged out from within the coffin, and then it shot violently towards the mysterious woman.
The mysterious woman waved her hand.
Bang!
The ray of blood red light was instantly blasted apart!
At the same time, a mysterious force blasted against the coffin.
Bang!
The coffin instantly shattered apart, and then a man appeared in midair. The man's hair was disheveled, his body was emaciated, and his entire body emanated an extremely unpleasant and rotten smell.
The man stared fixedly at the mysterious woman, "Who are you!?"
The mysterious woman had an emotionless expression on her face, "I'll give you a fortune. Do you want it?"
The man laughed coldly, "Give me a fortune?
How arrogant of you! "
The mysterious woman suddenly spread open her right hand, and then she stretched it forward and pressed it down.
Bang!
In the distance, the man directly smashed down from the sky, and a huge crater appeared on the ground!
On the ground, the man looked at the mysterious woman in the distance. At this moment, his eyes became slightly solemn, "Who the hell are you!?"
The mysterious woman's face was expressionless, "You're the Immortal Emperor, right?"
The man stood up slowly and stared at the mysterious woman, "Who the hell are you!?"
The mysterious woman smiled, "You slaughtered all the living beings here to make use of the aura of death within their bodies to strengthen yourself, so that you can reach the Godly State and control the boundless aura of death, right?"
The man clenched his right hand slowly, "So what if I am?"
The mysterious woman looked at the man, "Now, I'll give you a chance to help you reach the Godly State!"
The man narrowed his eyes slightly, "Help me reach the Godly State?"
The mysterious woman smiled, "Yes."
The man sneered, "Do you have the ability to do that?"
The mysterious woman suddenly slapped him.
The man's pupils constricted, and he threw a punch forward.
Bang!
With a punch, the man was sent flying. When he slammed into the city wall behind him, the ancient city instantly turned into nothingness, and the man's body split open, revealing his internal organs!
The man gulped, and he raised his head to look at the mysterious woman in the distance. At this moment, his eyes were no longer solemn, but fearful!
He knew that the woman's strength was far beyond his!
The mysterious woman said, "Do you believe me now?"
The man said in a deep voice, "Who the hell are you!?"
The mysterious woman shook her head, "Don't ask these meaningless questions. You should ask what I want you to do!"
The man looked at the mysterious woman, "What do you want me to do!?"
The mysterious woman smiled, "You're too weak now!
You can't do anything! "
As she spoke, she opened her palm, and an ancient scroll appeared in front of the man, "This can help you reach the Godly State, and there's a map in it. Once you reach the Godly State, look for me immediately!
I'll give you ten days, it should be enough! "
The man opened the scroll and glanced at it. Gradually, his expression became extremely solemn.
After a while, the man looked at the mysterious woman, "S-Senior, what do you want me to do!?"
The mysterious woman smiled, "When the time comes, I'll let you do something to restrain some people. Of course, you might have to pay with your life, or you might not have to do anything.
So, you can choose now. If you're not willing, I won't force you. If you're willing, I'll help you reach the Godly State! "
The man said, "I'm willing!"
The mysterious woman smiled, "Won't you consider it?"
The Undying Emperor looked at the woman, "There's no need to consider it!
If I don't break through, I won't be able to live for long! "
The mysterious woman looked at the Undying Emperor and smiled, "Indeed!"
As she spoke, she looked around, "I don't like this place, I'm leaving!"
Then, she turned around and left.
The Undying Emperor suddenly said, "Aren't you afraid that I won't look for you after I reach the Godly State?"
The mysterious woman didn't even turn her head, "You can try!"
As she spoke, she disappeared into the horizon.
The Undying Emperor remained silent, no one knew what he was thinking.
...
Taoism.
In the training field, Ye Xuan sat with his legs crossed, recalling the scene of him sparring with the Third Lady.
He was thinking about his own shortcomings!
He had to admit that he had learned a lot from sparring with the Third Lady. Not only had his Instakill Sword Technique and Sword-Drawing Technique improved greatly, he had also gained new insights into his Life Fist.
Not far away, the Third Lady glanced at Ye Xuan. In fact, she was a little shocked. Not long ago, Ye Xuan was not a threat to her, but now, Ye Xuan was a threat to her!
If she hadn't cultivated her Dao Body to the Godly State, it would be hard to say who would win between her and Ye Xuan.
In other words, if an ordinary Godly State expert were to fight against Ye Xuan, they would be instantly killed by Ye Xuan!
Because his sword was truly fast enough!
The reason why she could suppress Ye Xuan was because of her physical body. Her physical body was stronger than Ye Xuan's!
At this moment, Ye Xuan suddenly stood up. He opened his palm and the Supreme Sword appeared in his hand. He looked at the Third Lady in the distance and said, "Let's continue!"
As he spoke, he was about to draw his sword. At this moment, the Third Lady shook her head and said, "You have a guest!"
Ye Xuan frowned and said, "That woman?"
The Third Lady shook her head and said, "No!"
As she spoke, she looked to the right and said, "You guys talk!"
After saying that, she turned and left.
Ye Xuan looked at where the Third Lady was looking. There, the space suddenly split and a shadow floated out. The shadow was blurry and he couldn't tell whether it was a man or a woman.
Ye Xuan looked at the shadow and asked, "You are?"
The shadow said, "The Northern Wilderness!"
The voice was blurry and he couldn't tell whether it was a man or a woman.
The Northern Wilderness!
Ye Xuan was stunned and said, "What's the matter?"
The shadow said, "It's nothing, I just came to see you!"
See me!
Ye Xuan's expression became slightly strange. He glanced at the shadow and said, "I think you should know the truth of the matter.
Am I right? "
The shadow said, "That woman wants the Northern Wilderness to deal with you. What do you think about this?"
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "If I'm not wrong, she must have given you a treasure or condition that you can't refuse, right?"
The shadow said, "Yes."
Ye Xuan thought for a moment and said, "What do you think?"
The shadow said, "I want to hear what you think!"
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "My idea is very simple. I will sit on top of the mountain and watch the tigers fight!"
The shadow didn't say anything.
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "Sit on top of the mountain and watch the tigers fight. You will always be in an invincible position. What do you think?"
The shadow said softly, "But the thing she gave me is very tempting."
Ye Xuan asked, "How tempting?"
The shadow said, "It can change the fate of the entire Northern Wilderness!"
Ye Xuan said, "Only when you are alive can you have a fate."
The shadow said softly, "But you are very weak!"
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "Can you see through that mysterious woman?"
The shadow said, "I can't!"
Ye Xuan shrugged and said, "She is my aunt, the blood kind!"
The shadow was silent.
Ye Xuan said again, "Sir, to tell you the truth, I have a dozen other aunts like her … In the end, this is our family's business … it's not good for you to get involved!
Also, what if one day my aunt thinks it through!
She won't hit me anymore!
At that time, what will you do?
At that time, it will be the two of us who will hit you.
What do you think? "
Then he paused and said, "Although my aunt has always been against me because of some things, I don't hate her at all. Because I know that there are no misunderstandings that can't be solved in a family. After all, she is my aunt!
My blood!
Blood is thicker than water! "
The shadow: "…"
.....
PS: Some readers told me to slow down the pace and write in more detail.
However, when I slowed down the pace, I was scolded!
Brothers, reading a book is like making a big sword, you can't just start with the climax of the plot!
Everything needs to be foreshadowed, which is a process. Just like in a relationship, don't you have to eat first, then watch a movie, and finally … How can you just get straight to the point!
Although this process is a bit boring, it must be done!
Without this process, how could there be such a thing … Don't you guys think that makes sense?!
Sorry, I went a bit off topic.
In the end, everyone could see that the woman in the plain dress had left and the plot had sped up.
Next, watch me, Luan, show off!
One more small request, when you scold me, can you be a bit more reserved?
My mental endurance is a bit low …







Chapter 1498
Blood is thicker than water!
The phantom was silent.
Although this Ye Xuan was bluffing, but it had to be said that what he said was reasonable!
This was other people's family matter!
If one day this pair of nephew and aunt suddenly stopped fighting and reconciled, at that time, wouldn't they really be in a bad situation?
Ye Xuan looked at the phantom, "Your Excellency, if I were you, I would choose to wait and see, not help anyone, wait until both of us are injured, then you come out to clean up the mess, isn't that perfect?"
The phantom said softly, "What you said is reasonable."
Saying that, his body gradually became illusory, obviously, he was about to leave.
Ye Xuan suddenly said, "Wait, wait!"
The phantom said, "What's the matter?"
Ye Xuan hesitated, and then said, "I heard that you are from a prehistoric civilization?"
The phantom nodded, "Yes."
Ye Xuan said, "Can I understand you?"
The phantom said, "Understand us?"
And some nodded quickly, "I heard that your cultivation method is somewhat different from ours, is that right?"
The phantom said, "It is indeed not the same, but the essence is not too different, we all obtain great strength through cultivation!"
Ye Xuan quickly asked, "Do you have a physical cultivation method?"
The phantom said, "Yes!"
Ye Xuan blinked, "Look at me, look at my physical body, do you think my physical body can still break through?"
The phantom looked at Ye Xuan, and said softly, "Your physical body is very strong, but there is still a lot of room for improvement!"
Ye Xuan quickly asked, "Do you have a way to improve my physical body again?"
The phantom nodded, "There is, but why should we help you?"
Ye Xuan thought for a moment, and then said, "What do you think of me?"
The phantom asked, "What do you mean in which aspect?"
Ye Xuan said, "All aspects."
The phantom said, "Glib, flowery, not what you mean …"
Ye Xuan suddenly said, "Stop, stop, just say something good!"
The phantom remained silent.
Ye Xuan frowned. "I don't have any merits in your heart?"
The phantom said, "He has many backers!"
Ye Xuan's face immediately darkened, and he almost went berserk.
Ye Xuan took a deep breath and pointed to himself. "Sir, don't you think I'm very outstanding?
It's not an exaggeration to say that an outstanding young man like me should be the very, very, very, very, very rare kind of person in your prehistoric era, right? "
The figure shook his head.
Ye Xuan was puzzled. "Why are you shaking your head?"
The figure said, "I've existed for hundreds of thousands of years, and in these endless years, I've seen all kinds of people, but I've never seen someone with such thick skin!
Or is it that modern humans are all so thick-skinned? "
Ye Xuan was speechless.
The mysterious man continued, "You've said so much because you want us to help you improve your physical body, right?"
Ye Xuan nodded. "That's right."
The phantom said, "Why should I help you improve your physical body?
Can you give me a reason? "
Ye Xuan thought for a moment, then said, "Why don't you state your conditions!"
After a moment of silence, the phantom said, "You don't have anything that we want."
Ye Xuan suddenly said, "A favor!"
The phantom looked at Ye Xuan. "A favor?"
Ye Xuan smiled and said, "Yes.
Help me, and I'll owe you a favor. "
The phantom said softly, "You're trying to get something for nothing!"
Ye Xuan: "…"
The phantom suddenly said, "Okay!"
Ye Xuan was stunned, then said, "You agree?"
The phantom nodded. "I agree!
Come with me to the Northern Desolate! "
Ye Xuan hesitated, then said, "The Northern Desolate?"
The phantom said, "Afraid?"
Ye Xuan hurriedly shook his head. "With your strength, if you want to kill me, isn't it a piece of cake?
Why do you have to trick me to the Northern Desolate? "
The phantom said, "Let's go!"
After that, the space in front of Ye Xuan suddenly cracked.
Ye Xuan hesitated, then looked to the right, and cupped his fists. "Third Young Lady, thank you for all this time!"
After that, he walked into the space crack.
The phantom also disappeared.
On the other side, the Third Young Lady looked at Ye Xuan disappearing in the distance, silent.
...
The Northern Desolate.
When Ye Xuan came out of the teleportation array, he directly appeared in front of a huge stone tablet!
Ye Xuan glanced around. This is the Northern Desolate!
And not far from him stood a woman, the woman's fingertips flashed with knife light.
Saint!
And behind the Saint were Ge Yao and the others.
When Ye Xuan saw Ge Yao and the others, his expression changed.
Behind Ge Yao, there were more than two hundred people, these people at least above the Immortal State, judging from their aura.
And the woman at the head of the group, her strength was unfathomable.
This Northern Desolate is so strong!
Ge Yao looked at Ye Xuan, not particularly friendly.
Glancing at them, Ye Xuan said with a smile, "Hello, everyone!"
The Saint looked at Ye Xuan. "Young Master Ye, you want to strengthen your body?"
Ye Xuan nodded. "Yes."
Then, he looked at the Saint. "How should I address you, young lady?"
The Saint smiled. "Mu Xi!"
Ye Xuan said, "Miss Mu Xi, where is the senior who brought me here?"
Mu Xi smiled. "Young Master Ye, please wait for a moment. The Exalted God will appear soon."
Ye Xuan nodded. "Okay!"
Then, he looked around. It was surrounded by clouds and he could not see far.
Mu Xi smiled. "Young Master Ye seems to be a bit curious about the Northern Desolate Region!"
Ye Xuan said with a smile, "Indeed!
Miss Mu Xi, there is one thing I am very curious about. That is, how are your realms divided? "
Then, he pointed at Ge Yao. "For example, he should be in the Immortal State in our era. What about in your era?"
Mu Xi smiled. "The Immortal State you speak of is in the Dao Scripture System, right?"
Ye Xuan nodded. "Yes."
Mu Xi said, "In our era, he is called the Dao Defiant State."
Ye Xuan frowned. "Dao Defiant?"
Mu Xi nodded. "At his level, he can reverse the Death Qi in his body and gradually turn it into Life Qi … This action is equivalent to going against the heavens. Therefore, in our era, he is called the Dao Defiant State.
He has the ability to reverse the Dao and reverse life and death! "
Ye Xuan asked again, "What about above the Dao Defiant State?"
Mu Xi smiled. "Eternal!"
Ye Xuan blinked. "Eternal Realm?"
Mu Xi nodded. "At this level, the body is eternal, the soul is eternal, and the spirit is eternal!
Of course, the lifespan will still disappear. However, it is possible for an expert of this level to live for hundreds of thousands of years. Of course, the premise is that they are not killed by others or seek their own death. "
Ye Xuan said softly, "Is there anyone who can live forever?"
Mu Xi looked at Ye Xuan. "No!"
Ye Xuan looked at Mu Xi. "In your era, no one can live forever?"
Mu Xi shook her head. "I can tell you that a person, through cultivation, can live for a very, very long time, even millions of years. But up until now, in our recorded history, no one has been able to live forever.
Even the Gods are limited by their lifespan and are unable to achieve true eternal life. "
Ye Xuan was a little puzzled. "Why can't true eternal life be achieved?"
Mu Xi smiled. "If someone can achieve true eternal life, then there is only one possibility. That is, the current laws of the universe have completely collapsed!"
Ye Xuan was a little curious. "The laws of the universe?"
Mu Xi nodded. "According to what we know, there are currently nine laws of the universe. One of them is the Life Law. Everyone's lifespan is limited by the Life Law. No one can live forever. No life can achieve eternal existence.
Because once someone lives forever, the universe will be in chaos.
Think about it, if a person can't die, wouldn't that be terrifying? "
Ye Xuan nodded. "That's true!"
Mu Xi continued. "Some people can go against the Dao. However, no one can go against the laws of the universe. That's not right. At least no one can go against the first five laws of the universe.
If someone can go against the Eternal Law, perhaps they can really live forever. However, it is basically impossible! "
Ye Xuan was a little curious. "Why is it impossible?"
Mu Xi smiled slightly. "The laws of the universe are existences of a higher level. We're only in contact with the Dao now, but the laws of the universe are existences that surpass the Dao."
When she spoke up to here, she glanced at Ye Xuan and said, "Your Adversity Constitution belongs to a different kind of existence, an extremely different kind of existence!"
Ye Xuan asked, "A different kind of existence?
Does it belong to the laws of the universe? "
Mu Xi shook her head. "I'm unable to answer that. Because I only know that there are nine laws of the universe. However, I don't know exactly which nine laws they are.
So, I can't be sure if your Adversity Constitution is related to the laws of the universe. "
Ye Xuan hesitated for a moment, and then he asked, "What if my Adversity Constitution is really the work of the laws of the universe?"
Mu Xi thought for a long time, and then she said, "Be a good person in your next life!"
Ye Xuan was speechless.
Right at this moment, the stone stele behind Ye Xuan suddenly trembled, and a voice resounded from within it.
Mu Xi looked at Ye Xuan. "Follow me!"
Ye Xuan glanced at the stone stele, and then he said, "What are you Exalted Goddess doing inside?"
Mu Xi said, "It's a secret!"
A secret!
Ye Xuan was speechless.
Mu Xi suddenly said, "Young Master Ye, I heard that the woman who wanted to beat you up is your aunt?"
Ye Xuan nodded. "Yes, she said she's my aunt!"
Mu Xi said, "Since there's an aunt, there must be a grandfather. Why don't you go look for your grandfather?"
Ye Xuan shrugged. "I think it's said that my grandfather was killed by my cheapskate father!"
Mu Xi stopped in her tracks and turned to look at Ye Xuan. "Killed by your father?"
Ye Xuan nodded. "That's what they said!"
Mu Xi frowned slightly. "Your father killed your father-in-law?"
Ye Xuan nodded. "Actually, it's hard for me to understand too. However, I heard that my grandfather isn't a good person either!"
Mu Xi said softly, "Your family … is really amazing!"
Ye Xuan was curious. "Miss Muxi, can your Exalted Deity defeat that woman?"
Mu Xi shook her head, "I don't know!
We'll only know after we fight! "
Ye Xuan said, "Do you have any good suggestions for my current situation?"
Mu Xi thought for a moment, and then she said, "You can ask your aunt if we can spare their lives if they surrender!"
Ye Xuan was speechless.
..
!!







Chapter 1499
Ye Xuan glanced at Mu Xi. This woman's words were quite amusing!
Could he not be killed if he surrendered?
However, he could ask her when the time came.
Before long, Mu Xi brought Ye Xuan to a cloud. Not far from the two of them, there were countless flashes of lightning.
It was a pool of lightning!
Ye Xuan looked at Mu Xi. "Miss Mu Xi, are you going to use the heavenly lightning to temper my body?"
Mu Xi shook her head. "Not for you!"
Ye Xuan was a little puzzled. "Then?"
Mu Xi looked at Ye Xuan. "Absorb!"
Ye Xuan was stunned. "Absorb the lightning?"
Mu Xi nodded. She looked at the pool of lightning in the distance. "This pool of lightning is the heavenly tribulation lightning of our era. It contains extremely pure lightning power. If you can absorb the lightning elements, your body should be able to break through again."
Ye Xuan looked at the pool of lightning. Within it, lightning flashed, and the might of the heavens was oppressive.
Mu Xi suddenly said, "Go!"
Ye Xuan hesitated. "Is it dangerous?"
Mu Xi nodded. "Yes!"
Ye Xuan blinked. "What danger?"
Mu Xi said, "It might electrocute you to death!"
Ye Xuan, "…"
After a while, Ye Xuan didn't ask anymore. He walked towards the pool of lightning. The closer he got to the pool of lightning, the stronger the might of the heavenly lightning.
Ye Xuan stopped and turned to look at Mu Xi. "Miss Mu Xi, are you going to absorb it forcefully?"
Mu Xi looked at Ye Xuan. "Yes!"
Ye Xuan nodded. "Alright!"
With that, he transformed into a sword light and entered the pool of lightning.
Boom!
As soon as he entered the pool of lightning, countless bolts of lightning struck Ye Xuan. In an instant, Ye Xuan became a man of lightning.
Was it painful?
Ye Xuan didn't feel much pain, just a little numb.
Meanwhile, Mu Xi suddenly pointed with her finger, and a ray of white light entered the space between Ye Xuan's brows. At the same time, Mu Xi's voice resounded in Ye Xuan's mind. "This is a mental cultivation technique. Follow it and you'll be able to absorb the Heavenly Lightning Tribulation in the surroundings into your body, and then convert it into lightning energy to strengthen your body!"
Ye Xuan nodded. A moment later, he began to circulate the mental cultivation method. Gradually, the lightning in his surroundings began to be absorbed by his body. At this moment, he felt warm and comfortable.
Ye Xuan grinned. This was the first time he felt so comfortable cultivating his physical body. In the past, when he cultivated his physical body, he was in so much pain that he wanted to die!
Actually, the main reason was that his physical body was strong enough, which was why he could do it so easily!
A moment later, Ye Xuan calmed himself down and concentrated on absorbing the tribulation lightning.
Mu Xi turned around and left.
Mu Xi arrived in front of the stone tablet, and a phantom image appeared on the stone tablet.
It was the mysterious Exalted Deity.
Mu Xi said softly, "Exalted Deity still chose him!"
Exalted Deity said, "It's not that I chose him, but that we had no choice but to form a good relationship with him!"
Mu Xi said, "Isn't there still that mysterious woman?"
Exalted Deity said softly, "Choosing that woman will lead to eternal damnation!"
Mu Xi said in a low voice, "Exalted Deity, did you discover something?"
Exalted Deity said, "The Body of Adversity is scarier than I imagined!
The fact that that young man could survive until now means that there must be a powerful expert protecting him. Otherwise, he would not have been able to survive until now.
And the person who can resist the Body of Adversity … "
At this point, she didn't say anything else.
Mu Xi said, "That mysterious woman must know how powerful the person behind him is, but she still did it. Why?"
Exalted Deity said, "I don't know.
But from the looks of it, this woman is a little crazy.
What my clan needs to do is to form a good relationship with that young man, and then wait and see what happens.
If the mysterious woman wins, we just won't be able to obtain the Mysterious Temple of Heaven and Earth, but our clan can continue to pass on.
If that Ye Xuan wins, our clan will benefit greatly. "
Mu Xi nodded. "I understand!
But what if that woman wants us to choose a side? "
Exalted Deity said softly, "Then we will choose Ye Xuan!"
Mu Xi was curious. "Why?"
Exalted Deity said, "Do you believe in justice?"
Mu Xi shook her head. "Not really. Since ancient times, whoever wins is justice."
Exalted Deity said softly, "Then you can believe it!"
Mu Xi was a little curious. "Ye Xuan is justice?"
Exalted Deity said, "Have you seen the Five Dimensional Universe?"
Mu Xi was slightly stunned, then she said softly, "I understand!"
As she said this, she seemed to have thought of something and frowned. "Something is not right. Ye Xuan has the Body of Adversity, and shouldn't he be punished by heaven?
But he is like a fish in water in the Five Dimensional Universe. Not only is he not punished by heaven, but he also has a good relationship with the Tendo of the Five Dimensional Universe. Most importantly, there are countless Heaven and Earth Spirits in the Five Dimensional Universe … These Heaven and Earth Spirits actually do not reject him … This is really strange!
Not only do they not reject him, I can feel that those Heaven and Earth Spirits and people in the Five Dimensional Universe respect him like a god … He does not want to be someone with the Body of Adversity, but someone with the Body of Kindness! "
Exalted Deity said, "There are two reasons. First, someone is helping him to resist the karma of the Body of Adversity. Second, he is slowly changing his own fate!
Nothing is absolute in this world, even the Body of Adversity. "
Mu Xi said in a low voice, "Can this Body of Adversity really be reversed?"
Exalted Deity said, "Everything is possible!"
Mu Xi shook her head. "I am still a little worried about that woman!
If we help Ye Xuan, I am afraid that she will target us! "
Exalted Deity said after a moment of silence, "If she dares to target my clan, my clan will move to the Five Dimensional Universe and live and die with Ye Xuan."
Mu Xi looked at Exalted Deity. "Are you serious?"
Exalted Deity said, "This woman wants to lead my clan by the nose, how can we let her do as she pleases?
If she bullies us too much, then we will all perish together.
The reason why my clan has survived until now is not because we are weak.
Moreover, it is better to die tragically than to live in humiliation.
No matter what era it is, we still need our pride and dignity. If we don't have pride and dignity, what is the point of living? "
Mu Xi smiled slightly. "I understand.
If that woman dares to bully my clan again, we will beat her to death. Even if we cannot defeat her, we will still beat her. "
Exalted Deity said, "Go and awaken more people!
To deal with everything! "
Mu Xi nodded. "Understood!"
After saying that, she turned and left.

Holy Region.
Inside the bamboo house, the mysterious woman was reading an ancient book in her hands. She would smile from time to time.
At this moment, Holy Leader suddenly appeared outside the bamboo house. Holy Leader bowed respectfully to the bamboo house. "Master, the Third Lady is here!"
The mysterious woman put down the ancient book and smiled. "Please!"
Outside the bamboo house, the Third Lady turned and left. After a while, the Third Lady walked into the bamboo house. She looked around and said softly, "So simple!"
The mysterious woman smiled. "Third Lady, please take a seat!"
The Third Lady looked at the seat opposite the mysterious woman. There was a teacup on the table.
The Third Lady smiled. "Looks like you had a guest before!"
The mysterious woman nodded. "She just left!"
The Third Lady sat in front of the mysterious woman. She looked at the ancient book in the mysterious woman's hands. "What book is this?"
The mysterious woman smiled. "Refreshing literature!"
The Third Lady blinked. "Refreshing literature?"
The mysterious woman nodded and smiled. "It's something that makes people feel relaxed and happy. However, this kind of literature has many flaws. For example, the style of writing is worrisome, lacking in content, often digging holes, repeating the same routine, and even contradictory …"
The Third Lady asked, "Just pure refreshing?"
The mysterious woman nodded. "Yes!
Refreshing to the end! "
The Third Lady looked at the mysterious woman. "You actually know how to read this!"
The mysterious woman placed the ancient book in front of her. She smiled. "I'm just a layman. Those literary works are too profound. I can't understand them.
Moreover, life is stressful. Reading refreshing literature to relieve boredom is not bad! "
The Third Lady smiled. "You have a stressful life?"
The mysterious woman blinked. "My enemies are very powerful. For example, that plain-dressed woman!
She can kill me with one sword strike. Don't you think I'm stressful? "
The Third Lady was speechless.
You know that she can kill you with one sword strike. Yet you still target her brother!
At this time, the mysterious woman handed the ancient book to the Third Lady. "Do you want to take a look?
Maybe it can relieve your worries! "
The Third Lady took the ancient book. She opened it and looked at it. After a long time, she frowned and closed the book. "The intelligence of the villain in this book is too low!"
The mysterious woman laughed. "It seems that this book is not suitable for you!"
The Third Lady thought for a moment and continued to read. After about a quarter of an hour, she shook her head again. "It's really hard to understand!"
The mysterious woman laughed. "Actually, I've read quite a lot of refreshing novels. Most of them are the same. For example: leveling up, killing monsters and picking up treasures. Cave Academy's auction. Completing a mission and entering a mystic realm. Changing planes in the Immortal World and God World. Excellent talent. Cultivating for a year is equivalent to ten years. There's an old man in the ring … Haha …"
The Third Lady was speechless.
The mysterious woman picked up the teacup and took a sip of tea. Then she smiled. "Alright, alright!
Let's get down to business!
Is there something you need from me? "
The Third Lady nodded. "I just wanted to tell you that Young Master Ye came to my Dao Sect before!"
The mysterious woman said, "About you sparring with him?"
The Third Lady nodded. "Yes.
You're not angry, right? "
The mysterious woman smiled. "You came and told me!
I'm not angry! "
The Third Lady smiled. "Thank you!
To be honest, it's hard to survive in the middle of all of you.
But I've decided to seal my Dao Sect. I won't interfere with anything in the world anymore! "
The mysterious woman shook her head. "That's not necessary!
I'm not a heinous person. I won't kill the innocent.
I can understand that you want to form a good relationship with him. "
The Third Lady looked at the mysterious woman. "You don't look like a bad person!
If I'm not wrong, you're targeting Ye Xuan. No matter if Ye Xuan is dead or alive, you'll definitely die, right? "
The mysterious woman smiled. "You're very smart, just like that Miss Nian Nian."
The Third Lady shook her head. "It's hard to understand why you're doing this!"
The mysterious woman smiled. She didn't say anything.
At this moment, the Sacred Leader appeared outside the bamboo house. "Master, Ye Xuan is in the Northern Wilderness. The Northern Wilderness is helping him!"
The mysterious woman smiled. "I've underestimated the Northern Wilderness!
I can't entertain you anymore!
I'm going to the Northern Wilderness. "
With that, she stood up and left.
The Third Lady suddenly said. "Perhaps the Northern Wilderness is the same as me. They just want to form a good relationship with him!"
The mysterious woman smiled. "Let's make a bet. How hard do you think the Northern Wilderness will be?"
Third Young Mistress said in a low voice, "What if they insist?"
The mysterious woman blinked. "Do you really think my goal is to win over the Beihuang Region?"
Third Young Lady was speechless.
....
PS: I have something to do in my hometown!
I might not be able to update five to six times a day like before!
Sorry!!

Chapter 1500
Beihuang.
In the Thunderbolt Pool, Ye Xuan was still crazily absorbing the Heavenly Tribulation Lightning. As the energy of the Heavenly Tribulation Lightning entered his body, a faint layer of lightning appeared all over his body.
His body felt warm and comfortable.
Ye Xuan closed his eyes. With his current strength, he could instantly kill some Immortal State experts. However, he knew that he still had no chance of winning against that mysterious woman!
Not to mention the mysterious woman, he had no chance of winning against an expert of the Third Young Lady's level. Because his sword could not break through the Third Young Lady's body!
Unless he combined his Life Sword and the Instant Kill Sword, together with the power of faith and four types of domains.
Under such circumstances, he might be able to pose a fatal threat to the Third Young Lady.
However, the mysterious woman was even more terrifying than the Third Young Lady!
In fact, he was quite speechless.
He had finally gotten rid of the Taoists, but he did not expect an even more terrifying enemy to appear!
A hundred times more terrifying than the Taoists!
In any case, Ye Xuan was not a person who would sit and wait for death.
His top priority now was to improve his body to the Immortal State. If his body could reach the Immortal State, his overall strength would undergo a qualitative change!
Because both the Life Sword and the Instant Kill Sword required a powerful body!
In addition, his Sword Dao had a breakthrough and his Sword Domain had a new breakthrough. As long as his body had a breakthrough, he still had a fighting chance.
The only regret was that the Insanity Demon Bloodline had been sealed!
Otherwise, his chances of winning would be higher!
Thinking of this, he was infuriated!
He had fallen into that woman's trap!
Although the Immortal Bloodline was powerful, the Insanity Demon Bloodline focused on offense!
Moreover, the bloodline could pose a threat to her … but now, it was gone!
Although he had a headache over the Insanity Demon Bloodline, he missed it after losing it.
At that moment, Ye Xuan suddenly turned around and saw a woman standing not far away!
That mysterious woman!
The corner of Ye Xuan's mouth twitched. Damn it, that woman is here!
The mysterious woman looked at Ye Xuan and said with a smile, "Tempering your body with the Heavenly Tribulation Lightning can indeed improve your body."
Ye Xuan said in a deep voice, "What are you trying to do!?"
The mysterious woman blinked. "Do you need help?"
Ye Xuan quickly shook his head.
The corners of the mysterious woman's mouth lifted slightly. "I'll help you!"
As she spoke, she opened her palm. In her hand was a throbbing bolt of lightning, a dark red bolt of lightning!
Seeing this lightning, Ye Xuan's eyelids twitched. "What kind of lightning is this?"
The mysterious woman smiled and said: "Blood-colored Heavenly Lightning, I obtained it by chance, I will give it to you!"
After she finished speaking, she flicked her finger, and the crimson bolt of lightning directly entered the pool of lightning.
Boom!
In an instant, all the lightning within the pool was transformed into nothingness. At the same time, Ye Xuan was enveloped by countless bolts of blood red lightning!
"Ah!"
Within the Lightning Pool, Ye Xuan's shrill scream suddenly rang out.
At this moment, Ye Xuan felt as if his entire body was being pierced by thousands of needles.
Ouch!
The lightning was currently corroding his body!
The mysterious woman smiled and said: "It's just a little pain, just endure it!"
As she finished speaking, she turned around to look. Not far away, stood a woman.
Mu Xi!
The mysterious woman smiled and said: "Actually, I gave the Northern Wilderness Tribe a chance, two chances. The first was to follow me, the second, you can be like the Taoist Faction, not helping each other. Unfortunately, you have no choice!"
Mu Xi looked at the mysterious woman and smiled, "You killed dozens of my people just to frame Young Master Ye … If this is the chance that you are giving us, then I don't care!"
The mysterious woman smiled. "You are very strong-willed!"
Mu Xi shook her head and smiled, "Are you here to destroy the Northern Wilderness Tribe today?"
The mysterious woman blinked. "You think I can't do it?"
"You can try!"
At this moment, a voice suddenly rang out from the stone tablet.
The next moment, a shadow suddenly appeared in front of the mysterious woman. The shadow gradually solidified, revealing that it was a woman.
The woman was dressed in a long purple dress that reached the ground. A black cloud belt was tied around her waist, accentuating her slender waist.
Her silky hair cascaded down her back, domineering but not messy. Especially her pair of phoenix-like eyes, there was a hint of arrogance in the coldness, as if she was looking down on the world.
Exalted Goddess!
The Exalted Goddess looked at the mysterious woman. "I've been annoyed by you for a long time!"
The mysterious woman smiled and said: "Then come and hit me!"
The Exalted Goddess opened her palm and in an instant, a bolt of lightning fell from the clouds in the sky. The bolt of lightning landed directly on her palm, using her palm as a support, connecting heaven and earth.
Lightning in the palm!
In the sky, the mysterious woman smiled. "Are you going to fight?"
As she said that, she opened her hands and two balls of fire suddenly appeared in her hands!
One of the balls of fire was blood-red, the other was dark black.
The moment the two balls of fire appeared, the entire Northern Wilderness World became illusory, then slowly disappeared!
The world could not withstand the power of these two balls of fire!
In the sky, the mysterious woman suddenly fused the two balls of fire. Gradually, the two balls of fire turned into a flaming sword!
This sword, half of it was red fire, the other half was black fire.
Not far away, Mu Xi suddenly said, "Everyone, retreat."
Hearing Mu Xi's words, all the elites in the entire Northern Wilderness fled in all directions.
Mu Xi herself had also retreated hundreds of thousands of miles away!
In the entire Northern Wilderness, there were only three people left!
The mysterious woman, the Exalted Goddess, and Ye Xuan!
Ye Xuan wanted to leave too, but at that moment, he was already entangled by the bolt of lightning and there was no way he could escape!
At that moment, the Exalted Goddess clenched her right hand and floated up. The bolt of lightning in her hand was like a silver snake that swept across the sky towards the mysterious woman.
With a "chi" sound, the entire world was torn apart!
In the sky, the mysterious woman suddenly slashed down with her sword. A wave of fire swept out, turning the entire sky into a sea of fire!
The moment the sea of fire came into contact with the bolt of lightning —
Boom!
In the blink of an eye, the entire Northern Wilderness turned pitch-black!
In this pitch-black space, the bolt of lightning and the flames still existed. In the sea of fire, the bolt of lightning danced like a silver snake, tearing everything apart.
At that moment, the mysterious woman suddenly raised her sword and slashed at the bolt of lightning.
Boom!
The bolt of lightning shattered and turned into streaks of lightning that scattered all over the sky.
Below, the Exalted Goddess looked calm. She opened her palm and clenched it. "Gather!"
In an instant, the shattered lightning suddenly gathered and returned to its original state. Moreover, the aura it emitted was even stronger than before!
The Exalted God opened her left hand and closed her eyes slowly. She chanted silently and gradually, thick black clouds appeared in the sky. Then, countless lightning bolts condensed in the thick black clouds.
At that moment, the entire sky was filled with flashes of lightning. It was as if doomsday had arrived!
The Exalted Goddess suddenly opened her eyes. In her eyes, there was a flash of lightning. "Destroy!"
As soon as he finished speaking, the bolts of lightning suddenly shot towards the mysterious woman like a tidal wave.
In the distance, the mysterious woman held the Flaming Sword with a faint smile on her face. "Is that it?"
As soon as she finished speaking, she suddenly swung her sword.
Swoosh!
A beam of sword energy pierced through the air. In an instant, those terrifying lightning bolts turned into nothingness. The black hole in the entire Northern Wasteland Realm was shattered again. Countless amounts of dark matter energy exploded. However, the dark matter energy from the explosion was eventually absorbed by Ye Xuan, who was far away.
Because at that moment, Ye Xuan had activated his Dark Domain!
At that moment, he was madly absorbing the dark matter energy!
However, he was not having it easy either. This was because the shockwaves from the two women's attacks had landed on him. Even with his Daoist body, it was difficult for him to withstand the power of the two women. Fortunately, he had the Immortal Bloodline. Otherwise, he would not have been able to withstand it!
After the mysterious woman destroyed the lightning bolts with her sword, she suddenly disappeared on the spot. Below, the Exalted God suddenly took a step forward and pointed a finger at the tip of the flaming sword.
Boom!
An invisible force suddenly shook the surroundings. With the two of them as the center, everything within a radius of a million miles turned into nothingness. In the distance, Ye Xuan's eyes were wide open. His physical body was cracking inch by inch, but very quickly, his physical body began to recover at an extremely fast speed.
The Immortal Bloodline!
At that moment, Ye Xuan felt the terror of the Immortal Bloodline!
In the distance, the mysterious woman held the Exalted Goddess's finger and smiled. "Telekinesis!
How interesting! "
With that, she held the sword and spun it gently.
Boom!
The Exalted Goddess instantly retreated thousands of feet away. However, the moment she stopped, the space between the mysterious woman's eyebrows suddenly split open. Almost at the same time, the crack between her eyebrows returned to normal. However, behind her, a mysterious force spread out, covering a distance of a million miles. Wherever this mysterious force passed, everything turned into nothingness.
Fortunately, the Northern Wilderness was a remote area. Apart from the Divine City, there were no other forces within a radius of tens of millions of miles. Otherwise, the Exalted Goddess's mysterious attack would have been enough to destroy hundreds of millions of lives.
Seeing that the mysterious woman was unharmed, the Exalted Goddess's eyes turned serious for the first time. "How is this possible!"
The mysterious woman gently touched her eyebrows and smiled. "Is this your strongest attack?
It's very strong!
Unfortunately, even if this attack was ten times stronger, it still wouldn't be able to kill me!
Do you know why? "
The Exalted Goddess looked at the mysterious woman. "The power of your bloodline!"
The mysterious woman nodded and slowly walked towards the Exalted Goddess. "Yes.
Other than those three, no one can kill me with a single attack! "
As she spoke, her aura became stronger and stronger, almost multiplying by several times!
The Exalted Goddess said softly, "You didn't use your full strength just now!"
The mysterious woman smiled. "I used about 30% of my strength!"
The Exalted Goddess nodded. "I underestimated you!"
The mysterious woman smiled. "Don't worry, although I'm not a Swordsman, my sword is very fast. I guarantee that you will die painlessly!"
The Exalted Goddess looked at the mysterious woman. "Come on!"
As soon as she finished speaking, a mysterious force quietly gathered in the palm of her right hand.
The mysterious woman was about to draw her sword when Ye Xuan suddenly appeared in front of the Exalted Goddess.
The mysterious woman stopped in her tracks and looked at Ye Xuan. She smiled. "Are you going to fight me?"
Ye Xuan shook his head. "There's still a small gap between us."
The mysterious woman laughed. "A small gap … You're so fresh in admitting defeat!
You're just like your old man, thick-skinned! "
Ye Xuan looked at the mysterious woman. "Are you afraid of Qing 'er?"
The mysterious woman nodded. "I am!"
Ye Xuan said in a low voice, "You can't defeat her?"
The mysterious woman gently brushed her hair behind her ear with her left hand and smiled. "She can beat me up!"
The Exalted Goddess was puzzled. "Then why are you so against me?
Moreover, you're my aunt!
I'm not begging for mercy, I just don't understand. Can you explain it to me? "
The mysterious woman looked at Ye Xuan. "It has something to do with your mother!
It has something to do with you! "
Ye Xuan blinked. "Then go and look for my mother!"
The mysterious woman shook her head. "I can't kill your mother. Moreover, she's protected by your old man. I can't do anything to her!"
Ye Xuan jumped up in anger. "So you came to look for me?"
The mysterious woman smiled. "I'm a bully. Come and hit me!"
"I …"
Ye Xuan was so angry he almost died on the spot.
At this moment, the mysterious woman suddenly turned to look at the sky. She smiled. "I'll give you face. I won't kill her!"
With that, she turned and walked away.
The Exalted Goddess seemed to have noticed something. Her eyes narrowed. "Woman, what are you doing!"
The mysterious woman smiled. "Since the Northern Wilderness Tribe isn't going to help, I can only choose your enemy."
The Exalted Goddess suddenly tugged at Ye Xuan's hand. "Stop her!
Otherwise, you'll be finished! "
Ye Xuan was speechless.
