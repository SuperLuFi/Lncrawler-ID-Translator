만렙 영웅님께서 귀환하신다!

9권 10화

치이이익!!

기존의 기름과는 차원이 다른 느낌으로 끓어오르던 기름은 땅에 쏟아지기가 무섭게 섬뜩한 소리를 내며 끓어올랐다.

삐......삐익?!

어찌나 놀랐는지 울음소리까지 돌변한 불닭이가 처절하게 발버둥 치며 벗어나려 하지만 녀석의 전신을 봉하고 있는 주술, 혹은 이형의 힘으로 만들어진 사슬은 녀석을 놓아주지 않았다.

쾅!!

또 한 번 내 발이 솥의 일부를 걷어찬다.

동시에 소량 튀긴 기름이 녀석의 코앞에 떨어지며 간담을 서늘하게 만들었다.

당연 패닉에 빠진 녀석이 기겁하는 건 당연했다.

불로 이루어진 화염 그 자체라 불리는 주작이지만 그 불의 근원을 봉인 당한 이상 녀석도 피륙으로 이루어진 몸뚱아리일 뿐이다.

태생부터 불과 친숙한 녀석이 타죽게 생겼으니 그 패닉은 말도 못할 정도이리라.

끼이이이이이익!!

구슬픈 녀석의 울음소리에 내가 씨익 웃어 보였다.

"어이구, 또 실수."

빙글빙글 웃으면 녀석의 부리를 쓰다듬어주자 떨리는 동공으로 나를 올려다보는 게 보였다.

"화내지 마. 성질 부리지 마. 네 주인은 나고, 넌 내 염원으로 태어났다."

끼......끼이익.......

"내가 존재하기에 네가 존재한다는 사실을 기억해라. 네가 네 성질대로 난동을 부려서 내게 피해가 온다면......"

말 안 해도 알겠지?

말끝을 흐린 나는 솥을 맨손으로 툭툭 두드렸다.

펄펄 끓는 기름 때문에 근처에만 가도 뜨거운 수준이었지만 힘을 대부분 봉인 당한 녀석과 다르게 나는 멀쩡하게 그것을 견딜 방법이 존재했다.

결국, 닭똥 같은 눈물을 구슬프게 흘려대며 처절하게 울어대는 녀석의 모습에 나는 미련 없이 녀석을 구속하고 있던 주박의 인을 해제했다.

푸욱!!

동시에 벌떡 일어난 녀석이 제 머리를 땅속에 처박아버렸다.

파들파들 떠는 모습이 어찌나 무서웠던 건지 쉽게 진정될 기미가 보이지 않았다.

"자자, 머리 땅속에 박아넣어도 네 몸은 밖에 있다. 기름에 넣지 않을 테니 겁먹지 마."

말은 그렇게 해도 나에 대한 두려움이 뼛속까지 각인되었는지 녀석은 요지부동으로 버텨댔다.

이에 힘을 주어 녀석의 머리를 땅속에서 빼낸 뒤 목을 끌어안고 뒷목 부분을 톡톡 두드려주자 구슬픈 울음소리가 울려 퍼졌다.

"우와......지독하다."

기가 막힌다는 표정으로 일리나의 일침이 날아들었다.

넌 모를 거다.

성질 더러운 신수를 오냐오냐 키웠다간 무슨 꼴이 나는지.

몸 안에 있는 도력과 내 염원으로 만들어진 이 녀석의 사고방식은 아직 어리다.

이런 녀석이 고압적인 성격 그대로 성장할 경우 짧게는 몇 년 내에 감당할 수 없는 망나니가 되리라.

실제로 내게 부적술과, 신수소환술, 혹은 주술이나 도술을 가르쳤던 내 스승의 경우. 마냥 좋을 대로 네 마리의 신수를 길렀다가 피를 본 아주 적절한 케이스였다.

처음 신수와의 친화도를 쌓기 위해 스승이 불러낸 신수와 대면하다가 주작에게 쪼이고 불태워진 횟수만 수백 회.

흉폭한 청룡이 내지른 벼락에 맞은 횟수가 수십 회.

가만히 있다가 머리 채로 현무에게 물린 횟수가 수천 번.

개무시에 사고란 사고는 다 치고 다니는 백호를 얌전하게 만드는데 걸린 시간이 수십 년이다.

영험한 놈들?

그냥 사고 치길 좋아하는 또라이 같은 놈들이다.

다만, 그럼에도 사신수가 사신수라는 명예로운 이름으로 불리는 이유는.

놈들이 똑똑하기 때문이다.

그러니까.

"나는 그 짓 못 한다."

단순히 녀석들이 내게 길들여지는 시간이 길다고 한다면 크게 문제가 없을 것이다.

다만, 내게 불만을 품을 녀석들이 칠 사고를 생각한다면.

아직 자아가 완전히 확립되기 전에 얌전하게 만들 필요가 있다.

물론, 녀석들의 기본적인 용감한 모습은 남겨놔야겠지만 말이다.

"자, 날 수 있겠어?"

끼이이이이익!

거대한 포효를 흘리며 날개를 펼치는 녀석을 보며 나는 만족스레 고개를 끄덕였다.

"좋아. 마음껏 날아봐."

끼익?

의심스런 눈초리로 고개를 갸웃거리며 나를 노려보는 불닭이의 시선이 미묘하게 가늘어졌다.

마치 내 진의를 파악하려는 듯 애쓰는 모습이었지만 이번만큼은 나로서도 다른 마음을 품지 않았다.

"태어나자마자 잡혀서 날아보지도 못했을 거 아니야. 마음껏 날아보라고. 배도 많이 고플 텐데."

이어지는 말에 결국 녀석은 눈을 크게 뜨더니 이내 날개를 펄럭거리며 한두 발 물러났다.

화르르륵!!

동시에 꺼져있던 화염이 일어나며 녀석의 몸 전체가 거대한 화염으로 돌변했고 처음으로 제 위용을 숨김없이 드러내듯 화염을 피워올렸다.

"조금 뜨거운데......."

녀석이 순간 흠칫하더니 일순간 주변을 가득 메우던 열기가 일순간 증발하듯 사라졌다.

주작의 화염은 의지의 화염.

그런 만큼 그 의지에 따라 뜨거울 수도, 얼음보다 차가울 수도 있다.

본래 성질머리대로라면 '너는 불편해해라 나는 뜨겁게 만들겠다!' 라고 하며 더욱 열기를 끌어올렸을 주작이지만.

한번 내게 크게 데인 만큼 내 한마디에 격하게 반응하는 녀석 다웠다.

"저녁까지 마음껏 날다가 오라고, 참, 노파심에 하는 말이지만, 잘못 없는 인간을 건드렸다간......알지? 알아서 구분하라고."

끼이이이익!!

크게 울며 날개를 펄럭인 녀석이 강렬한 바람을 일으키며 날아오르기 시작하자 거대한 녀석의 거대하고 긴 꼬리가 아름다운 잔재를 흩날리며 아름다운 곡선을 그려내기 시작했다.

* * *

끼이이이이이익!!

신수, 혹은 영물.

인간의 염원이 모여 만들어진 신수인 남 주작, 불닭이는 새파란 창공을 날아오르며 화염을 한껏 강렬하게 내뿜었다.

비록 이 대륙에서 불의 주인은 따로 있는 듯하나, 자신 또한 엄연히 불에서 태어난 영험한 존재가 아니던가!

비록 '불닭이'라는 치욕스런 이름을 얻긴 했지만.

결과적으로 자신은 위대한 존재라는 사실을 태어날 때부터 알고 있는 녀석이었다.

다만.

자신을 세상에 존재하게 만든 부모는 조금 괴이쩍은 존재였다.

태어날 때부터 많은 것을 본능적으로 알고 태어나는 것이 바로 신수라 할 수 있다.

주작, 불닭이가 아는 상식선에서는 본래 자신은 인간 한 명의 손에 태어날 만큼 안일한 존재가 아니라는 것 또한 분명히 인지하고 있었다.

하지만 제 부모는 공포스러운 존재였다.

조금만 잘못을 저질렀다간 정말로 그 뜨거운 기름에 자신의 힘을 봉인하고 튀겨버릴 것 같은 느낌.

태어난 지 얼마 되지 않았다 해도 가장 친숙한 뜨거움이라는 것에 죽을 뻔한 것이 어찌나 섬뜩하던지.

몸을 파르르 떨며 날아오른 주작이는 이내 넓은 숲에 도달해서야 천천히 하강했고 내려섰다.

화를 내면 죽는다!

자신은 불의 신수.

분노를 관장하는 염(炎)의 주작이다.

하지만 그 분노를 마구잡이로 발산했다간 정말로 죽을지도 모른다는 느낌이 들었다.

부모인 그 인간은 너무 무서웠다.

그 눈동자에 서린 마음은 분명 진심이었다.

성질을 죽여야 한다.

자신은 고고한 존재이지 마냥 날뛰는 도마뱀과는 다른 우아한 신수가 아닌가!

키리릭.

키에에엑!!

그때였다.

몸을 웅크린 채 눈을 감고 있던 불닭이는 문득 불이 꺼진 자신의 몸에 날아든 딱딱한 무언가에 천천히 고개를 들었다.

동시에 사방에서 모습을 드러내는 초록빛의 작은 존재들을 볼 수 있었다.

태어날 때 조금 물려받은 부모의 기억 파편을 조금 되짚어보면 이놈들의 이름은 분명.......

고블린이라고 했던 것 같다.

고블린.

인간과는 적대적인 존재. 즉, 부모와는 적대적인 존재.

아무리 분노를 관장하는 존재라 해도, 자신은 고고한 존재이기에 함부로 무언가의 목숨을 빼앗진 않는다.

하지만.

짜증이 난다. 화가 난다!

아직 어린 불닭이는 심오한 판단을 내릴 만큼 똑똑할 수 없었다.

그런 생각이 돋기가 무섭게 불닭이는 꺼뜨렸던 화염을 일제히 태우며 날개를 펼쳤다.

웅크려서 작게 보이던 몸이 일순간 거대해지자 고블린들이 움찔거리며 물러나는 게 보였다.

이 쬐끄마한 놈들까지 나를 무시해?

화가 난다.

화가 난다!!

끼에에에에에엑!!

거대한 포효를 터뜨리며 불닭이는 생각했다.

배가 고팠던 참에 마침 잘되었다.

네놈들을 모조리 불태워 씹어 삼켜주리라.

적에게 자비를 베푼다면 그것은 불의 신수, 분노의 신수가 아니다!

거대한 화염은 그런 불닭이의 마음을 대변하듯 주변을 모조리 불태우며 숲을 불바다로 만들기 시작했다.

키......키엑?!

까드득!

뭔가 잘못되었다는 것을 깨달은 고블린들이 한발 두발 물러나지만.

주작이의 날갯짓 한 번에 놈들의 퇴로는 모조리 새빨간 화염에 모두 차단되었다.

모두 불태워 주마!

동시에 불닭이의 부리 끝으로 초 고열의 열원이 모여들기 시작했다. 열원이 모여들 때마다 머리 위에 돋아난 두 갈래의 깃이 파르르 떨리며 푸르게 번뜩였다.

불닭이의 주특기 중 하나인 초고열의 브레스였다.

* * *

펄럭!! 펄럭!

날갯짓 한 번에 숲이 불타오른다.

거대한 화염 속에서 불닭이는 마치 홀린 것처럼 고블린들을 불태우고 씹어 삼켰다.

맛있다! 이렇게 맛이 있을 수가 있는가!

그런 생각을 하면서 불닭이는 닥치는 대로 고블린들을 삼켰다.

주변에 타오르는 화염?

알게 뭐야. 화염은 자신의 분노의 상징인데!

분노를 막을 수 있는 건 아무것도 존재하지 않는다.

인간만 건드리지 않으면.

본능적으로 인간을 함부로 건드리면 안 된다는 사실을 새겨버린 불닭이는 자신이 이미 조금씩 변하고 있다는 사실을 전혀 인지하지 못하고 있었다.

완전히 불바다가 되어버린 숲의 중앙에서 불닭이는 이 숲에 존재하는 적대적인 생명체.

즉, 몬스터라는 놈들을 모조리 잡아먹으리라 결심했다.

생각은 길지 않았고.

행동은 더욱 빨랐다.

정신을 차렸을 땐 이미, 황색 피부에 5미터는 될법한 거대한 생명체의 살점을 파먹고 있는 자신을 발견할 수 있었다.

이름은 오우거라고 했던 것 같지만 정확하게는 알 수 없었다.

별미로구나!

불닭이는 더욱더 신이 났다. 여기라면 마음껏 날뛰어도 될 듯싶었다.

그때였다.

쌔애애앵!! 카앙!!

숲 저편에서 날아든 날카로운 무언가가 불닭이의 날개를 강하게 때리고 튕겨 나갔다.

화르륵!!

당연 불닭이를 노린 날카로운 그것은 거대한 화염에 집어 삼켜져 완전히 잿더미가 되었지만, 기분이 나쁜 건 어쩔 수 없었다.

자신은 현명한 신수. 그러니 냉정하게 분석할 수 있다.

짧고 낮은 울음을 흘리며 불닭이는 자신을 공격한 존재를 발견할 수 있었다.

그리고 움찔거리며 굳을 수밖에 없었다.

불닭이의 눈앞에 나타난 것은 인간과는 흡사한.

하지만 인간과는 다른 존재였다.

조금 더 숲에 친숙한 느낌이 들지만. 미묘하게 자신과는 다른 무언가가 덧씌워져 있는 존재였다.

[다 좋은데......죄 없는 인간을 헤치진 마라?]

순간적으로 분노를 터뜨리려던 불닭이는 문득 제 부모가 했던 말을 떠올리고 크게 움찔거렸다.

그런 불닭이의 행동에 두어 차례의 날카로운 무언가가 또다시 날아들었다.

"숲을 불태우다니, 불의 마물이 어찌 숲에 있는지는 모르겠지만. 네놈을 그냥 둘 순 없다."

마물? 감히 고고한 불의 신수인 자신을 마물이라 칭한단 말인가?

반사적으로 화염을 일으키려던 불닭이는 한마디의 언질을 다시 기억하고 움찔거렸다.

참아야 한다.

인간을 다치게 했다간 정말로 부모가 자신을 잡아 기름 속에 던져버릴 것 같았다.

카앙!!

참아야 한다. 자신은 고고한 신수, 같잖은 도발 정도는 참을 수 있으리라.

쌔애앵, 카앙!!

참아야.......

카앙!

키에에에에엑!!!!

참긴 개뿔.

내일 당장 죽더라도 오늘 저놈들을 모조리 불태워 버리리라.

긴 귀를 가진 인간 수컷과 암컷의 모습에 불닭이는 제 부모였던 소년의 경고도 잊은 채 순간적으로 터져 나오는 분노에 몸을 움직였다.

아직 불닭이는 깊은 생각을 할 정도로 생각이 깊지 못했다.

The Manreb hero is coming back!

Episode 11 of the Nine

A thin, huge roar covered the entire forest.

At the same time, as if representing the will of the fire chicken, the burning flames intensified and created a huge wave of flames around the area.

The fire chicken was literally excited.

And he was furious.

Anger flared up at the beings who attacked him first.

I was glad that I had the opportunity to scream excitedly without holding back my anger.

Nothing here can stop you!

So you are not born weak!

I am a great new master! Spiritual and clever creature!

Garnish!!

Flapping his huge flame wings and revealing his presence again, the fire chicken looked at the two men and women gasping for breath, trampling on a creature of water droplets blocking their way.

The surrounding situation is so bad that it is difficult for oxygen to burn and even breathe.

But there was no better situation for a fire chicken than this.

The fire rooster is the master of fire.

Of course, the more fire there is, the better the environment will be for the fire rooster.

"Monster... ...monster."

When a man with long ears muttered in a tired voice, the fire chicken breathed out.

Then he flapped his wings and floated the huge body lightly, and soon he opened his beak and began collecting super-heated chunks of energy in his mouth.

Crying!!

It was a moment when the light was shot.

In an instant, a mass of energy swept through the ground and targeted the two, and the light turned red from the ground where it touched, and a high-temperature flame soon erupted.

It is strong enough to melt the ground that cannot withstand a strong shot.

Reflecting on this, a long-eared man caught a woman and threw himself away.

Crying!!

Of course, a single use of a Bress does not mean you should not use it twice.

Again, a high-temperature beam flew in and the trees were cut off as if they had swept away a sword made of light.

"Uh... ..Yurgen!"

"I can't even get my hands on the damn spirit of high water!"

"It's dangerous. Run for now."

"No! Don't forget our mission. We must go to the Palan Empire, the human empire, and subdue the man who cursed the mother of God!"

The fire chicken's eyes narrowed at the man's cry.

I understand what you're saying, but I honestly didn't know what you were talking about.

Above all.

to have no interest

What's important is that they've touched his temper!

Oh, I don't know. Burn it all!

Gosh, geez, geez, geez, geez!

Once again, a great roar reverberated around.

"But he's too strong!"

"Oh, my God!"

Then he shouted and took out a cane from the girl's side.

"Get out of here first! You're too strong!"

A unique light begins to flow out of the girl's cane, which she shouted urgently.

At the same time, the fire rooster, who noticed a subtle strangeity, held Bresse again.

Then, he released a strong beam of light and flew up with a bright red flame.

Then he flew in like a lightning bolt and bit the back of one of the two humans.

"Emily!"

At the frightened man's cry, the fire chicken bit the collar and shook the little girl, who lifted her into the air, to faint her, and trampled on the man.

You can't kill innocent people?

He's the one who attacked him.

Burn him for now!

There is a long-eared human woman in her mouth, so Bres can't shoot.

Of course, I'm not confident that I can't do anything without Bresse!

The fire rooster fluttered its wings as it flew into the air.

Currrrmrrrrrrrrrrrrr...

At the same time, clouds in the sky in a narrow area began to turn black and fireballs began to fall from there.

A man called Jurgen made a desolate expression on the attack with visuals that made his mind faint.

"Oh, my God... where is that monster..."

Seeing the rain of fire pouring from the sky, he reached out vainly and pointed to a girl shaking with a lobbed bite in the mouth of a fire chicken, but he soon poured out and took a step toward ignoring the flames that would burn his body completely.

And

Push it!

Suddenly, all the flames that turned the surrounding area into a hell of fire disappeared for a moment.

The chicken's face hardened once.

There wasn't much signal.

I could just see by instinct.

If you don't go back right now, you'll be in big trouble.

The reflexively turned fire chicken began to turn and fly at a furious speed, forgetting who was being bitten by my mouth and shaking.

* * *

"I tried to kill my temper, but as soon as I sent him for a walk, he's solving it."

Animals, new things, free beings, how long did you think you could suppress that instinct?"

"...that's true. Especially, the fire chicken is still young."

There is little difference in physical size compared to adult adults.

However, on the contrary, the mind is still very young.

I already knew that if I pressed it down, the consequences would be great.

So I sent it.

As he was the master of anger, he needed a proper way to release his anger.

After you grow up, you can control it yourself and not just vent your anger, but you still want something too big for a child to wish for that.

I grinned and raised my hand as I watched him fly away in a hurry, showing his red presence from afar.

Whoo!

And

When the fire chicken arrived before me, he looked at me with trembling eyes, threw what he had in his mouth on the floor, ran to me and pushed his beak in.

He seemed determined to act cute to appease him before he was hit, but he was determined to smite him.

Ears... Cute...

The former king, who understood the behavior first, giggled to see if such a fire chicken's behavior was cute, and Lünne made a strangely pointed expression.

I want to tell Shin-soo not to be jealous, but he was the first one who rushed recklessly to pat his beak.

"Yes, our fire rooster."

When I called him in person, I felt a slight but trembling.

I think the fear itself is clearly engraved.

"Have you had a good time?"

Kk.Kkk...Kkkkkkk...

The way he rubbed his beak into my hand with a weak sound made me laugh.

They're quite the newcomers I like when I kill them all.

When he supported his chin with his left hand and gently swept his beak's back with his right hand, he began to feel relief and languor in his eyes at the same time.

"By the way, you mean?"

It was then.

His body flinched when a small murmur came out of my mouth.

"What's that charcoal soot?"

My words stopped the fire chicken from acting.

It looks like charcoal soot.

However, it was apparent that the Spirit Manna was protecting the one who was covering the lump of charcoal.

"I must have told you not to attack anyone."

Beep! Beep! Beep!

Is it because of the voice that came out of my mouth when my smile disappeared?

The fire rooster screamed like crazy and flapped its wings.

Then he finally turned around, showed his back on the floor, showed his belly, and twisted his body around as if he were complaining.

Cook...

"......"

If he can't turn back, he will act cute as much as he can.

Watching Shin-soo's pride and everything, acting cute, I couldn't help but be scared.

Finally, after scratching his neck gently, I approached him slowly without hesitation.

Then he glanced at Rob and wiped the smile off completely.

"......"

Davy? What did you see... oh, my God.

She flew in wonderfully and opened her eyes wide after confirming that she had taken off the robe.

Illina, who was blushing as she watched the fire chicken's cute action, approached slowly and opened her eyes wide.

Elf......?

"Why is the elf here?"

I couldn't get rid of the feeling of a little embarrassment.

Then I snatched the girl's back and muttered.

There is one person in the Hines estate who knows Elphra better than anyone else.

"I have to go back to Hines for a while."

Lünne, who blinked at my words, rushed over and clung to my legs.

You're going back to the Hines? Here? How?"

"Like this."

Whoo!

When a huge wind pressure occurred with my words and a magic camp was formed, Illina stepped back with the expression, "That's right."

"Yeah... ...I'm going to ask someone who needs common sense... ...go. I'm going to go back now."

Turning around without regret, I went beyond the space.

* * *

"Oh! Silver Prince?"

If it's been a while, I'll say it's been a while.

Eurya Helicana, who was savoring tea silently inside a quiet nature-friendly room, looked at me with her eyes wide open.

Apparently, her residence was a small and beautiful tree house located in the center of the Elves' residential area.

The horse was a wooden house, but it was also a mixture of Elf's unique architectural techniques, which made the surface strength almost metal-class.

As a nature-friendly species, they kept their own culture well.

"How was your trip?"

"Well, it's been settled in moderately. There's nothing we can do about soaring food prices right now, but we've got a better one."

I was able to get out the lines and bells.

I was allowed to exist in the struggle with the goddess of the Lord's Priya.

Shin-soo goes beyond the concept of a simple summoner.

If I am in a state of contract with a masterpiece as much as a masterpiece is in charge of fire, my fire-related sorcery or magic becomes strong and diverse as the masterpiece becomes stronger.

If you are a blue dragon, you will be able to use magic or magic related to brain-like wind speed.

Current business is water.

Baekho is the land.

It is a simple example, but the unlock of the dead body also means that.

"I'm sorry I came all of a sudden. I have a matter to discuss."

Even though it was unpleasant to suddenly enter his house, Yuria picked up the tea cup next to him and handed it to me as if it was good.

"That's a good thing happened. I have a new car that I want to show to the silver."

"What's the material?"

"Hehe."

He smiles and blurs the end of his speech.

"Looking at you eating, I'm going to abide by the taste itself."

Then he gulped it down, and his mouth was filled with a different subtle scent than before.

"What did you put in?"

"I cut the peppermint ant's skin a little bit."

"It's getting weird."

She giggled when she burst into a laugh.

"Why doesn't anyone recognize my taste? The same goes for Mew. It's not even a car that looks weird."

"And what about him?"

"Kook, he ran away. It was so cute to walk backward while talking gibberish."

Apparently, he jumped out of his mouth because he didn't want to drink tea.

It seems that Uria is living with Mew now.

Soon after, I threw a faint little girl in front of her, with a chat with her behind her.

"Oh, my God."

"Do you know him?"

She was silent to my question.

"The Triad... ...Emily... ...that can't be..."

With her eyes wide open, she sprang up.

Then he ran and checked her condition and looked up at me.

"What's going on?!"

My eyes narrowed at the bewildered.

"Who do you know?"

"Former... ..of the Holy Tree... ...I've heard that the old Shindong fell asleep with the Shindong..."

"Emilya the Great"?"

"...that's right. The mark on your forehead is a mark given to the elves who share the god and life."

As Yuri said, which refers to a half-lighted trace, the girl's forehead was engraved with a half-clouded design of the moon.

"When you first become a saint of the New Tree, you have the form of a crescent moon. It's getting bigger and bigger. Sanghyeon, Manwol, Hahyeon...It changes in the order of syllables. Emilia, the Three Tides, is a moon because the will of the former world leader was about to end his life expectancy."

The life expectancy of an elf averages 200 years, or 500 years, in special cases.

It's a very unique case, and this girl named Emilia, the Triad, was like that.

Of course, for this generation of elves, the will of the world's greatest generation was just something that would appear in history.

The appearance of Emilia, the crown of King Samjo, was not surprising to see her sleeping in the crystal present in the report of the New Tree since she was a child.

"How, is Amelia out there? Besides…"

"I don't know. The fire chicken caught it, so this is the end of the story. This little Emilia is a new elf."

"That's technically true."

"Okay, then you're a hostage."

She giggled at my words.

"You're so reckless. But I will follow the silver ball. If possible, I'll keep an eye on him and take care of him. I've never seen him open his eyes in my life."

I turned my head away from her words.

"Yes, when you wake up, call the phone number."

"Yes, sir. See you, Silver."

"Any inconvenience?"

"Dwaffes helped me a lot. They were so antagonistic to each other, but... Well, this isn't bad either."

The Manreb hero is coming back!

Episode 12 of the Nine

76. A girl who wails with a mask.

The conversation was not long. Unless a small woman named Emilia, a hostage, wakes up, there is no point in waiting.

Upon returning to the Palan Empire, relieved by a smile that didn't feel much false, I looked around in a chaotic atmosphere as soon as I entered the command.

I don't know if the fire rooster caused an accident.

The atmosphere was not in a hurry to regard it as.

The soldiers who were constantly moving were all armed and tense.

This will not happen unless the fight breaks out.

The fire chicken, which left the command and took it to a quiet place so that there was no reason to make a fuss, definitely existed there.

"Fire Chicken."

Beep... Beep?

The eyes of the fire rooster drooping on a large straw mat opened round to my question.

He looks puzzled because he woke up after sleeping well on a warm day.

"What else have you done?"

The one who jumped up to my question stepped back one or two times and soon fluttered his wings, crying.

Then he shook his head desperately to express injustice.

When I saw him rubbing his head on the ground, rubbing his head against the fire that had to burn with dignity, coming to me and putting his head in as if to force him to pet him, I didn't think it was a lie.

"No?"

Beep!

"Yeah, good job."

When I took out the meat I had prepared on my way here from the subspace, he hurriedly bit the meat and stepped away from me.

"Davie, the fire chicken is a very frightening symptom. This is not the right parenting method."

"That's right."

If we raise a human child this way, we will become a parent that will never be again.

but

The new chicken will survive even if I die of old age someday.

Once born and fully grown, the life expectancy of Shin-soo is 600 years, breaking away from the yoke of his parents' lives.

Long live indefinitely under the combination of certain conditions.

If the guy who's going to be here after I'm gone has a ferocious temper.

I will not wait for such a good future.

"You'd better draw the line now."

It's like an animal's hierarchy.

"Why not?"

It wasn't such a pleasant way even when I did it.

"So what's all this mess about?"

"There was a report from the Search party that the body of the Prince of the Palan Empire was found."

"I guess you finally found it."

A girl with an ordinary impression who approached me with a robe smiled back and forth.

The impression is normal, but she is a girl with a bright smile.

However, it was different that they wore high-end lobes and robes with antique and elegant designs, not the usual monotonous white robes.

"What's with that stick? You even put Shin Sung-seok in there."

If the mana is united, the mass of the divine power is called Sinseongseok.

It's the same as the original.

It depends on how you process it, and since you use it under the name of it in the Holy Land, there is no way I will tackle it.

"Hehe, what do you think? Am I a bit of an adult candidate?"

Do I look like a candidate for a saint instead of a saint?

It would be used for this to say that you are not arrogant enough to know your position well.

She was literally a saint by nature.

"Well, you look pretty elegant."

"Blood... ..the prince is not as good at dealing with women as I thought he would be."

"I can't let anyone who lives a bachelor's life say that."

"Yes?"

She opened her eyes round at my words and tilted her head.

"A lifetime of celibacy?"

"Didn't you hear me?"

"Well... I've never heard of that before..."

As he muttered as if he had never known it, he had no idea how blocked the kingdom is.

Neither the saint nor the Pope.

The top authorities of both lines are not allowed to get married.

The reason was simple.

It was because he could be swayed by his spouse's breath.

I didn't feel the necessity of telling her.He seemed to be deliberately quiet, but he seemed to have believed it as soon as he could see how naive he was.

I think Alice, the same sex candidate, knew everything.

"Hmm..."

"That's what you'll find out later. She doesn't have anyone she wants to marry."

"By the way, I didn't know it would take this long to find the body. Well, I'm sorry to say... ..but I'm glad to hear that."

"What's the difference if you feel bitter now? We should be glad we found the body."

When dealing with the work of the Reinfos Alpha in the past.

It was different from the case of Shio Howl, the Ice Property Wizard, who died after being killed by a sudden death by my colleague, Dr. Trev.

It was not long before he died, so there was at least a resurrection, but this time it was different.

As it has been more than a week since the crown prince died officially, it is impossible to fully resuscitate even if my teacher Roaas comes, not me.

Complete resuscitation...

"Why do you think so?"

There is something about the eyes of the sex candidate, Lina, that is very similar to someone else.

Shining eyes like a puppy following its owner.

I mean...

It looks like Amy, who has been looking at me as a land agent and a maid of honor in the past.

"No, I don't know if I can stop Prince Davy..."

"I don't belong to the Holy Land. The Holy Spirit is the role of the Holy Land, and it's your power."

"Is that so...

It's a big event for now.

As the Imperial family of the Empire died, the priests were forced to remove it, but this time, as the saint candidate Lina was here, she was willing to step up and get something more from the Palan Empire.

That's why Seongguk is a place where people live.

"Oh, good boy."

Beep...

Lina, a saint who smiled and approached the fire chicken fearlessly and stroked her beak, had something that naturally made her feel good about her.

And that charm would have made her feel uncomfortable but not hurt her.

That must have been the source of power she has survived so far.

"What if you get bitten?"

"How can such a good boy bite? It's a little bit of a temper, but it's a nice little boy by nature."

It is said that the eyes can see through the essence.

She was unaware that she was already on the threshold of a saint.

It was then.

Booooooooooooooo!!

From far away, a bugle was heard announcing the return of the soldiers.

"You must be back. I'll be right there. Would you like to come with me?"

"I'll have to show you my face."

* * *

In a solemn atmosphere, knights in white armor pulled out their swords and lined up.

Chuck! Chuck! Chuck!

Then, whenever the procession from the gate passed, the sword was moved in a disciplined manner to salute.

Then, starting with seven white horses at the forefront, as many as 10 people were seen walking one step by one with a large coffin in a disciplined manner, as if they were in line with a five and a row.

The figures in the coffin were not usually aristocratic or imperial.

He was the Crown Prince of the Palan Empire, which is called the strongest nation on the continent.

Illina's expression as she led the procession looked more disastrous than she had imagined.

Her expression, which appeared below the circle, was not visible on the outside, but the cold-feeling expression seemed colder than usual.

Is that what masks are like?

The biggest issue left after the death of the Necromans, the main culprit behind the incident, is to recover the body of the Crown Prince of the Palan Empire.

Then, after a long fight, Illina eventually managed to recover my brother's body.

"The body's fine... ..but..."

"But?"

"There wasn't, my heart..."

Compared to other bodies, the crown prince's body was still intact.

Inside the coffin, the body of a man lay beautifully with numerous flowers.

The corruption of the shrines seemed somehow to have been obscured, but now that they have already begun to decay once, it is just a good-looking, good-looking piece of grinder.

"Aurbani, like his father, was an extremely supportive group of peace on the continent."

There shouldn't be a war.

"It was my brother who shouted, "When peace is made, there is room, and if the yoke of hatred is broken, everyone in each country can look at each other in a neutral and unbiased way.""

In the process, they clashed with Salibans and other extremist princes who thought everything for the Palan Empire.

"He was actually the only member of the Imperial family who supported the war completely."

"Weren't we separate?"

"Well, not all the imperial family like me. In fact, most of the imperial families are keeping me in check... ...but thanks to my big brother, there was no big problem."

She was in her position that there was no foolish imperial family to touch her greatly.

She is not called the forbidden corn leaf of the Palan Empire for nothing.

Unlike Arya, the youngest daughter of the Lindis Empire, who was ill and had a history of Suincheon University, she was a very delicate woman who used her strength to shake off all checks and firmly established her position.

"Ilina."

At that time, Salivan slowly approached Illinois, who was staring at the coffin.

"Salivan's brother?"

"Iilina, I'm sorry, but I think your brother's state funeral should be held here, not in the capital."

Illina's eyes were wide open by his words.

"What's that?! No way!"

"No, this is a decision as the next Crown Prince. Don't throw up."

Speaking calmly, he put his hand on Illinois' shoulders.

"Get your hands off me! Do you think this makes sense?! Ha! The next prince?! Is that why you postponed it until your big brother died and you recovered the body that was confirmed to be dead?"

"I'm sorry."

Illina, who was furious, burst into tears as if her sorrow had risen.

She wouldn't have shown such weakness.

When I patted her back without a word, she came to me without knowing who was next to me and burst into tears.

"I will put on makeup in about a week because I need some preparation. Prince Davy, you are not acquainted with my brother... ...but please attend for my brother."

"Hmm...

"I beg of you."

Even in this situation, he made an offer without erasing his original expression, and when I saw Illinois crying silently, I turned away.

* * *

A week

It was neither short nor long.

During that time, Saliban used his authority to respond to a food deal with the blocked Hines estate and sold part of the surplus to Hines, except for the food to be used to help its people.

He seemed unexpectedly unkind, but he kept at least one promise as an empire.

Illinois criticized it for being so cold, but he remained adamant.

The Crown Prince of the Palan Empire was disqualified as a Crown Prince, but he was also a decent man.

"She was so optimistic. One day there will be a world where there will be no war and peace will be maintained... ...and there will be a day when we can work hand in hand with diplomacy, not with spears and swords. I... ...I loved that brother."

Illina murmured with a resigned face as she saw the crown prince's body lying on a large wooden pedestal.

Perhaps because he wanted to cry but tried not to cry next to someone else, he looked skin and bones.

In the meantime, her fraudulent appearance did not lose her light, but rather made her look like a sickly beauty.

"He knew better than anyone else that the world needed too much sacrifice to come. And I knew it was impossible with my own power. I'm the only one who can do that."

Illina glared at him with spiteful eyes at Salivan's mumbling.

"Do you know what sacrifice is?""

Her vehement cry sadly was not heard by the people around her.

Only two people who were right next to the bodies and a few with keen hearing could be heard.

It is not a lie that countless people came as the director of the Crown Prince of the Palan Empire, not anyone else, but because their hearing is not as keen as animals.

"Ilina."

"Let go! I hate Salivan. If I had helped you a little while you were alive... ...I wouldn't have!"

At her cry, Salivan only gave a bitter smile.

"Yes... ...I didn't know anything, but politics isn't as easy as you think. Illina, I'll ask you a question. I have an unspeakable situation, so I hold my brother's state funeral here. If you go up to the capital and do it as you say."

"......"

"If you have a problem then are you confident you can handle it? There is also a limit to seeing that there is no iron."

Life, which cannot be seen as a family, is mixed with each other and glares at each other.

His voice was cold and cold.

While watching the fight between those two.

I spoke to Persehrk without any response or comment.

'It's almost a movie. Persec, do you have any popcorn?'

Your personality is very artistic.

'I know you can use a little bit of physical force, but don't go out of the way.'

You're just gonna wait and see? But I think that's the one you've given her a lot of course.

Unlike the two of them. I'm the remnant of something between the two.

a squeaking sound

When I saw one thing printed in the status window, I clicked my tongue briefly.

[Putting the end of the contamination] the purification of the spirit that has been contaminated and reached the ring of reincarnation the possibility of abnormalities in the orbit of the rotation in the future in the event of non-compliance is high.]

"Pretending to be a threat, but being useless... ..."

I wonder if the nosy subject makes sense.

Or maybe it's the nosy one for me.

The trauma of someone's death lingered longer than I thought.

The Manreb hero is coming back!

Episode 12 of the Nine

76. A girl who wails with a mask.

The conversation was not long. Unless a small woman named Emilia, a hostage, wakes up, there is no point in waiting.

Upon returning to the Palan Empire, relieved by a smile that didn't feel much false, I looked around in a chaotic atmosphere as soon as I entered the command.

I don't know if the fire rooster caused an accident.

The atmosphere was not in a hurry to regard it as.

The soldiers who were constantly moving were all armed and tense.

This will not happen unless the fight breaks out.

The fire chicken, which left the command and took it to a quiet place so that there was no reason to make a fuss, definitely existed there.

"Fire Chicken."

Beep... Beep?

The eyes of the fire rooster drooping on a large straw mat opened round to my question.

He looks puzzled because he woke up after sleeping well on a warm day.

"What else have you done?"

The one who jumped up to my question stepped back one or two times and soon fluttered his wings, crying.

Then he shook his head desperately to express injustice.

When I saw him rubbing his head on the ground, rubbing his head against the fire that had to burn with dignity, coming to me and putting his head in as if to force him to pet him, I didn't think it was a lie.

"No?"

Beep!

"Yeah, good job."

When I took out the meat I had prepared on my way here from the subspace, he hurriedly bit the meat and stepped away from me.

"Davie, the fire chicken is a very frightening symptom. This is not the right parenting method."

"That's right."

If we raise a human child this way, we will become a parent that will never be again.

but

The new chicken will survive even if I die of old age someday.

Once born and fully grown, the life expectancy of Shin-soo is 600 years, breaking away from the yoke of his parents' lives.

The Manreb hero is coming back!

Episode 13 of the Nine

"How dare you say that there's a moron who dies knowing he's going to die? Stop it. I don't want to talk to a cold-blooded man like you after this day."

"Ilina."

"I have nothing more to say. If you don't want to mourn your big brother, please go down. Now!

"Whoa..."

Illina, glaring at him as he retreated with a blur of words, seized the body of my brother, who looked as clean as if he would happen at any moment.

a heartless body

The other part is fine, but the heart disappears because it's undead.

It wouldn't have been.

Perhaps, the commander Dayan or Rich Clair Orphan had used his hands before that.

I don't have a way to figure out the reason yet.

"You're pretty good at talking. I'll just be taken in for a while."

"I have no idea what you're talking about. It's not just a good feeling, so let's stop here."

Slowly step back and look at the salivan approaching me, when I said nothing, he laughed bitterly and shook his head.

"I'm still with my brother. I never wanted you to die. However, if I analyze it calmly, since my brother, who has always been in the opposite position, has passed away, I will be the crown prince now."

At his meaningful words, I turned my head in a faintly.

in a short

Rina, wearing an antique white robe and white robe, and her followers began to slowly walk into the crematorium.

In a solemn atmosphere, the occasional noisy atmosphere of the audience began to calm down as if it had poured cold water.

Booooooooooooooo!!

It was not long before all the knights in armor sounded a heavy trumpet in unison, and everyone who came to attend looked down without a word.

Even if he is not sad, he is imitating the crown prince, not others.

Ring!

It was not long before the quiet ritual without lines began.

This is how all the funerals affected by the Holy Land, including the Palan Empire, are held.

Before cremating the body, the new bride comes and dances to mourn the soul's death. They pray and dance for the spirit to die and be held in God's arms.

Lina's body was not actually that flexible, but everyone could feel the sincerity of mourning for the lion even in its stiffness.

Ring!

A cluster of pure white light began to appear around her, with the Shin Sung-seok on her staff and the bells on its underside.

In the light of the light, the lines of light left her and began to spread widely around the crown prince's body. Soon he climbed up to the sky and made his tail long.

It is the sound of the law and the rattling bells that come from a dim and solemn atmosphere like rain.

In it I saw Illinois with her mouth shut silent and her eyes red.

The stillness of the cremation seemed to last.

When the ritual of soothing the soul ended, the body had to be cremated.

but

"Ah...oh...oh,no...no.

After the ceremony, there was a problem with the resignation of the saint candidate Lina.

It was because Illina rushed in, grabbed the body, and began to cry, beating out the knights who came up with torches for makeup.

"Oh...oh, my brother! Open your eyes, brother... ..hehehehehe, I'm sorry. I... ...I've done everything wrong, so I'll stay with him for a little longer. Open your eyes. Please... What? Brother!"

"You can't do this. Your Majesty the Emperor!

"Let go of me!" Brother, brother! It's my fault! Because I've done everything wrong... ..hehehehehe."

It was not impossible not to understand her wailing heart, leaving all rational logic alone.

Mother! Please open your eyes! Please, don't die! You promised to live with me for a long time!]

The sight of her crying without caring about the eyes of those who were surprised by her crying and hugging the cold face of the crown prince without letting go of the body made the viewer feel bitter.

You look... ...not good.

"I have a good memory."

It's already been a thousand years since Hon remembered it.

However, the memories of that time were almost traumatized and could not easily shake off the bitterness.

An incurable wound doesn't heal. You said you'd cover it with time.

Perhaps the evidence is that you still feel bitter considering what happened then.

It was a few years later that I realized the memory of my past life. If he had memories back then, could he have prevented the situation? I also wanted to.

"Let go of me, brother! Brother! This is Illina! I'm Ilina, my brother who was so fond of me! Please..."

As if crying out for all the tears they had endured so far, the female members of the bureau turned their eyes to the point where their eyes were red.

Even men who are more sensitive than women are about to turn their eyes and sigh, so what is more bitter about the scene?

"Hmm... ...don't do this. If you cry like this, the Prince will not be able to leave with a good heart."

At the words of Lina, a saint who stood up with tears in her eyes and hugged Illina and pulled her back, she burst into tears as she was dragged out of the crematorium.

"No! There's a lot I haven't told you yet! I haven't said a word of "I love you" because I'm shy, but I can't send it to you like this!"

Her desperate resistance was beyond the reach of Lina's saint, so it was her Whitebird knights who eventually came forward.

"Lord, forgive my rudeness."

"Let go of me! I could throw all of your throats away!"

"Hit our throats then!"

Salivan nodded his head with a firm face over the knights who walked away carrying Illinois firmly.

Then the knights slowly climbed up and lit a thin branch and flint.

"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

Illina, who collapsed in a scream, tries to jump back into the fire.

Slap!!

Salivan eventually approached her and slapped her on the cheek.

"You stupid thing!"

"......"

Salivan finally put his hand on the sword and clenched his teeth at the sight of her staring at Salivan with his teeth were clenched her teeth.

"Take lilina. Keep an eye out of the room until the director's done."

"......"

At his words, White Bird's knights looked embarrassedly.

"What are you doing? Are you ignoring my future crown prince, even though you are Knights of Illinois? If you want, I'll put you in treason."

a cold way of speaking

As soon as he refused, the knights closed their eyes when the life seemed to be cut off.

Then he stepped down in support of the quietly wailing Illinois.

"I'm sorry I didn't look good."

Answering with a calm face, he bowed his head to the participants, and some seemed surprised by the coldness they had imagined, but said nothing.

Soon after, the crown prince's body caught fire and began to burn.

I hit one hand in the air without a word.

Thuung...

With a light sound, lightly move the big cane from the fingertips and pat the floor! I hit him.

[7 Circle]

[Rain Custom]

He then put one talisman from the other hand on his index finger and middle finger and closed his eyes.

[The Author of the Masterpiece]

[Fire of the Spirit]

Immortal flames and rain from the sky.

It's dark, but it wouldn't have been rainy.

The sudden sound of rain embarrassed the participants, but fortunately, no one was caught in the rain because their place was covered with waterproof tents.

only

"This is all I can think about. I think I'll have to go over here. The fire won't go out. I pray that the soul will be safely held in the arms of the Lord."

"Thank you...."

Salivan, who was looking at the body in a torrential rain without a word, immediately.

Then he cupped his mouth.

Sorry?

"There are times when you have to hold back even if you want to cry. His royal family members are. Never mind.'

My tongue was filled by itself.

[Laughing]

The sound of forcing something to bear was heard until I got out of it.

* * *

The room where Ilina was detained was still magnificent as it was the room where the imperial woman stayed.

"Open the door."

My calm words covered the entrance with a window.

"No one should go in. Go back."

"Open the door."

The expressions of the knights were indignant at my words.

"Prince David. Aona is rude, but you can't let her into her room alone."

"Then have a good night's sleep."

As if the knights were embarrassed by my smile.

They opened their eyes in an instant and fell apart.

I'm sorry for them.

But it's a little hard to just leave it.

Garnish!!

What I saw as the quiet door opened was Illina sitting on a large bed, staring blankly at the rain outside the window.

"It's Jiri Palace."

"Davie..."

You'd be surprised by my muttering.

Illina turned to me as she looked at the rain outside the window with an empty look.

"Orabani..."

"One day, one dies."

"......"

I won't say "I'm sorry about this."

"...thank you. And I'm sorry. You didn't look good."

"When a loving family dies, anyone will be sad. It's no wonder."

Shoot me!

The sound of rain was heard in the quiet room.

"It's raining... ..or Bunny's tears. I've had a lot of things to say to you."

It was a cheesy expression, but she was not rational enough to sense such shame.

"What a fool, rain just falls when the water in the sky weighs more than a certain amount."

Her expression frown at my calm words.

"If you're trying to make me laugh, I'll give you two out of ten."

"I don't want to be funny. I didn't come here to see you shivering, so look over here."

With a calm voice, I clapped the talisman I had prepared on her forehead.

"Oh, my God! What are you doing?"

"You said you wanted to say something."

If you have something you want to say, you should say it when you have a chance.

"You must have a lot to say. It's five minutes at the most. Do whatever you want to say in it."

Illina's eyes opened wide as she tried to remove the talisman from my horse and flinched.

......

There was no answer.

"I am a predator. I've just been hijacking your soul in orbit for a while."

Although the word "highjack" is not available here.

I didn't mean to understand, and the situation was similar, so it wouldn't matter.

I had a hard time bringing his soul back.

After that, I warned again looking at Illinois.

"Beware, it's five minutes. After five minutes, there will be a problem with the other spirits that were in orbit with the crown prince's spirit. And your soul will be unstable."

She, who had been hardened by my words, muttered in surprise.

"Big... ..come... Bernie?"

As expected, I can't hear the answer. However, her voice must have reached her.

[8 Circle Black Magic]

[Voice of Salvation]

It was created in eight circles by a commander who desperately tried to save his dead lover.

It is a magic that beats in search of the very momentary law contained in the orbit of reincarnation.

Of course, the price is scary because it is not an area that human beings who are mortal can do.

Thanks to the nipples of the goddess Priya, who did not know whether she was trying to save her or showing off her position.

"Eh...Davie? Am I... dreaming?"

In an incredible voice, Ialina mumbled to the head, giving her a hard time.

She doesn't know how precious time is.

"That's why people should be nice when they're around. Don't forget, it's five minutes. Close your eyes and shut your mouth when the music is over. The moment you talk more, you'll be dead."

But I didn't do well in my mother's life.

It will always remain a lifelong regret.

I think Ilina and the already dead crown prince had a special friendship more than I expected, and if they would put a lifelong regret on spending their days without a word.

I'd rather have a strong cause. I can't help you once.

"......"

Leaving her unanswered, I sat in a chair in the corner of the room.

Then he rummages through the subspace. I took out a small flute and closed my eyes quietly.

"May the dead soul leave the road of relief and put down its memories and live a new life."

With a calm introduction, a low, heavy, yet easy note began to flow out.

"The real song isn't exactly the right genre."

If you don't do this, the souls of the hijackers will have seizures, so I have to calm them down.

Everyone, line up. I'll play a magic performance by a minstrel who once made you dance to your dead soul.

The magic is more stable against the human soul, but the only thing I summoned was a fire chicken, so it was a gums instead.

When the heavy but slow wedding song rang, Illina bit her lips tightly with her teeth, held back her crying and smiled slowly.

The first thing she wanted to show the departing person.

It was probably a smile, don't worry.
