The Manreb hero is coming back!

the ninth and sixth installments

Rich Claire Orpan was too talkative.

I have no choice but to be prepared because I can't believe that I've never been more than a fool.

The appreciation that I actually saw was more depressing than I expected.

Argh!!

The bright light around him pushed his power back to make him dizzy.

the last salvation of a wandering lamb

Do not force, but have a source of grace.

The man who served God puts a curse on himself in his body and rejects the flow that is the foundation of the world.

Because of this situation, I was well aware that I could not be loved even if I received attention.

Therefore, I would have thought that God had sent me the scar not to make me a saint, but to protect those who will be loved by God from the back.

Is this... is this how God treats his loved ones?

'You're bothering me.'

My expression hardened at the words in the suddenly printed status window.

"......"

Davey?

As the jewel on her head disappeared and her body began to return to the original sex candidate, Alice, my impression was grimaced.

I will turn my back on God. I shouted it out.

The shrapnel of God's will I called in forgave her.

I had her in my arms.

Of course, no proper power could come out.

Originally, it would have been a torch that burned her body to the ground.

"What is this? Is this how it's gonna turn out?"

I muttered as if I were grumbling, but I couldn't hear the answer.

"Huhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh...

Alice, lying on the floor, struggling and moaning, was definitely alive.

There was no sign of Dayan, the self-proclaimed commander, who was resurrected using her body as a host.

Disappear?

It's not even funny.

He has reached the end of his eight-circle.

Although I was caught in the trap of a trap, it was like that.

He's an immortal, so he can't die so easily.

There are two possibilities.

She hid so tightly that I couldn't find her.

Or run away to another host.

Another host?

"The force is divided. He's not supposed to be so helpless with power."

His power is threatening even if it is not the world'

If it is simply the power of one's own, it is a tricky enemy for me to prepare carefully and block the retreat and kill it.

"The enemy has been resurrected, and we've missed a golden opportunity to deal with that split soul."

You are selfish.

That's why I can't understand. They don't even try to understand.

God doesn't try to understand me either, he not understand me.

There's only a simple deal.

Oh... that's ridiculous.

"In the beginning, God is not human and not human."

What people usually mistake.

It is the fact that the Goddess of Priya is not a human god.

Clearly, there were some maids who served Priya during her lifetime. So? What are you going to do? It seems to her that there is a very low possibility that there will be another host.

Since he is a candidate for a saint or a woman, he has revived some of them, but he should never have opened his eyes again.

Puck!

I grabbed Alice by the collar and pushed her against the wall, and I faced her with a hazy stare.

"God abandoned you first?"

"......"

"By the way, the god has made a deal to save you."

"That's... ..."

At this point, the entire script of the flow began to be seen.

"I'll tell you a funny story."

Speaking calmly, her eyes slowly began to focus.

"A position like a saint or a saint is determined from birth. Not everyone becomes a saint and a saint just because they have a scar."

That's why I'm titled an honorary saint, but to be exact, I'm just a man who is God-tracked and not a true saint.

I wasn't born with God's attention.

On the contrary, the woman in front of her eyes was different.

"Kuluck... what is that?"

"And you and Lina were born blessed to be saints."

He was born with a diamond spoon in his mouth, and he wanted many things.

God gave the test to two candidates.

To see the nature of a man, he should throw himself into a difficult situation or give him power.

There are currently two gender candidates on the continent.

Rina and Alice.

In Lina's case, she took the test by throwing herself into a difficult situation, and in her case, she gave the latter the power.

"What should we do? God saved you, but I don't want to save you."

"Kill me. I have nothing left."

I reached for her face, which was murmuring as if I had let go, and raised the blue flames.

Prometheus, an eight-circle flame wizard.

In the past, the size of the magic was overwhelmingly reduced due to the bizarre manna confusion that spread around this area, but in terms of firepower, running at the top was not flame magic.

The size was different from before.

"Why would you stop him if he said he was dying? I'll let you go as painless as possible."

She closed her eyes at my calm words.

Whooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooh!

but

This shit wasn't the end of the story.

As if to cover it up, a group of white lights covered my hand and erased Prometheus, the magic of eight circles.

I was frowned upon by the divine power of the superior, neither used by me nor Alice used.

Don't kill me. Save me. Save me.

No voice was heard, but the will was clearly conveyed.

The divine power gained by gaining the attention of God and trading with God has been a drag here.

Of course, I know I can't be selfish because I've done something with my divine power.

I couldn't understand it.

"That's right. Really."

When I stepped back, my hands were scattered with an annoying voice coming out, she slowly looked up.

"What the... ..why?"

It was her muttering.

"Why are you saving me?"

"Don't ask me that. Because I'm upset."

"So far you have ignored all my prayers! I studied, tried and practiced desperately to live up to your choice! But when you cry so desperately, why do you make me feel more miserable now?"

I wasn't the person she yelled at.

It was a cry for God who didn't answer.

"There's only one difference between you and Lina."

The ability and talent to deal with the Holy Magic?

You got it wrong.

It does not fall under the conditions of a saint.

"Well, what is it, the outstanding appearance of others?"

"......"

"That's wrong, too."

She was silent about what I said.

As a result, in my view, Lina will soon be scarred. On the contrary, you don't know when you'll receive the scar. Find out the answer for yourself. And I think he's under some kind of illusion."

Speaking calmly and holding her by the collar, I waved my hand toward the co-spirited air with a faint light.

"You've never been loved by God since you were born."

Everything was protected. There was a way through all the difficulties.

Unlike the usual twist of a twist, she had a guarantee that she was God behind her.

Outstanding appearance, the power to save countless people, and the divine power to be called noble to all.

Many invisible forces and flows that she might not have known would have helped her.

When she accepted the spirit of the commander, Dayan, and provided her body to become a host, it was because of God's protection that her soul did not die.

"If you want, there's a way to get rid of that stupid love."

Speaking calmly, I grabbed her wrist and raised it, drawing the shape of a particle over her wrist with my finger.

He didn't shine because he didn't take any action, but he seemed to know what form it was.

It's a little bit funny for me with God's holy grail to suggest, but...

I'll do it if you want.

The goddess of Fries.

"How the Goddess of Priya turns completely so that she can't wrap you around."

"That's... ..."

"Then all the affection of God that has been conveyed to you so far will be lost. The protection and flow will disappear from your knowledge."

"What's that got to do with you?! In the end, the protection was lost in front of you!"

"You're funny and you're in love."

Argh!

"Oh, my God!"

I told you not to kill him, but I didn't tell me not to touch him.

I looked at her coldly as I raised my cheek relentlessly.

"Was it my whim that just saved you?" Don't make me angry."

Since God's protection and flow cannot be helped, he stepped forward and intervened in it himself.

"It's simple that this hasn't worked out as you thought."

It's a test that you have to solve on your own without the protection of God.

"What you've been studying is what you've been doing to have the authority and dignity of a real saint among humans.

How do you interpret and accept God's will when you really have to study?

You said you don't know that you're lacking someone who's lived a full life.

That's the way it is.

"Think it over."

Pushing her back into the crack, I swept through the half-baked cavity without a word.

Can I leave this place alone?

It was a question from Persec.

Unless Dayan's existence has completely disappeared, it would be stupid to leave this place alone.

"I don't want to touch it."

The mind was in the present.

Throwing myself into a crack after her completely disappeared, I took a step forward as I saw the end of the forest with a blue sky and a wide plain.

"Lunne, run wild. Command all Decepticon squadrons."

"LÃ¼nne is on standby. I appreciate your combat capability very highly.

"Burn the entire contaminated forest. It is also annoying to purify with the torch."

For the time being, I don't want to use sacred power.

The goddess of Priya started first.

His remains remain and he is not completely extinct, but I didn't want to go beyond simple calculations to touch anything more.

When you're angry, each room is the answer.

Okay, let's use each room. Goddess of God.

You think I can't do anything if I don't use divinity.

I think you also received a lot of love from God.

"Well, maybe going to the gallery was the only affection I got."

Don't know how to die trying to get this power.

* * *

Most of the undeads who lost their owners after the demise of Claire Orphan collapsed on their own and returned to the ground.

On the other hand, there were undeads who simply roamed the body, but that itself was not a big threat to the Allies.

The only problem is the undead created by the commander, Dayan, who is believed to have not died yet.

Frost Warm Wyvern, who escaped alive.

And the super-powerful undeads that were asleep under the ruins.

Whatever it is, it would be a mess if only one ran wild.

Somehow they didn't see a single one.

As if he had fled to rally elsewhere.

Most of the enemy disappeared in an instant, so the Allies recovered the fortress without difficulty. I'm starting to worry about the post-processing problem caused by this.

In order to clean up the land contaminated with terrible fraud, it must be periodically purified by high-level purification magic or long-term subsexual purification magic.

The sex candidate Alice was ostensibly kidnapped by him and treated as being alive.

The best scenario was to fight him and die heroically. I was returning home alone with a word, but as long as she survived and God began to protect her and other gender candidates, including her, only I would be tired if I stepped forward.

inability to resist

the height of absurdity

It is challenging God's authority to never think about the heroes of the corridors who seem to smash the universe.

There is nothing more foolish and stupid than a creature's coming at its creator.

That is God, the will of the world.

At the moment when everyone was busy with post-processing, I laid my head on Persec's lap, where I had raised my body, and made a drowsy look.

It'll look like your head is floating in the air.

It's her legs that support my head as she says with a gentle smile.

If those who can't see her see this scene, my head will simply appear to be floating in the air.

"Let me be a little silly, too.

A sense of helplessness enveloped the whole body because the steam leaked out.

It's been a long time since I felt so annoyed and helpless.

Beep!

purification of contaminated land

"I won't."

Beep!

purification of contaminated land by force of forceful force

"Go ahead."

The status window was turned off annoyingly, but it shone again.

At the same time, the words changed again to the peculiarities of my information window.

purification of contaminated land the finishing touch of the horse's existence

"I won't. I'm going back to my in-laws for a while and I'm not going to do anything, so take care of it."

You know I'm dirty, and you know I'm not going to let it go, and now you're interrupting me at an important moment?

While snorting, I suddenly stopped at the unconventional suggestion that God's will had walked on.

"Oh, dear."

That's why continental spoons shouldn't be facing each other.

Unlocking the dead body due to the power of the water during purification.

"Losing is winning... ...jab. Unless you really like it, I won't take it."

I jumped out of my seat and strode away.

Looking at me like that, Persec murmured ridiculously.

"Look at the turn of events..."

The Manreb hero is coming back!

The 9th and 7th Episode

75. He who tries to prevent war and he who tries to fight war.

The snow flashes momentarily.

Davey?

To be honest, I don't feel a bit surprised because the conditions are so unconventional.

You're gonna change the rules of how you make the world a deal?'

the unlock of a messenger

The number of dead people is four.

And all of them are early human beings on other continents who have made a wish to protect themselves.

Of course, in the land of Thionis, there can be no magic or death.

I can't believe you unlock the messenger here.

In other words, I wondered what was different from the sound of suddenly making superpowers pop out of my previous life.

It's not impossible because it's the rules themselves. It wouldn't have been an easy decision to make even if it was God's will.

Davey?

Ferserk, who had been calling my name curiously, went back to his original small form with a bang.

Then he came up to me and tilted his head around.

What's wrong with you?

"... ...nothing."

Good. Not bad.

only

If it's an opportunity, I think I can rip it off more.

As soon as I thought about it, I could feel my mind spinning and dizzy.

I've experienced this before.

Davey? Davey!

Feeling the frightened Persek's cry slowly receding, I let go of my consciousness without resistance.

* * *

When I came to my senses, what I saw before me was the endless twilight of blue and the countless oddities in white clothes.

Wearing a white robe and huge white wings, they may be angels whose heart is projected upon them.

It doesn't exist, but when a deity without substance comes into contact with someone, it comes in the form most familiar to him.

Conversation is impossible, but there is definitely a will.

The presence, which had been silent and still with my hands on my head, soon began to gather light on the white hand, which had nothing, and soon held out a pale scarlet stone to me.

I knew what the stone was.

You've already received it once.

Beyond the dimming vision again, I could realize something soft was sweeping my cheeks.

* * *

"Did you hear about Prince Davy?"

"Oh, I heard. I heard. I thought you were unconscious. What happened all of a sudden?"

"Do you understand? It's just that, according to rumors... "

Someone's whispering gets closer, then slowly moves away.

"You said you went to the earth to punish the worst of this, didn't you? I think that's where they put a lot of pressure."

"Well... you looked pretty normal..."

"I don't know, but my insides were rotten by the herd, and I was hiding them as if they weren't."

"Oh, my God... ...why did he do that?"

"He's a saint. Do you know that? I don't know if he didn't want to bother him, or if he had other reasons."

"But you're a saint, so there's no bad reason, right?"

"I heard people with high motivation talking about it, but they didn't want to burden me, so they pretended they weren't sick."

"Oh, my..."

Due to his unruly sensitive hearing, his distant voice made him faint as if he were a lullaby.

"What's the big deal? Apparently Prince Davy didn't ask for any financial consideration when he joined the army, even though he jumped into the enemy camp alone and paid a huge reward."

"That's really, really great..."

As the eyes slowly opened, someone in front of me was surprised.

"Persek.

Davey! You woke up?

'How long have I slept?'

Four days...

He seemed to have overloaded himself.

Unintentional forced sleep is ridiculous.

Can't we do it once or twice?

God's will handed me something through the second reception.

Looking at the appearance, it was definitely similar to what I received the other day, but the feeling was subtly different.

"Yes, sir..."

"Wake up... ...you're awake!"

When I discovered the embarrassed women, I stopped them from running out, saying that I would call the doctor soon.

"Stop."

"But."

"I'm the doctor. I know my body well, so don't worry about it and go out."

Their faces were bewildered by my calm words.

"But... ..Lina told me to call her when she wakes up..."

"That's all right."

One of the maidens blushed slightly as she smiled.

"Oh... I see."

Eventually, when the maidens bowed down, the room remained silent.

"Successful in politics."

In the midst of all this...

"Don`t forget that all public opinion comes from the chats of the maid and the maid of honor."

I overlooked each of these public opinions.There will be a moment when your liver burns big.

No matter what you plan, you should expect all kinds of variables when you are connected to others.

Someone will do this in this situation.

If you gamble vaguely with that thought, it's a moment for you to humiliate yourself.

In my case, I can see how to act because I see the overall flow little by little, but it was actually difficult to judge by that alone.

On the sofa on the side of the room, two twin little girls were gently asleep, hugging each other.

And the silver-haired girl, whose red hair and blue hair had become a pillow, opened her eyes quietly closed and faced me.

At a very short moment, the silver-haired girl's hair was shiny and changed in shape and returned to its original form.

"David, the bio-signal is very stable, nothing unusual, the overall condition level is over 95%. an unprecedented figure of satisfaction This is highly appreciated by LÃ¼nne."

"Lune."

"Lune highly appreciates David's recovery."

I said nothing more in that relieved voice.

"Four days..."

Previously, the number of contacts, which had been lost for hours, increased to four days in the second time.

I don't know if the time increases as the number repeats, or if the fatigue accumulated due to the strength I used before that exploded.

I thought it might include at least all the front and rear.

Are you okay now?

"Yeah, it's much fresher."

Just as muscles grow when you use them, the more you use your body's mana, the more you increase the amount in unconsciousness.

The reality was that Manarang is gradually increasing at this moment, thanks to its continued proper operation.

My body, which had become in the best condition, became quite satisfied and moved around, I took my hand out of the blanket with the familiar sense of my hand.

Oh, my God... ...this looks like a small fire!

"It's a little different."

Unlike Persec, who opened his eyes wide, the stone, presumed to be a residual fire, was a little darker than before.

If you don't know, it's best to see for yourself.

As soon as she borrowed and dragged her powers, the item began to appear before her eyes.

[Cover]

[Breaking]

[One reconstruction when the user's body and mind collapses.]

[One remaining quantity]

[Automatic expression of whether to use special conditions.]

Hmm? Nothing much has changed.

"No, it's better."

It was amazing.

The previously used residual fire was clearly an automatic trigger in the fight against an enemy above the weight of the transcendental class.

However, this time, such items have not only disappeared, but also the collapse of the mind as well as the body has begun to be included in the scope.

And not a single resurrection, but a single reconstruction.

the word reconstruction

Isn't it quite familiar to me?

If you die, you're going to die.

"It won't just happen."

We'll need a lot of preparation for that.

As she said, it was worth risking one's life to gamble if he was looking for a change of heart.

My body has a deformed structure that is almost impossible to replace.

On the contrary, if you completely succeed in your transformation.

The fact that it will continue to grow as much as it did in the previous unstable transition period remains unchanged.

Then isn't it right to use it right now? You are now the world number and...

"No."

When I folded my mind, I immediately opened the subspace and threw it in.

Why is that?

"An unstable and complete transition is different."

After experiencing it once, we can see instinctively what will happen if we change further.

It's a means of recovery, or a catalyst for growth.

On the contrary, it is a huge bomb.

I slowly moved my arms and legs, bent my neck, and warmed up.

Then he said, moving his steps.

"My body is a compressed bomb now. If you use this as you want, you'll probably explode."

The scope will probably go far beyond what I imagine.

* * *

The condition of the gods, Sasin-su, is a symbol of desire created by humans who lived in other worlds without the existence of God's will to protect themselves.

Of course, as all forces come from Sasin-su, a collection of wishes, the difference between heaven and earth is whether the existence of Sasin-su can exist.

with a jerk

Soon after, as soon as I entered the union conference room, which was still busy with post-mortem problems, countless eyes reached me.

They are subtle boundaries, or eyes filled with surprises.

"Davie?"

"Prince Davy?"

Surprising voices were heard everywhere.

You've been lying dead for almost four days. Everyone seems to think you've gone too far with this.

'......'

Ha, it's not funny, they're now mistaken that you've driven away danger without taking care of your body.

It's an unintended misunderstanding, but...

That kind of misunderstanding.

Very good.

"I'm late."

"Oh... no! Are you all right?"

"I can't afford to take care of myself. I still have important work to do."

Some looked surprised at what I said.

It would be embarrassing if someone who thought he was selfish showed unexpected responsibility and commitment.

"What needs to be cleaned up should be cleaned up. It's what I can do, and if it's what I have to do, I deserve it. If you decide to take responsibility, do it until the end."

"Ha......but you haven't recovered yet......"

"I know my body well."

I say it here as if I were stubborn.

I'm not all right, but I can hold on.

You will know the meaning of it.

When he said something he didn't mean, he looked surprised everywhere.

In reality, I'm so lively that I'm flying around.

Can't you pretend you're sick?

"Oh, my God... ..Prince Davy... ..you don't have to go that far! The new recruits are purifying in the long run. A few years at the most..."

"In the meantime, if anyone exposed to the faintest fraud from the place gets sick. I'm saying I'm going to stop my innocent life from flying away."

"Prince Davy, you must take care of yourself! Although you are not a member of the Holy Land, you are the only one who received the scar."

"That's why I'm coming forward. He who is loved by God cannot be lazy."

Love? Funny sound.

Laziness? That's my favorite.

Prince Salivan mumbles as if he didn't know he would go this far.

On the one hand, as if impressed, the candidate Lina covered her mouth with one hand and opened her eyes wide, and people from other countries were surprised if they didn't know I would express such a position.

I don't expect it to be very effective.

To them, I seemed to be a saint who devoted himself to humanity without even checking my physical condition.

On the other hand.

"......"

Two people who know me very well.

Illina and Julis exchanged glances and sighed briefly.

"We're going to clean up the forest right away. Don't worry. Don't worry. If I step forward a little longer, everyone can be safe."

The response is very enthusiastic when I properly cut my mouth and gave up a bloody cough.

The reason I took this excessive overaction was not because of the people in front of me.

The main target is the knights, soldiers, or maidens from all over the world who look surprised and moved by my dedication.

Rumours are a word.

It spreads quickly and easily.

It is also a good way to exaggerate.

Just in time, this is the place where human figures from many countries gather.

A horse with no feet can go a thousand miles.

"Prince Davy! You haven't recovered yet after working too hard! You didn't want any financial or direct compensation in the first place, and you didn't have to do this."

"It's what I can and should do. If you leave it like this, many people will suffer. Human life is more important than reward, Prince Salivan."

When he spoke with a tired face, some even looked moved.

Among them, the most impressive looking idiot was none other than Prince Salivan.

Oh, you're so naive.

It's not their fault that your facial expression is too realistic.

It's his fault to be deceived.

* * *

Four... four... four...

the western part of the Palan Empire

Inyoung, wearing robes to a small desert area, was slowly walking.

"Mr. Jurgen, is this really a good thing?"

"Don't doubt what Sinmok's mother said that if you doubt it, it will be distorted from the ground up."

"But..."

E.L.F. is also a life. It's a corporation that can't live in luxury forever. Besides, if you can't avoid the fight with the man named Davy. Rather, we have to find the direction that will benefit the elf as much as possible."

"The Palan Empire is also the biggest country in the human world. Will they help us catch Prince Davy?"

"I must negotiate... ...for man is faithful to his greed, and if the Empire makes an irresistible offer, he will assist us."

"Well... if it's the Empire's position, it's more likely that the E.L.F.'s offer is more attractive than the prince of a small country you don't even know."

They didn't know.

In preparation for this situation, what kind of politics the prince of the small country is doing now.

The conversation between a calm elf man and a young elf girl completely disappeared after being buried in a dreary sandstorm.
209 # 209

The Manreb hero is coming back!

Episode 8 of the Nine

"Ilina."

a clean-up unit dispatched to clean up the completely burned forest

Saliban, who commanded a unit of most of the shrines and soldiers, called Illinois, which was staring at Prince Davy without a word.

"What's wrong with you? Brother."

Salivan smiled bitterly at her, who answered with a subtly stiff face.

"Are you all right?"

"Yeah, no injuries, no fatigue."

"Fortunately, if you were wrong, you wouldn't have been ashamed to see my brother."

Smiling, he stroked Illina's head.

"Didn't he spare you that much in his life?"

"......I can't believe he said that."

"Ilina."

"In the meantime, Salivan and I have been in conflict over everything."

Prince Salivan smiled bitter at Illinois' sharp comments.

I had a quiet clash with my brother. I actually fought with my brother a lot."

Having stopped talking, he mumbled with his glasses fixed to protect his tired eyes.

"However, I never wanted my brother to die or get hurt. It's the same for you."

"I'm just in a lot of trouble because of my brother's unruly drive."

At the quiet remark, Illina turned her head away.

"By the way, Prince Davy may be more true than I thought."

"......"

Salivan smiled at her, who looked amazing.

"What do you think?"

"What?"

"Prince David."

As soon as she realized what Salivan intended to ask, she opened her eyes wide, surprisedly.

"What is that?"

"I've looked into it one way or another. Prince Davy. It's amazing what he's been doing in a short period of time. To be honest, I can't ask for anything more if I can bring someone as big as him to the royal side."

Illina, who gave strength to the hand that held the sword, suddenly recalled the future when she made a marriage with the bad Davy and bore fruit.

"......"

"Hooray."

Salivan giggled as if it was fun for her to shake her head as if her face had become red without realizing it.

"I see your answer, I'll go over it when your brother's funeral is over. Aren't you old enough to save your wife? It seems like the Lindis Empire is already paying attention, but it's not a bad idea to have a hard time."

"Moreover, have you found your brother's body yet?"

"...yes, I've been searching everywhere, but I haven't had any good harvest yet. However, at this rate, you will be able to find your brother's body soon."

"......"

Salivan mumbled, hugging her, who had a shadow on her face, patting her back without a word.

"You'll be all right... ...and I'm sorry about what happened to you, but I don't want you to be depressed."

* * *

The cleanup operation itself was not difficult.

Even if it was contaminated in the first place, there were few difficult places in the cleanup itself because the period was short and wide.

If it were the only place, there would be ruins where they existed, but there was no reason to dig it up again as they had already been buried once through LÃ¼nne.

Public opinion about me starts to improve rapidly because of my actions to clean up the forest in a bad situation.

Jack had already heard that the rumor began to spread quickly through those who already had a big mouth.

Public opinion, which has begun to improve once, is meaningful even if it is simple.

Everyone's eyes clearly changed from before as they toured the forests and plains that were contaminated because it was not a difficult task in the first place.

It doesn't have to be hard to understand. I'm just moving in line with the deal you gave me with the Priya goddess.

Good deeds without cause for my actions He seemed to regard his body as a good deed.

a true saint

Or a saint.

It's a title that makes me feel quite embarrassed, but the fact that whenever such words are added, the debt of the Palan Empire will increase to me has not changed.

Most of the power that used to maintain the undead disappeared, right after the foundation of the undeads was over.

The coalition decided to disband after a brief meeting because it had no further purpose.

The procession back home was simple.

It was safe to say that the issue of posthumous compensation did not mean anything to the Allies as it remained in charge of politics, not those who fought.

Even in such a yard, I did not go back, but continued to purify the land of the Palan Empire, and to consecrate the spirit.

You don't have to do that. I didn't stop in spite of the dissuasion around me that I didn't have to overdo it.

You cheated in the first place, and it wasn't hard work.

I am not doing this for them, but I am faithful to the deal with the goddess of the Lord's Priest.

However, those who did not know the real intentions of such actions seemed to have mistakenly thought that I gave up my interests and remained to appease the souls of those who died unjustly.

"Prince David. Please drop by our kingdom sometime. I'll serve you with all my heart."

"Please take care of my kingdom, please. Apart from the simple struggle for interests, you are truly worthy of praise. It would be an honor to visit our kingdom."

Unlike those who like politics with a headache, those who are now favorable to me said the same thing when they left the headquarters and returned to their homeland.

He asked me to play it once.

Some of them were just polite, but some of them really had that kind of heart.

"Prince Davy?"

"Oh, yes, General Coulin."

"Haha, is it your first time talking to each other like this?"

An old man with a gray beard smiled and reached out his hand.

"I see. Are you on your way home now?"

"Yes, I can't leave my home country empty forever. I wish I could stay and help the prince more."

Laughing, he turned his head.

Then he pulled the arm of a young girl in armor.

"Inseok, what are you doing? It's not enough to thank the life-savior!"

Then he smiled, pressing down on the brown-haired girl's head to greet me.

"My name is Hula."

"Nice to meet you. This is Daviolan."

"Huh...hula Mendes. ...hahaha. Go... Thank you!"

I looked suspicious at the sight of him screaming with his head down.

"He was leading soldiers in the preface at the time of the command-line defense. The prince saved us from almost being killed by undead."

"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh..."

"Thank you very much. Inseok is now the only granddaughter I have left. It's the only family. I can't repay you much for your lack of energy."

He held my hand tightly, blurry the end of his words.

"I will never forget your kindness to save my precious granddaughter. Anyway, please visit us at any time in the Kingdom of Perdisha. I'll treat you with no regret."

"It is natural to save our troops in a war. Don't feel too much pressure."

He chuckled at my smile.

"Huh, I really think I know why the prince was stigmatized."

Fraud...

I hear someone's murmur, but I ignore it.

"I really wanted to say thank you. Please, take care of yourself. Let's go, Hula.

"Yes, Grandpa."

General Coulin Mendes wasn't the only one who turned around saying that.

"Thank you for saving my brother's life," he said. "I had a hard time raising up soldiers who were breathing and tightening their heads.

Some people thanked Frost Warm Weiburn, a huge undead who attacked the command, for saving his life.

Is it because those who were helped unknowingly became better than expected?

There were also many people who thanked me for my help, as if I had been encouraged to do good while leaving the country or individual gains alone.

'Simple goodwill or a warm atmosphere.'

Hmm?

'Not bad.'

If the other side is grateful, shouldn't it be polite to accept the favor purely?

After most of the cleanup work was done, I had time to relax, holding and releasing the remaining fire that had been mutated without a word in the accommodation.

"This is a bigger bomb than I thought."

If it explodes, how much will it fly?

"Well, I don't know, but theoretically speaking, it's a big bomb, but I don't know the extent."

By guess?

"I'm going to blow up a radius of dozens of kilometers."

So you're going to use it in the fight against the world?

Like when we fought with the former transcendental body.

I shook my head when asked if I was going to use it again.

"No."

It is said to be of great help to the transformation of the country, but this time it cannot be used simply.

"I'll leave this, I'll have to have an extra life."

Persek nodded sympathetically in my words.

Obviously, your behavior will cost you even a few lives.

I stopped here because I'm at a strong level now, but there's no guarantee that it'll be this easy in the future.

Currently, the level of force is incomparably low on the continent.

If the enemy buried in the past wakes up again in such a situation.

There is no guarantee that there will be no such thing as the current commander, Dayan.

"Let's start with Sasin-soo."

Then I got up from my seat and opened the tightly closed door without hesitation.

"Hot?"

At the same time, the blonde girl, who was thinking hard at the door with her head down, looked up at me in a surprise.

"What are you doing here?"

"Oh... well, it's..."

It didn't seem very important to see him talking gibberish like he was embarrassed.

Watching her without a word, I soon stroked her head and walked away.

"I need a few things."

She tilted her head at my words.

"What do you need? Just tell me! I'll save you all!"

Only then did she answer with strength as if she had come to her senses.

Therefore, I asked for the item I had thought of.

"I need to make some freaks. Or a window."

"The... the... the... the... the... the... the... what?

It was Illina who tilted her head as if she didn't know what it was.

Certainly, there can't be any amulet to make and use a monster paper here.

"Let's have a blank scroll ball, please."

an empty piece of paper which has not yet been enchanted

Ileina nodded quickly, even though she looked suspicious of my demands.

"I'll see if the distributor has anything left. But I don't know if there will be any extra supplies..."

Contrary to her concerns, I was able to get the necessary amount of ball scroll paper.

The necrotizing paper used to make amulets is often used to sprinkle the juice from the fruit of a tree and undergo various processing.

Of course, it was virtually impossible to find the highest quality rhubarb I wanted because such technology had never developed much in the Tionis continent.

I don't know if I grow it myself, but the reality is that it is impossible to secure the necessary supplies right away.

Of course, the type of work I'm trying to do has the greatest effect of necrosis, so the scroll paper used in magic has to be less efficient.

But, instead of this, it's called gum.

It was a professional law to make it impossible.

The scrolls of balls that Illina brought were larger than I thought.

"When you said you'd use it, they gave you a lot, didn't they? I'm starting to think that the imperial family in this country is you, not me."

"I'm glad you're quite friendly."

"Huh? It's not funny. You haven't forgotten what this command is called, have you?"

a true saint

a devoted saint

Whatever it was, it was cheesy but not bad.

"It's crazy that I didn't spare my life and worked hard for the people who were injured and died unjustly. Anyone who knows your true character will sigh first."

"Go back if you're going to talk rubbish."

"What the hell did you ask me to scroll the ball for?"

At her words, I opened a scroll without a word and began to draw a strange pattern on it with a thick pen.

"Good thing."

Even though I say so, my hands don't rest. Illina looked down at the paper with a curious look as a familiar and unusual pattern was engraved on the scroll to see if she had a good memory and had lost her senses.

"It's not like normal magic scrolling."

"It's different. It's not magic."

"Is it weird again? How many tricks do you have?"

"Are you curious?"

Her expression cooled down at my question.

"Keep wondering."

Illina said what I had to say in a timely manner as if she knew me well.

"I knew it, you bastard."

"What a quick wit."

The only reason for the use of scrolling was simply that the use of force required impurities-free paper with fewer side effects.

I quickly created a tropical number of amulets as if they were being machine-printed, and soon I grabbed the amulet's ink before it dried up and threw it into the air. If the goddess of Priya had kept her promise with me and unlocked her.

There will be a reaction.

"The paper just flew up."

"It's a summoner."

To make sure that the rules that really make up the world have changed, there is no better way than summoning them yourself.

"Birds, lizards, turtles, cats."

Illina tilted her head curiously at what I said.

"A bird... ..what?"

"What do you like?"

"I like birds, so to be exact. birds flying in the sky You look free, don't you?"

"It's a fire chicken."

I waved one hand to the shameless answer.

"Present under my name."

You have no right to veto.

Boom!!!

Soon there was a huge movement of fire along my hand.
209 # 209

The Manreb hero is coming back!

Episode 8 of the Nine

"Ilina."

a clean-up unit dispatched to clean up the completely burned forest

Saliban, who commanded a unit of most of the shrines and soldiers, called Illinois, which was staring at Prince Davy without a word.

"What's wrong with you? Brother."

Salivan smiled bitterly at her, who answered with a subtly stiff face.

"Are you all right?"

"Yeah, no injuries, no fatigue."

"Fortunately, if you were wrong, you wouldn't have been ashamed to see my brother."

Smiling, he stroked Illina's head.

"Didn't he spare you that much in his life?"

"......I can't believe he said that."

"Ilina."

"In the meantime, Salivan and I have been in conflict over everything."

Prince Salivan smiled bitter at Illinois' sharp comments.

I had a quiet clash with my brother. I actually fought with my brother a lot."

Having stopped talking, he mumbled with his glasses fixed to protect his tired eyes.

"However, I never wanted my brother to die or get hurt. It's the same for you."

"I'm just in a lot of trouble because of my brother's unruly drive."

At the quiet remark, Illina turned her head away.

"By the way, Prince Davy may be more true than I thought."

"......"

Salivan smiled at her, who looked amazing.

"What do you think?"

"What?"

"Prince David."

As soon as she realized what Salivan intended to ask, she opened her eyes wide, surprisedly.

"What is that?"

"I've looked into it one way or another. Prince Davy. It's amazing what he's been doing in a short period of time. To be honest, I can't ask for anything more if I can bring someone as big as him to the royal side."

Illina, who gave strength to the hand that held the sword, suddenly recalled the future when she made a marriage with the bad Davy and bore fruit.

"......"

"Hooray."

Salivan giggled as if it was fun for her to shake her head as if her face had become red without realizing it.

"I see your answer, I'll go over it when your brother's funeral is over. Aren't you old enough to save your wife? It seems like the Lindis Empire is already paying attention, but it's not a bad idea to have a hard time."

"Moreover, have you found your brother's body yet?"

"...yes, I've been searching everywhere, but I haven't had any good harvest yet. However, at this rate, you will be able to find your brother's body soon."

"......"

Salivan mumbled, hugging her, who had a shadow on her face, patting her back without a word.

"You'll be all right... ...and I'm sorry about what happened to you, but I don't want you to be depressed."

* * *

The cleanup operation itself was not difficult.

Even if it was contaminated in the first place, there were few difficult places in the cleanup itself because the period was short and wide.

If it were the only place, there would be ruins where they existed, but there was no reason to dig it up again as they had already been buried once through LÃ¼nne.

Public opinion about me starts to improve rapidly because of my actions to clean up the forest in a bad situation.

Jack had already heard that the rumor began to spread quickly through those who already had a big mouth.

Public opinion, which has begun to improve once, is meaningful even if it is simple.

Everyone's eyes clearly changed from before as they toured the forests and plains that were contaminated because it was not a difficult task in the first place.

It doesn't have to be hard to understand. I'm just moving in line with the deal you gave me with the Priya goddess.

Good deeds without cause for my actions He seemed to regard his body as a good deed.

a true saint

Or a saint.

It's a title that makes me feel quite embarrassed, but the fact that whenever such words are added, the debt of the Palan Empire will increase to me has not changed.

Most of the power that used to maintain the undead disappeared, right after the foundation of the undeads was over.

The coalition decided to disband after a brief meeting because it had no further purpose.

The procession back home was simple.

It was safe to say that the issue of posthumous compensation did not mean anything to the Allies as it remained in charge of politics, not those who fought.

Even in such a yard, I did not go back, but continued to purify the land of the Palan Empire, and to consecrate the spirit.

You don't have to do that. I didn't stop in spite of the dissuasion around me that I didn't have to overdo it.

You cheated in the first place, and it wasn't hard work.

I am not doing this for them, but I am faithful to the deal with the goddess of the Lord's Priest.

However, those who did not know the real intentions of such actions seemed to have mistakenly thought that I gave up my interests and remained to appease the souls of those who died unjustly.

"Prince David. Please drop by our kingdom sometime. I'll serve you with all my heart."

"Please take care of my kingdom, please. Apart from the simple struggle for interests, you are truly worthy of praise. It would be an honor to visit our kingdom."

Unlike those who like politics with a headache, those who are now favorable to me said the same thing when they left the headquarters and returned to their homeland.

He asked me to play it once.

Some of them were just polite, but some of them really had that kind of heart.

"Prince Davy?"

"Oh, yes, General Coulin."

"Haha, is it your first time talking to each other like this?"

An old man with a gray beard smiled and reached out his hand.

"I see. Are you on your way home now?"

"Yes, I can't leave my home country empty forever. I wish I could stay and help the prince more."

Laughing, he turned his head.

Then he pulled the arm of a young girl in armor.

"Inseok, what are you doing? It's not enough to thank the life-savior!"

Then he smiled, pressing down on the brown-haired girl's head to greet me.

"My name is Hula."

"Nice to meet you. This is Daviolan."

"Huh...hula Mendes. ...hahaha. Go... Thank you!"

I looked suspicious at the sight of him screaming with his head down.

"He was leading soldiers in the preface at the time of the command-line defense. The prince saved us from almost being killed by undead."

"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh..."

"Thank you very much. Inseok is now the only granddaughter I have left. It's the only family. I can't repay you much for your lack of energy."

He held my hand tightly, blurry the end of his words.

"I will never forget your kindness to save my precious granddaughter. Anyway, please visit us at any time in the Kingdom of Perdisha. I'll treat you with no regret."

He chuckled at my smile.

"Huh, I really think I know why the prince was stigmatized."

Fraud...

I hear someone's murmur, but I ignore it.

"I really wanted to say thank you. Please, take care of yourself. Let's go, Hula.

"Yes, Grandpa."

General Coulin Mendes wasn't the only one who turned around saying that.

"Thank you for saving my brother's life," he said. "I had a hard time raising up soldiers who were breathing and tightening their heads.

Some people thanked Frost Warm Weiburn, a huge undead who attacked the command, for saving his life.

Boom!!!

Soon there was a huge movement of fire along my hand.
210 # 210

The Manreb hero is coming back!

Nine volumes and nine episodes

The density of mana, which is abundant in the Tionis continent, is very high.

Compared to the world's standards, which used to be on the high side of Manna on average, the figure was nearly 10 times, so this was the world where all humans lived with Manna to some extent.

Of course, with Manna, it's a little different from the fact that Manna is rich.

"Something's... something's frustrating..."

Illina's response to complaining about the subtle frustration of her stomach was normal.

When there is a lot of smoke in a clear place, people who live there naturally realize that the air has become strange.

Illina's expression gradually frown as new forces, which did not exist in color, sound, or smell, began to dominate the area.

"Davie! What the hell are you doing?""

Instead of answering her gasping question with her chest clenched, I called LÃ¼nne, who had a silent, expressionless face.

"Lune."

Instead of answering, he looked at a guy with a small head and asked for a simple request.

"Go get some gas. Put it in a pot so that it can boil. If it takes a lot of work, I'll get some help."

"Lunne, with very high muscle strength figures, determined to be very suitable for David's command. This is highly appreciated by LÃ¼nne. We don't need any help."

The guy who talks with his slender arms twirling looks like he's just being brave.

Even if it looks like that, it has the muscle power to hold hundreds of kilograms in one hand and swing them around.

LÃ¼nne is.

It's biological golem in the first place.

You might have wondered what I said, but LÃ¼nne didn't.

"Yes, highly appreciated."

He was thirsty for praise even in peacetime. I'm not asking for that kind of compliment simply because you want me to praise you.

LÃ¼nne wants you to trust her completely.

"Who do I trust more than LÃ¼nne?'

That's not it.

My compliment was satisfactory, and he blinked his eyes and quickly disappeared.

"It's called magic."

"Do... alcohol?"

"To put it simply, it's a force that humans have created to protect themselves."

If the Elves are a good spiritist.

Man has the presence of magic.

Aren't we getting too much?

So there was no magic in the land of Tionis, where God exists.

Manna is thin. Threats are coming from all sides.

There is no God to protect.

Humans had to emulate the power of other races to survive.

It's human race characteristics to copy and make something.

The hero who taught me magic was a man of the world like Cheonma Dokgojun, who taught me martial arts and swordsmanship.

However, unlike the land mass where Dokgojun lived, he came from the continent where monsters were prevalent.

In order to overcome the miserable reality of humans, which is almost extinct, the old books borrowed and combined the records left by their ancestors to create something called magic.

Sasinsoo is in a sense similar to an artificial spirit.

If Noah, the Spirit King, saw them, it would have been obvious.

Whoo...

"Huh?! It's hot!"

In the sudden heat, Illina faltered a couple of steps.

The huge fireball heated up the surroundings as if it were showing its true character, and soon began to make huge flowers made of flames in the air as if it had its own will.

Although the buds are still in full bloom, the summons itself began to feel quite successful.

"Fireworks?"

"Um......."

She asked with a more comfortable face as she pulled Illinois behind her back to prevent exposure to heat and pulled up the power inside her body.

"It's done."

"The power that only humans have..." I've never heard of this."

"Very far from here."

She looked at me with round eyes at my explanation.

"In a land without God, mana was the only power that man could handle."

It is extremely rare, so it takes decades of training to produce only a few years of training here.

"That's the land?"

"Yes."

"That can't be... ...no matter where you go on the land of Tionis, there's no shortage of manna. On the contrary, the mana density of the land we're on right now is on the low side."

Her question was natural.

"It's because I'm not a Tionis."

"What are you talking about?"

She sighed as if she thought I was talking nonsense.

"So? That's what he built to protect humans? It looks like it's just a flower made of flame."

At the same time as the question began to change.

The tightly rolled buds slowly spread out, and the red flames began to swim like a giant electron movement.

And

When the buds that were emitting light in the hot heat were in full bloom.

"Oh... it's beautiful."

In front of her, a giant firebird that looked 10 meters tall revealed its grandeur and let out a huge roar.

Gosh, geeks!

"Oh... it's dirty."

However, apart from Ilina, who was staring blankly at the masterpiece of the flames, my face was frowned endlessly.

Fireworks that shoot out senselessly, and a huge roar that signals my existence.

When I compare the habits of the masterpieces I know.

He is as scared as he is just born.

* * *

Gosh! Gosh!

As the roaring of the giant flame-covered bird continued, Illinois closed her ears and frowned slightly, probably because of a headache.

"I can't believe it."

At the same time, lift the amulet between the index finger and the stop to raise the force.

Everything that is done by magic must be done by magic.

The act of simply burning an amulet.

At the same time, the red flame burns the scroll and the color begins to turn pale green.

Flaming!!

[grade 3 amulet.]

[Dr. Park's seal]

The lower the number, the better, so the lower the grade 3, the lower the level.

Even if he is just born, he will die.

As the power from the beginning is not normal, it should be this much.

Slurping!!

As the talisman burned for a moment and the huge chains began to roam around me, I blew it away without regret and tied the whole body of the masterpiece tightly to the floor.

Sigh! Sigh!

"Davie? What are you doing?""

When I tied up the person I summoned and threw him away, I heard a voice of surprise.

If we don`t catch it from the beginning, we won`t be able to catch that fire maniac."

"F... ...fireproof?"

"The character of a masterpiece is very dirty."

If he grows up and his personality hardens, then there will be no answer.

Of course, there's no business in front of the cane.

Is it necessary to endure such a nuisance?

Sigh! Sigh!

The man, who was stuck on the floor and roared at me, began to have flames in his mouth to attack me like that.

The human desire to create a masterpiece is a stark anger.

As much as it was made out of that anger, he has a unique temper.

Anger control disorder.

It would be the master's ability to use magic to turn this into [good anger control].

"It's noisy."

Gosh, geez!

As soon as the huge ultra-high heat of the brain was released to me with an angry roar, I took out another charm and burned it as if I had waited.

[3rd Class Amulet]

[Solars]

Paang!!

As if he had not existed from the beginning, his body was once again greatly shaken by the flame brain that disappeared for a moment.

Even if it's a masterpiece that lives on its own merits, it's a new series of wishes.

It wouldn't have been difficult to feel that something was going wrong as a clever artifact.

In an instant, I took out two more amulets and threw them into the air to pressure him.

Coooooooong!

Beep... ...beep- Beep!

At the same time, something intangible began to weigh on his body, and eventually the desperate cry of a dying bird came out of his mouth instead of the intense roar.

"Come on, my buldak, you'll get in trouble if you don't listen."

When I approached him and reached out my hand, the flames were reflected.

It's bound to be ridiculous.

The noble Shin-su is being held and lynched by a summoner, so it is just amazing for Shin-su.

It seems as though I am trying to stop him from approaching me by somehow pulling up the flames, but I ignored his resistance and put an amulet on his head.

"It's a seal, you bastard."

Slap!

Gosh, geez!

The flames that had been burning all over the frightened and struggling body slowly begin to extinguish.

At the same time, all he had left was shiny red feathers.

Crying... Crying!!

He somehow complained of injustice, saying, "I can't do this," but he seemed to be not up to the point of having a conversation like a young rookie who was just born.

"Davie, the oil cooker I told you about is complete."

Just in time, LÃ¼nne said, dragging a large cart with one hand.

"Well done, LÃ¼nne."

"Lune, very laid back work. More mission accomplishments are possible. value this highly"

"Yeah, right now, just look around."

"I think you're very low."

With his mouth pouting and backing away, I made eye contact with the masterpiece again.

"Our fire rooster."

Yikes!!!

He struggles as if not to call it by that name.

"I need your strength."

Instead of answering, it was an angry roar.

"I know you're easily angry and proud, but if you don't listen to me like this, I'll get in trouble."

Smiling, I tapped him on the head and stroked him gently.

Then he gently stroked his beak and his body began to tremble.

You think I've dealt with young rookies once or twice.

[Davie, remember this] Shin-soo, you know. have a very foul temper Hyunmoo bites at random, Blue Dragon is ferocious, Baekho has a nasty temper, and among them, the masterpiece has the best anger control disorder.]

Having a good memory is good in many ways.

So the first thing you need to learn to deal with is how to kill Shin-soo's energy when you summon him for you one day. Look at me. I let you go, and you're going crazy.]

"Like a brother?"

[You bastard!]

The best solution for the mastermind is to destroy his pride.

Although it is the masterpiece of fire.

The body of the man who lost the fire is not completely resistant.

"My Rooster, if you don't listen... "

After I stopped talking, I sent Mana into the pot that LÃ¼nne had brought, coated it, and raised the temperature.

At the same time, the oil in it started to boil all at once and start to emit hot heat.

"I'm going to twist my neck and pluck out all the feathers and make it chicken."

chicken

I don't know what you mean, masterpiece. The movement of the fire rooster flickered very momentarily.

"Well, why don't you take an oil bath? It can be fried very hot."

...Kiss!!

I'm struggling not to talk nonsense, but I already have the initiative.

"What? No seasoning? Don't worry. I'm good at cooking things that don't bother me."

As I ate anything I could, the taste naturally dropped to the level I gave up.

One of your ideal types is a woman who cooks well. That's where it comes from.

Ignore it.

Gosh, geez!

It seems like I was screaming with a different intention, but I kept ignoring his words and grabbed his wings and dragged him slowly to the oil cooker.

"You're not going to listen? There is nothing I can do. Our fire rooster. I'm sorry, but I'll cook it deliciously. They'll make it very spicy."

With a blue face, the rooster began to struggle crazily as it got closer to its thick skin.

Boom!

And when the distance is a little closer.

I kicked the pot as if I had made a mistake and spilled some of the oil right next to the fire chicken.

It was a scene where I thought the bird's eyes could expand like that.

I thought I'd listen to you if I did this way.

Crying?!

"Oh, no... there's a little bit of oil?"
