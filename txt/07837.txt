After a while, people from the town arrived at Hu Zhi's yard. Hu Zhi did not ask them to work immediately, but asked them to wait in the yard first. When everyone was almost there, Hu Zhi said to everyone: "Okay, everyone is here. This time I called everyone over. I think everyone knows why. I have talked to everyone before, and everyone agreed to follow us, so I am no longer polite. .”

He paused for a moment and then said: "For so many years, our life in Linyuan Town has not been very good, because we have no way to enter the endless abyss to hunt for treasures, because none of us are very strong. , if you want to go out to collect medicine, there are many places where you can’t go, so our income is very low. The reason why I will gather everyone together this time is because I want to concentrate all our efforts. Get up, so that we can become stronger, go to more dangerous places to collect medicine, and earn more spiritual stones."

"Everyone agrees to follow me. Then even if you are a member of the Gujian Gang, I can't treat you badly. Now we don't have much money in our hands. If you want me to give you too many good things, I won't I can’t afford it, so today I will give each of them a set of clothes to express my feelings. From now on, we will all go out to collect herbs or hunt together. The spiritual stones we get will be divided into ten parts, two of which will go to the gang. Under unified management, the remaining eight shares will be taken out and divided into different proportions of spiritual stones according to what everyone is doing. I have already told everyone about these, so I won’t say more. From today on, we Everyone has to work hard in one place, but I don’t believe it. All of our combined efforts can’t make our lives better. Come on, everyone comes to me to get clothes now, and then we will Let’s do our first job first, build our own canteen. In the future, everyone can come to this canteen to eat without having to pay for it. Of course, if the food in the canteen is not delicious, then you can go back to your own home to eat. I won’t care about this.”

As soon as Hu Zhi finished speaking, he was greeted with applause from all over the sky, and everyone's faces showed excitement. Although Hu Zhi didn't give them many things now, only one piece of clothing, but this suggestion The matter in the canteen is a big deal, which means that their food problem will be solved in the future.

After everyone received the clothes, Hu Zhi immediately divided the work among everyone. Some people went to collect stones, some to cut down trees, some to build foundations here, and some to collect grass. They did not have tiles here. , so the roof of the house still has to be paved with grass. This is the so-called thatched house.

Hu Zhi was still very capable and arranged work for everyone. Only Zhao Hai was fine. Zhao Hai still had to look after the children. After the children woke up, Zhao Hai led the children directly to the town. In addition, they plan to go further today and hunt more prey. Their house will be almost completed tonight, and the people in the town will eat in the canteen. There will be no meat to eat, and they will always look unhappy. Great.

The children also seemed very excited. They might not know what everyone was doing, but what was the use of doing it? But when they saw so many adults busy there, they would be very excited. Zhao Hai took them out of the town and left. After walking a long distance, they entered the woods, and then it was time for the little black demon's performance.

But today Zhao Hai also took action. He also hunted some, but he didn’t hunt too much, just enough to eat. However, he picked a lot of wild vegetables. There are many kinds of wild vegetables in the woods, which are edible. There were a lot of things, and they picked a lot. In the evening, Zhao Hai was going to make some stir-fried vegetables.

Just when Zhao Hai left the town, the whole town became busy. The stone pickers started to collect stones, and the grass cutters started to cut the grass. After the grass was cut, it had to be dried, and there were people Everyone was busy cutting down trees, making tables and chairs, and making frames for building houses.

The reaction of the people in the town also surprised the people in the big shops. However, after they knew that it was Hu Zhi and the others who were building the house, they did not ask anything. Hu Zhi and the others were in the town. The prestige is still very high. Now that Hu Zhi wants to build a house, it is normal for everyone in the town to help.

Zhao Hai and the others wandered outside for more than two hours before returning to the town and letting the yard go back to play in the yard. However, Zhao Hai went to one of the stores called Xuanming Armor alone. The name of this store, and the sign outside the store, tell you that this store is opened by Xuanjia Sect.

As soon as Zhao Haida arrived in front of the store, he was immediately greeted by a waiter. This waiter was very polite to Zhao Haida. Although this store was opened by Xuanjia Sect, most of the waiters in the store came from Linyuan. They were recruited in the town, so they all knew about some celebrities in Linyuan Town, especially Zhao Hai. So when he saw Zhao Hai, the guy was very polite. He cupped his fists at Zhao Hai and said: " It turns out that Mr. Zhao Ying has arrived. I didn’t know that Mr. Zhao Ying came to our store today, but do you need anything?" Although his words were polite, his attitude was not necessarily very respectful. On the contrary, his tone was filled with A hint of pride.

Zhao Hai knew that this was because this guy worked in the Xuanming Armor Shop, so he had such a hint of arrogance. Working in the Xuanjia Sect's shop, they thought they were superior to others. For such a person, Zhao Hai really He didn't have any good impressions, but he didn't have any enmity with these guys. They were just short-sighted villains. There was no need to argue with them.

Zhao Hai had also gone to this store to deal with some things before, and they were all special herbal medicines, so he was relatively familiar with the situation in this store. He said to the guy: "Man, I heard that your store I want to buy a jade slip about herbal medicine, but I don’t know the price?”

When the clerk heard what Zhao Hai said, his eyes lit up, and then he said: "It turns out that you are here for the herbal jade slips. You are really discerning. Our store has all the herbal medicines in Wanshan Realm." The jade slips with detailed descriptions are priced at thirty spiritual stones each." When the boy said this, he looked at Zhao Hai expectantly, because he knew that thirty spiritual stones would cost a casual person. For Xiu, it's not a small amount. If he can really make this business, he will definitely be praised by the shopkeeper, and maybe he will be rewarded with something.

Zhao Hai nodded and said: "Okay, take one." The clerk immediately responded excitedly, then went directly into a counter, took out a jade slip, and handed it to Zhao Hai. After taking the jade slip, he gave the spirit stone to the guy. The guy then reached out and scratched the jade slip, and a restriction on the jade slip was lifted.

The reason for doing this is to prevent people from buying the jade slips after reading the contents on the jade slips. You must know that monks learn from the contents of the jade slips very quickly. Maybe their mental energy is transferred to the jade slips. As soon as he checked it out, he had already memorized all the contents in the jade slips in his mind. If there were no restrictions, they would not have to sell their jade slips, they would just give them to those people, so this jade slip There are restrictions on everything. If someone wants to use their mental power to read the contents of the jade slips without removing the restrictions, the jade slips will break.

Zhao Hai took the jade slip and took a look at the contents. This jade slip was really not expensive, because the content inside was indeed very rich. There were many herbs in it, which Zhao Hai had never seen before. , there are some herbs that he has even seen in the woods outside the town. Although the price is not high, the quantity is not small. If they are all collected, the value is not small.

Zhao Hai put the jade slip away with satisfaction, then gave the clerk a fist and turned and left the shop. When Zhao Hai returned to Hu Zhi's yard, he found that several houses had been built in Hu Zhi's backyard. These houses were all very large. Now the general part of the house had been built, and everyone was laying tiles on the roof. Damn it, everyone has a smile on their face, they joke a few words from time to time, and they all look very happy.

Zhao Hai saw one thing from the faces of these people, and that was hope. The faces of these people all had hope. Looking at the looks of these people, Zhao Hai also had a smile on his face. At this time in the yard, There are also many people making tables and chairs. The tables they make are very simple. They are just square tables. The chairs are even simpler. Some are simply stools. They are all as simple as they come. Anyway, they are No one cares about the place where everyone eats.

Zhao Hai came to Hu Zhi who was busy and said to Hu Zhi: "Brother, it's getting late. We have to prepare dinner. We found a lot of prey today and asked people to take care of them. Make more meals. Let everyone eat together in the evening, but Aunt Wu alone will definitely be too busy. You divide the cooks first, and then they will be responsible for cooking." These things must be done earlier Make preparations, wait until the store is completely built, tables and everything are moved in, and when the hot meals are moved to the tables, everyone will be in a very good mood, which will more effectively improve everyone's cohesion. , so Zhao Haicai reminded Hu Zhi.

Hu Zhi nodded, and then he immediately named a few people. These people were all older women. The clothes they wore were not very good, and it seemed that their lives were not very satisfactory. Now they are all When Hu Zhi called them, they were a little confused and came to Hu Zhi uneasily.

Hu Zhi said to the women: "Aunt Liu, you guys will be responsible for cooking for everyone from now on. From today on, you will be under Zhao Ying's control. Now go to Brother Lan's yard next to you and cook for everyone." Prepare dinner, and when we finish building the house, we will have the first meal in this new house."

Hu Zhi's voice was not quiet. Everyone heard what he said. When they heard what he said, they all cheered. They all felt that Hu Zhi's words really spoke to their hearts. Aunt Liu and the others also They are very happy. They are older and have not practiced any advanced skills. Now their strength is not as good as before. In addition, some of them still have old injuries, so they can no longer take risks. Life is very hard. If they can do this job, their future lives will be guaranteed.
