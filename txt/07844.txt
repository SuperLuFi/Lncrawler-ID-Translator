When the shopkeeper heard Zhao Hai's words, he couldn't help but be startled, but then his expression changed. He looked at Zhao Hai and said in a deep voice: "Sir, what you mean is that all the medicinal materials in Linyuan Town are made from Your Ancient Sword Gang sells them all together? But what does this mean?" When the shopkeeper heard what Zhao Hai said, he immediately understood what he meant, so he said it directly.

Zhao Hai glanced at the shopkeeper, smiled slightly and said: "The shopkeeper is really amazing. He got to the point in one sentence. Now that everyone in the town has joined our Ancient Sword Gang, the medicinal materials and demons we have obtained Of course, the beast items will be handled uniformly by our Ancient Sword Gang, I wonder what the shopkeeper thinks?"

The shopkeeper glanced at Zhao Hai, then turned to look at Hu Zhi, and found that Hu Zhi was holding a cup of tea and sipping it gently, as if he hadn't heard the two people talking. His expression couldn't help but change. He couldn't even keep the smile on his face. Then he looked at Zhao Hai, took a deep breath, and said in a deep voice: "I don't know what you want to do, sir?"

Zhao Hai looked at the shopkeeper and couldn't help but smile slightly and said: "Our Gujian Gang has always lived in Linyuan Town, and we have cooperated with the shopkeeper a lot. Now our Gujian Gang has integrated the entire town, and it is also No, I just want to make everyone live a better life, and I have no other ideas. Shopkeeper, do you think we need to invite all the shopkeepers from the other three stores, and let us all discuss it together? "

Although Zhao Hai's words seemed to be asking, they made the shopkeeper's eyelids twitch. He took a deep look at Zhao Hai, then looked at Hu Zhi, and then he said in a deep voice: "You two, please sit down for a moment. I'll come as soon as I go." After saying that, he turned around and left the room, leaving only Zhao Hai and Hu Zhi in the room.

As soon as Hu Zhi saw the shopkeeper leaving, he was about to speak when he saw Zhao Hai wave his hand, then turned his head and looked around, then waved his hand to create a protective cover for the compartment, and then Zhao Hai said Then he said in a deep voice: "Brother, don't say anything now, we are here to negotiate." Hu Zhi nodded and stopped talking.

The two sat in silence in the room for about a quarter of an hour. Then they heard the door being pushed open, and several people walked in from the door. The leader was the fat shopkeeper. Behind him, there were also There were three people following, one dressed as a scholar and two dressed as warriors, but they looked very young.

After the four people entered the room, they all glanced at Hu Zhi and Zhao Hai. Hu Zhi and Zhao Hai also stood up quickly, clasped their fists at the four people, and said in a deep voice: "I have met the four shopkeepers." Of course they had to look at them. The other party saluted. Although they were here to negotiate today, if it was all about strength, they could not be the opponents of the forces behind these four shopkeepers, so they had to remain polite.

The four shopkeepers all returned the gift. After sitting down, the fat shopkeeper said: "Mr. Hu, Mr. Zhao, we are all businessmen. We came to Linyuan Town just to do business. Now All the herbal medicine and monster item business in Linyuan Town has been taken over by the Ancient Sword Sect, so naturally we have to talk to you. I don’t know what requests you two have, so please put them forward." The fat shopkeeper is always quick to talk.

Zhao Hai looked at the four shopkeepers, smiled slightly and said: "Our Ancient Sword Gang actually doesn't have any requirements. Our Ancient Sword Gang is just a bunch of hard-working people who gather together to beg for food, and this food is also rewarded by you." , of course we will not go too far. We invited a few people here today just to discuss the prices of those things. We, the Ancient Sword Gang, will not make any excessive demands, but there is one thing we hope you can agree with. , we couldn’t be more grateful.”

Zhao Hai kept his position very low. He knew very well that people from those sects were actually very good-looking. If you came up and showed off that you were stronger than them, then they would probably They will fall out with you right away. On the contrary, if you lower your attitude a little, they may feel better and agree to your terms.

As expected, the face of the fat shopkeeper softened slightly, and the faces of the others also looked better. The fat shopkeeper then looked at Zhao Hai and Hu Zhi and said solemnly: "If you two say that, then of course we have nothing to say. If you have any requests, please just say it. As long as it is not excessive, we can agree to it. After all, we have always cooperated very happily."

Zhao Hai said with a smile: "That's right, that's right, we have always cooperated very happily, so I can say whatever I want, and I am not afraid to tell you that we in the Gujian Gang are all poor and afraid, so We don't dare to make any excessive demands. We only have one request, that is, when we sell medicinal materials, we hope that the shopkeepers can give us a fair price. What do you think?" Zhao Hai said and directed at the four of them. He held his fist, but Hu Zhi didn't move. He just sat there, holding the teacup, which had completely blocked his face.

As soon as Zhao Hai said this, the faces of the fat shopkeeper changed. Then the fat shopkeeper looked at Zhao Hai and said in a deep voice: "I don't know what kind of price you are talking about. You know, Linyuan Town is the closest to the Endless Abyss, but there is no way to get any good things from the Endless Abyss. The performance of our several stores has not been very good, so the prices of medicinal materials are relatively low. Sir, please don’t say clearly what a fair price is.”

Zhao Hai looked at the fat shopkeeper and smiled slightly: "I also know this. The fair price I mentioned is actually the current price. If you can maintain the current price for transactions, then we will be grateful to you. Absolutely, of course, if the market prices fluctuate in the future, our prices will also fluctuate accordingly, what do you think?"

The fat shopkeeper and other shopkeepers couldn't help but relax when they heard what Zhao Hai said. They thought Zhao Hai was going to raise the price. It turned out that Zhao Hai was not raising the price, but just to maintain the current price. Then There is nothing more to say, and this can certainly be agreed upon. So the shopkeepers exchanged glances, and finally they all nodded slightly.

Although these people are also disciples of the sect, they have been doing business here for a long time and have become businessmen. If the Gu Jian Gang wants to raise the price, then they will naturally not agree, but now the Gu Jian Gang The gang is not raising the price, it is just to maintain the original price, so naturally they will not object.

When the fat shopkeeper saw that the others agreed, he turned to Zhao Hai and said: "Okay, of course there is no problem. Now the prices of medicinal materials and monster items in the market have been very stable, so keep The current price is very necessary. If the prices of these things in the market fluctuate in the future, our prices will naturally follow the market. There is nothing to say about this, and we all agree."

Zhao Hai smiled and said: "Okay, everyone agrees. Then let's talk about our distribution plan. Qingfeng Yangyi, Iron Arm Hengshan, Baishi Pharmacy, each has a share of two and a half floors, Xuan Ming The armor shop has one floor share, and the remaining one and a half floors will be bought to other small shops in the town. After all, everyone is making a living, and it is not easy. What do you think?"

As soon as Zhao Hai said this, the room fell silent, and even Hu Zhi was stunned. This was somewhat different from the shares they had discussed before. The shares they had discussed before were four of them, each with two floors. The remaining two floors were sold to other small shops in the town. Why did Zhao Hai change it and take away one and a half floors of the Xuanming Armor Shop at once? This seems a bit excessive, right?

Sure enough, one of the four shopkeepers stood up in a flash. He was not very tall and his skin looked dark, but he looked very strong. He looked strong. He was in his fifties and wearing a warrior uniform. He was looking at Zhao Hai with an angry look on his face, and then said loudly: "Zhao Ying, what do you mean, do you not take our Xuanjia Sect seriously?" He directly revealed his identity. Although everyone knew their identity, they usually would not mention it when making transactions. Now he directly revealed his identity, obviously angry.

Zhao Hai glanced at the shopkeeper. He knew that the shopkeeper's surname was Chen. He immediately said to shopkeeper Chen's fist: "Don't dare, don't dare. Our Gujian Gang is just a small gang, how dare you Look down on Xuanjia Sect, we have always respected Xuanjia Sect, why should we look down on it, Shopkeeper Chen is serious, very serious."

Shopkeeper Chen did not calm down, but stared at Zhao Hai and said: "You keep saying that you don't look down on our Xuanjia Sect, but you only give us a share of the first level of Xuanjia Sect. What do you mean? You If I don’t make it clear today, I will never let go of your relationship with the Ancient Sword Gang.”

Zhao Hai looked at Shopkeeper Chen and smiled bitterly: "Shopkeeper Chen, of course we have the same deal as everyone else, and before we came to Qingfeng Yangyi, we went to the Xuanming Armor Shop first. After we entered the store, we very politely asked the store clerk to invite shopkeeper Chen, saying that he had a big business to discuss with shopkeeper Chen, but the shopkeeper said that the shopkeeper was very busy and did not have time to talk to us. , and also said that there is really no business in a place like Linyuan Town. If the shopkeeper needs to be alerted, they can handle it. We thought that Xuanming Armor Shop did not want to trade with us, but now we see you, shopkeeper Chen, are here. , we just gave Shopkeeper Chen a share, but we are still frightened, fearing that you don’t want Shopkeeper Chen.”

As soon as Zhao Hai said these words, the other three shopkeepers all looked at shopkeeper Chen with strange expressions. Originally, they felt that today's incident was a bit strange. Here in Linyuan Town, their four shops are Xuanjia Sect's shops. Most importantly, people from the Xuanjia Sect took the lead in everything. However, for such an important cooperation this time, it was the Qingyang Sect that took the lead. This matter itself revealed a hint of weirdness. Now that Zhao Hai said this , they all understood. It turns out that it is because of you. It turns out that the Ancient Sword Gang has come to you a long time ago. It is you who don’t want to cooperate with them. If they don’t cooperate with you, then naturally it is the right thing to do. Put it in At that time, Xuanjia Sect was not interested.
