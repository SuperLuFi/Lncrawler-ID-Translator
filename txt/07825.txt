c7825 Tell

When Old Liu Tou heard Hu Zhi's question, he couldn't help showing a strange look on his face, and said to Hu Zhi: "Huzhi, come and sit down. After you left, a lot of things happened in the town. I slowly Let me tell you, as for your question about Little Lanka, he and his master went out for a trial and were not in the town. As for where they went, I don’t know."

When Hu Zhi heard what Old Liu Tou said, he was stunned at first, and then his face couldn't help but get excited. He immediately said to Old Liu Tou: "Uncle Liu, are you saying that Xiao Lanka is fine? He just went out for a trial. Go? Is he still alive? Still living in the town?" Hu Zhi was really shocked by the news, and he seemed very happy.

Before they left the town, Lanka had already disappeared. They searched for it for a long time but could not find it. If they hadn't focused on finding Lanka, Qiu Wanqian would not have had the chance to deal with him. From this point, we can see how much he attaches great importance to Lanka. Now that he heard that Lanka was still alive and still in the town, how could he not be happy? That's why he heard the news from Lao Liutou. Only when you are doing this, you will look so excited.

Old Liu Tou looked at Hu Zhi's appearance, waved his hand and said: "Come, sit down, I told you, a lot of things have happened in the town recently, I will tell you slowly, don't worry, Lanka and the others will definitely come back before nightfall. Are you coming back this time for revenge? You don’t have to worry about that anymore, Qi Wanqian and the others are already dead."

Hu Zhi also calmed down at this time. When he heard what Old Liu Tou said, he also took a deep breath, then sat down, then took a look at Old Liu Tou's shop, then smiled slightly and said: "Okay, Liu Uncle, the store has been expanded, and it seems that it has made a lot of money recently." Hu Zi was very familiar with Old Liu Tou before, and he also knew that Old Liu Tou had liked Lanka very much since he was a child, so he came to Lao Liu Tou Come here for news.

When Old Liu Tou heard what he said, he couldn't help but smile, and then said: "This shop is not all mine now, but also belongs to someone else. I'd better tell you what happened in the town. You are being Qiu Wanqian and the others plotted to withdraw from the town. Soon after, Xiaolanka came back. But he didn't know that he hadn't come back for a long time. He just thought he had slept. After he came back, he was still looking around. You guys, after finding out that you all retreated and Qiu Wanqian and the others took over your house, that kid was very angry and actually wanted to fight Qiu Wanqian and the others."

When Hu Zhi heard what Old Liu Tou said, although he knew that Lanka was fine, he became nervous. Old Liu Tou continued: "But I stopped him. I just asked him to return to his yard. Be careful. Qiu Wanqian and the others, under the care of the people in the town, and because Lanka didn't seem to know what they ate, they became very powerful, and he was that monkey, the little black demon He has also become very powerful and has mastered several kinds of magic. It is not something that ordinary people can deal with. It is precisely because of this that Qiu Wanqian has never dared to touch Xiaolanka. In addition, they also want to kill Xiaolanka. He got other things on his body, so little Lanka was never harmed, but those guys warned the people in the town that no one dared to help little Lanka. If anyone dared to help little Lanka, they would deal with him. It is precisely because of this that Xiaolanka suffered a lot during that period."

When Hu Zhi heard what Old Liu Tou said, his eyes couldn't help but turn red. He really didn't expect that Qiu Wanqian would do such a trick and not let the people in the town help little Lanka. He could Imagine what kind of life a young Lankan child lived during that period of time.

Old Liu Tou then said: "But this kid, Xiao Lanka, is really very clever. To be honest, I don't know what abilities he has. Anyway, he finally learned how to run to the town alone." He went out to look for food. At first, he just found some food. Later, someone tried to rob him, so he killed the person. Instead, he robbed the other person's things. After robbing the other person's things, he went out to look for food. , just bring it to my place to sell it, and then exchange it for food, but I’m not hungry anymore.”

When Hu Zhi heard this, his face couldn't help but become very ugly, and then he sighed and said: "It's us who are sorry for Brother Lan, and it's us who didn't take good care of little Lanka. These are all our faults, and little Lanka has suffered. "At this point, his eyes were already a little moist. Lanka is like his child. He has watched him grow up since he was a child. Now when he hears that Lanka has suffered so much, how can he bear it? Even a man couldn't help but burst into tears.

Old Liu Tou looked at Hu Zhi and sighed softly, and then said: "Actually, we are still a little worried, because Qiu Wanqian and the others were obviously ready to attack Xiaolanka at that time. I was We have also made preparations to unite with the people in the town to get rid of Qiu Wanqian and the others. After all, Qiu Wanqian and the others have been running rampant in the town in the past few months, which has attracted the attention of everyone in the town. If they are dissatisfied, as long as they add fuel to the fire, I think the people in the town will definitely deal with them, but it is a pity that we do not have this opportunity."

At this point, Old Liu Tou paused for a moment, and then said to Hu Zi: "Just about a month ago, one day Lanka went out to look for food, but did not come back for a long time. The next morning, waiting for him When he came back, he was followed by a man. The man called himself Zhao Ying. He was dressed as a casual cultivator and looked nothing out of the ordinary. He claimed to be Lanka's master and said that Lanka had prayed to him the night before. He became a teacher. After he brought Lanka to the small town, he first came to me to buy some clothes for Lanka, then went to Ke Lai Xuan for a meal, and then took Lanka back to his home. 's yard."

When Hu Zhi heard what Old Liu Tou said, his expression couldn't help but change, and his eyes flashed coldly as he said, "Does this person have evil intentions? If that's the case, I will cut him into pieces." Hu Zhi said about Lanka cares about him very much, so now when he hears that a stranger is approaching Lanka, he is naturally very nervous.

But Lao Liutou waved his hand and said: "Listen to what I have to say. Not long after Zhao Ying and Xiao Lanka returned to the room, they came out to ask me about Lanka's news, and Qi Wanqian Of course I told him their news, and warned him that it was best to stay away from Little Lanka, but he didn't pay attention, and then returned to the yard. The next day, Qiu Wanqian personally led his men Those guys went to block Zhao Ying. After Zhao Ying arrived outside the yard, the two sides didn't know what they said. They started fighting as soon as they disagreed. However, they didn't expect that Zhao Ying was very powerful and a physical cultivator. One person killed Qiu Wanqian and several of his men, and there were a few remaining people who all ran away when they saw something was wrong."

Hearing what Old Liu Tou said, Hu Zhi couldn't help but frown. He knew very well that body cultivators are all very difficult to deal with. The person following Lanka now turned out to be a body cultivator, and he also Qiu Wanqian and the others were all killed, which fully demonstrated Zhao Ying's strength. He felt that things were a bit tricky.

Old Liu Tou then said: "After Zhao Ying killed Qiu Wanqian and the others, he sent some leftover weapons to me in exchange for some spiritual stones, and then used those spiritual stones to buy some things, but most of them were Xiaolan After that, he started to teach Ranka how to practice in a simple way. Although he didn’t know what he taught Ranka, Ranka seemed very happy, and Zhao Ying was really kind to Ranka. It’s like treating Lanka as my own child.”

Having said this, Old Liu Tou paused for a moment, then he glanced at his shop, then smiled slightly and said: "Later, Zhao Ying came to see me, and he told me that he had two hundred spirit stones in his hand, which he could cast. When he came to my store, he became a shareholder and asked me to expand the store, but he wanted the two layers of dry stock in the store. He didn't want these dry stocks himself, but wanted to give them to Xiao Lanka, so that if he had anything in the future Things are no longer with Xiaolanka. Xiaolanka also has his own fixed income and will not be as miserable as before. I agreed at that time, so my store expanded. But now this shop is not just my own, it also has two floors of Xiaolanka dry stock." At this point, Old Liu Tou looked at Hu Zhi with a smile, wanting to see his reaction, and he also I'm really looking forward to Hu Zhi's reaction.

Hu Zhi did not disappoint him. When he heard what Old Liu Tou said, his face showed a hint of surprise. Then he frowned once, with a look of self-blame on his face, and then he lightly He sighed and said: "Blame me, why didn't I think of this before? If we had thought of this earlier, then Lanka wouldn't have suffered before."

Old Liu Tou looked at Hu Zhi's appearance, smiled slightly and said: "You guys have good hearts and good strength, but when it comes to management, you are far behind. After Zhao Ying bought a stake in my store, He started the second step of his plan. He used the yard of Xiaolanka's house to recruit children from the town to study there. He could teach the children in the town to practice, and he could also provide food and accommodation for those children. Each child He only received two spiritual stones, which didn't seem like much, but in fact he still made a profit, and he also secretly told me to let those children practice with Lanka from an early age, and let Lanka take care of them from an early age. Waiting for them, when Lanka grows up, and those children grow up, then Lanka will definitely respond to everything, and it will be equivalent to having its own power in the town, how about it? You didn't expect this, right? "

Hu Zhi was stunned for a moment, then looked at Old Liu Tou with bright eyes and said: "Is this method feasible? Will the people in the town send the children here? If it is really feasible, then this is a great thing. !" He knew very well that if it was really what Old Liu Tou said, it would be a great thing. It would mean that from now on, Lanka would already have his own team. Is it okay to wait until he grows up? In this small town, I'm afraid he is the only one who has the final say.

Old Liu Tou looked at Hu Zhi's look and smiled slightly: "It's feasible, of course it's feasible. Now most of the children in the town have gone to Xiaolanka's yard to study. There are dozens of them. What do you think? Is there a way to do this?"
