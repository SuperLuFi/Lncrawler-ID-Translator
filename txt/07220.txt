Chang Jun's words caused everyone to think deeply. Everyone had never thought about this problem before, but now that Chang Jun said this, everyone noticed that there was indeed something wrong with the shape of the Blood Killing Sect base. , the shape has become too long and needs to be changed.

Moreover, the situation of the undead clan does have some problems and needs to be changed. As Chang Jun said, the undead clan cannot act alone forever. They must cooperate with other races to fight. If they are not allowed to If the disciples of the Blood Killing Sect act together with the disciples of the Necromancer Clan, they may be a little uncomfortable with the fighting methods of both parties. If they are suddenly allowed to act together, problems may really arise.

Although it is Zhao Hai's order to let the undead clan participate in more battles, the issue raised by Chang Jun is also very important. Cooperation in fighting is something that everyone in the Blood Killing Sect must learn all the time. It is impossible for the undead clan to stay away from these things, and the same is true for the alien clan, so the question raised by Chang Jun is very important.

Wen Wenhai thought for a while and said in a deep voice: "The question raised by Lao Chang is very important. Let's discuss it carefully, then write a report and send it to the boss to see the boss's order. What is it?" Wen Wenhai is absolutely loyal to Zhao Hai, and he will never change the orders given by Zhao Hai, so he feels that this matter must be approved by Zhao Hai, so he wants to write Send a report to Zhao Hai.

No one objected. Everyone believed that this was the right thing to do. Zhao Hai's order could not be changed at will, so everyone nodded in agreement. Naturally, Chang Jun would not object. On the contrary, he thought it was better this way. The same was true for Gu Yuanzheng and the others. After all, they, the Necromancer clan and the Alien clan, were also members of the Blood Killing Sect. If they had been acting alone, they might have fought with each other. The other disciples of the Blood Killing Sect were completely separated, which was not necessarily a good thing for them.

When Wen Wenhai saw that no one objected, he continued: "Okay, let's discuss how to write this report." Wen Wenhai still attached great importance to this matter, so he wanted to write it now After confirming this matter, a report was written as soon as possible and sent to Zhao Hai.

At this time, a person came in from outside the main hall. When everyone saw it, the person who came in was Li Ji. It turned out that Li Ji was not there before. She had gone to Shenji Hall before to report something from the Ancient Expedition. They also attach great importance to the curse, so they have been staying at Shenji Hall and have not come here until now.

As soon as she saw Li Ji coming, the servants immediately saluted Li Ji. Li Ji just waved her hands and then said, "Don't be so polite. What are we discussing now?" Li Ji is the director of the Shenji Hall and the Logistics Hall. representative, and with her status as Mrs. Zhao Hai, it can be said that she is the person with the highest status in the entire hall, so everyone naturally has to salute her.

Li Ji returned the gift, then walked to her seat and sat down. Then he looked at Wen Wenhai and said, "What are we discussing now?" Wen Wenhai immediately repeated what they had said before, and kept talking. In the end, they decided to write a report to Zhao Hai.

After listening to Wen Wenhai's words, Li Ji smiled and said: "It turns out that it's because of this. You have nothing to worry about and there is no need to write a report. Just do what you said. Brother Hai is in retreat now and has no time to deal with these things." , you can just deal with it directly."

As soon as he heard what Li Ji said, Wen Wenhai immediately responded. He had known for a long time that Li Ji and the others had a very high status in Zhao Hai's heart. Zhao Hai had already said that what Li Ji and the others said, It was what he said, so now that Li Ji said this, it was equivalent to Zhao Hai's order, and he would naturally not object.

After this matter was passed, the people didn't say anything else, because this matter was enough for them to be busy. They wanted to change the direction of the attack, and also dispersed the undead clan, the alien clan, and other disciples. When they were mixed together, there were more things to deal with. Just having a meeting was not enough, they had to be done immediately, so the meeting was dismissed directly.

Liji returned to the space and told Laura and the others about this matter. Laura and the others did not object. As for Zhao Hai, he is indeed in retreat now. The most important thing for Zhao Hai now is to understand the way of heaven and let his own The strength becomes stronger. Only in this way can he truly become a master. Even if he goes to Wanshan Realm in the future, he will not have to worry about other sects. This is the most important thing. After all, he is the Blood Killing Sect. The sect leader is the most powerful person in the Blood Killing Sect. He must bear this responsibility on himself.

This time the mixing of the Blood Killing Sect has officially begun. The disciples of the Necromancer clan have been mixed into other teams, and the Necromancer behemoths have also been transferred to other places. The same is true for the Alien clan, so now the Blood Killing Sect has officially begun. The clan members are all very busy. As for the curse of the alien clan, it has not been resolved yet. Because Zhao Hai is in seclusion, there is no way to remove the curse of the alien clan yet.

Fortunately, the curse of the Yaksha clan is not too dangerous. It can be said that this is a way for the Yaksha clan to control their subordinates. When necessary, they can use this curse to make those subordinates fight desperately to buy themselves time. , so this curse does not have a great impact on the alien family.

This adjustment of the Blood Killing Sect is also very necessary, and this adjustment is not the same as the last major adjustment of the Blood Killing Sect. The last major adjustment of the Blood Killing Sect was for the Blood Killing Sect. The disciples of the sect were redistributed into branches and levels, but this time the adjustment was just to adjust their team, which was completely different from the last time.

In other words, when they fight, they will go to their current team, but after the fight, they are still members of their own branch, and nothing has changed. Their usual training is also carried out in the real illusion, and they will be in the real illusion. Here, training with the current team, this is a change.

And what Chang Jun said is very right. The shape of the Blood Killing Sect's current base must also be adjusted. Before, they had been attacking from one side. Now they can finally change the direction, so the Blood Killing Sect is also preparing. While attacking, the alien Yaksha was also released once to conduct reconnaissance outside.

Although these alien yakshas do not have the ability to defend against the curse technique, for now, they are the most suitable for reconnaissance, so it can only be like this. There is no way to change it for a while, but Wen Wenhai and the others although While making adjustments to the entire Blood Killing Sect, they are also preparing for war.

This adjustment of the Blood Killing Sect did not take long, only ten days in total. In these ten days, the undead clan of the Blood Killing Sect and other Blood Killing Sect disciples were completely integrated together. Of course, this refers to the time of fighting, but this is enough.

As for Alien Yaksha, they also scouted about a thousand miles forward in the past ten days. Within this thousand miles, they discovered two cities, which surprised them. They had attacked several times in succession before. They had just encountered two cities. This time they changed the direction. After just traveling a thousand miles, they encountered two cities. How could they not be surprised?

The two cities they saw this time were not very big cities. One of them could only live in about a million people, and the other could live in about three million people. This didn't seem to be very big in the Yaksha world. It is a big city, but the defenses of these two cities have been completely opened, and there are forbidden air formations in these two cities. At the same time, all the fat cows raised by the Yasha clan have also arrived in the city.

Alien Yaksha has already drawn the terrain of these two cities. Although there are forbidden air formations in the sky above these two cities, you can still see them clearly if you are farther away. These two cities are all In the large square city, there is already a forbidden air formation ten miles outside the city, and the people of the Yasha clan in the city are also on full alert.

After receiving the report of the alien Yaksha, Cang Ming immediately sent the Zerg Yaksha to take a look at those two cities. He wanted to know if there were earthly Yakshas in those two cities. They had not been there for some time. I have met the Earth-walking Yaksha before. The fighting power of the Earth-walking Yaksha is very powerful. Now even if the Blood Killing Sect has the Zerg Yaksha, it does not take much advantage when fighting against the Earth-walking Yaksha. Every time it kills If an Earth-walking Yaksha dies, they will also lose a Zerg Yaksha, so they are still very concerned about the Earth-walking Yaksha and the people of the Blood Killing Sect.

But what disappointed them was that when the Zerg Yaksha went to conduct reconnaissance, they found that they could not go underground in those two cities. Because the underground of those two cities were also defended by magic circles, they could not get through at all. , if they really wanted to go over, they would definitely alert the enemy, which would not be good, so the Zerg Yasha did not attack, but retreated directly.

After receiving the news, Wen Wenhai called everyone to the main hall. After everyone arrived, Wen Wenhai glanced at everyone, and then said: "Our current adjustments are over, and we can launch an attack at once Okay, now let me tell you about the enemy we will face this time."

He paused for a moment, then waved his hand, and a projection appeared in front of him. Two cities appeared in the projection. Then he pointed at the two cities and said, "Everyone has seen it, these two cities." The city is the enemy we have to face. The first one is about three hundred miles away from us and has a population of about one million. The city's walls are about a hundred miles long and twenty feet high. Within ten miles outside the city, They all have forbidden air formations, and the city's shield is about five miles away from the city. In other words, if we want to attack the city's shield, we can only do it on the ground, but I think this is nothing. question."

As he spoke, Wen Wenhai pointed at the city, which was immediately zoomed in. Everyone could see clearly what was going on in the city. To be honest, there was really nothing interesting to see in the city. Yes, everyone just focused on the shield and air-forbidden circle outside the city.
