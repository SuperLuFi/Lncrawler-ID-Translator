Zhang Ke walked out of his room with a smile on his face. They won this battle again. Although the victory was a bit miserable, they were still miserable. They used 20,000 people to fight against 10,000 magic circles. The final price paid by those who protected them was to annihilate all the enemies, but their own casualties were about 6,000, which was already very remarkable. .

Zhang Ke and the others suffered greater casualties. When the final battle was over, there were only more than 200 of their thousand people left. However, Zhang Ke did not regret it. He knew very well that if he had not been the last If they tried to test the enemy at first, they would never be able to eliminate them so easily.

Just as Zhang Ke walked out of the room, everyone else in their team also walked out of the room. Everyone had a smile on their face. Even those who had withdrawn from the battle earlier had a smile on their faces. With a smile on their face, they knew that they should be the first to succeed in this battle, so they were so happy.

Zhang Ke looked at them and couldn't help laughing: "It seems that everyone is very happy. I think it's better to be like this. The things we usually eat and drink are all rationed by the sect. Today we all Relax, each of us contributes some points, we buy some spiritual wine from the logistics department, and some good food, we have a good meal and celebrate, what do you think?"

When they heard what he said, everyone was stunned at first, and then they all yelled "Hello", and Gu Yi even laughed loudly and said: "Hahaha, Captain, what you are doing now is really getting worse and worse. He looks like an old man, and can even be said to be very similar to the sect master. I still remember that the sect master used to like to do this very much. Whenever something happy happened, the sect master would immediately say, "I am happy today, let's have a drink together." , Hahahaha, there are really too many people in our sect now, so the sect leader stopped doing this. Unexpectedly, you actually want to do this again today. Okay, let’s do this. Several people I knew before, now there are You work in the logistics department, how about leaving this matter to me?"

When Zhang Ke heard what Gu Yi said, he couldn't help but said with bright eyes: "Really? Hahaha, that's great, okay, then you go and make arrangements. I really didn't expect that the sect leader actually liked to do this before. , Hahahaha." He admired Zhao Hai so much now, so when he heard Gu Yi say this, he also felt very happy.

Gu Yi didn't say anything and went directly to contact someone. But at this moment, Zhang Ke suddenly discovered that someone was contacting him through the magic circle. When he saw the person who contacted him, he couldn't help but be startled. The person who contacted him turned out to be Chu Yun. He immediately connected to the magic circle and said loudly: "Hello, Senior Brother Chu. I really didn't expect that you would contact me so quickly."

"Hahahaha!" Chu Yun's loud laughter came from the magic circle, and then he heard Chu Yun say with a smile: "Junior brother Zhang, don't be so polite, we have left our contact information, of course we need to contact you more often, Junior brother, do you have time now, we are just going to visit."

When Zhang Ke heard what he said, he couldn't help but be stunned, and then said with some confusion: "Is there anyone else who wants to come with you, senior brother? We have nothing to do now. This time the battle is over, and we will do it again I won, so I am very happy, so I plan to go to the logistics department, buy some wine and food, and have a good drink. It would be great if senior brother comes, we are just in time, so we can have a good drink."

When Chu Yun heard what Zhang Ke said, he couldn't help but smile and said: "Okay, that's great. We can't ask for it. In fact, it's me and Wu Ling. Junior brother, send me your coordinates and we'll be there soon." ." Chu Yun seemed very happy, so he immediately asked Zhang Ke for the coordinates.

Zhang Ke naturally did not refuse, and directly gave the coordinates to Chu Yun and the others. Chu Yun said he would be there soon, and then ended the call directly. Just as the call between the two ended, Zhang Ke discovered that someone had contacted him again. He saw that the person who contacted him this time was actually Tan Dongming, whom he had never met before. This made Zhang Ke even more puzzled. Well, you must know that Tan Dongxi had a hostile relationship in the real illusion before. Although Tan Dongxi sent someone to ask for his contact information, he did not expect that Tan Dongxi would be able to do so in such a short period of time. Contacted him, so he felt very puzzled.

However, he still connected to the magic circle, and then said: "But Senior Brother Tan? Zhang Ke is polite." Zhang Ke and Tan Dongming have never met, so he spoke to Tan Dongming very politely, and he also I know that Tan Dongxi is an old man of the Suicide Sect. People like this must not be offended.

"Junior Brother Zhang is so polite. It's Tan. I don't know what Junior Brother Zhang is up to. Tan wants to visit Junior Brother Zhang. I don't know if it's convenient." A nice, very gentle voice came over. This voice was very nice. It gives people a very comfortable feeling as soon as they hear it, and just listening to the sound makes people feel good about it.

But Zhang Ke didn't know what to say for a moment, because Chu Yun and the others were coming. Wouldn't it be bad if Tan Dongming came here in Jilu? Thinking of this, Zhang Ke couldn't help but said: "Senior Brother Tan wants to come, and I will naturally welcome him. However, several senior brothers have said that they want to come to me before, so I'm afraid it's inconvenient today, so please forgive me." Zhang Ke decided to tell the truth, because there was really no need to lie about such a thing.

When Tan Dongming heard what Zhang Ke said, he couldn't help but ponder for a moment, which made Zhang Ke feel a little uneasy. He really didn't want to offend people like Tan Dongming, because Zhang Ke knew very well that a bloody person like Tan Dongming The old people of the Blood Killing Sect all have their own network of relationships. Maybe they don’t know anyone with a high status, but the energy of these people is definitely not small, and if they can’t do it alone, they may also know some people from the Blood Killing Sect. If the senior management really offended them, there would be no benefit, so he could only tell the truth.

Soon Tan Dongming's voice came again: "I don't know who is going to the junior brother's place today? But are they the people who are acting with the senior brother this time? Is it Chu Yun and the others?" Tan Dongming's voice is still there He was so gentle, but he immediately revealed the identity of the people who were going to Zhang Ke's place.

Zhang Ke was stunned for a moment, then smiled and said: "Senior brother is really good at predicting things. Yes, it is senior brother Chu and the others who are coming." Zhang Ke heard it from Tan Dongming's words. Tan Dongming seemed to know Chu Yun, but He didn't know what the relationship was, but he didn't intend to hide it from Tan Dongxi, so he said it directly.

Tan Dongming said with a smile: "It turns out it's really Chu Yun and the others. That's just right. Chu Yun and I haven't seen each other for a long time. This time we will go to Junior Brother Zhang's place to get together. Junior Brother, can you welcome me? ?" Tan Dongming was not polite and directly said that he wanted to come and get together, which surprised Zhang Ke.

However, Zhang Ke immediately said: "Welcome, little brother, you are welcome. I have sent people to the logistics department to buy some food and wine, waiting for the arrival of the senior brothers." Zhang Ke heard that Tan Dongming and Chu Yun were indeed We knew each other, and they seemed to have a good relationship, so he agreed immediately.

Tan Dongming smiled and said: "Okay, thank you so much, junior brother." After saying that, he ended the communication directly, but Zhang Ke stood there in a daze. He did not expect that there were two people who seemed to be pretty good. The old disciple of the Blood Killing Sect actually came to visit him like this, which clearly showed that he accepted him, which made him really feel like he didn't know what to say.

Zhang Ke knew very well that although the old disciples of the Blood Killing Sect were very polite to the newcomers and seemed to have a good relationship with them, those old disciples were actually very exclusive. They had their own It is rare for them to join a circle, and now whether it is Tan Dongming or Zhang Ke, they are all old disciples of the Blood Killing Sect, and they seem to have a high status. Such people How could he not be surprised that he was coming to visit him now, but he also understood that this meant that Tan Dongming and Chu Yun had officially recognized and accepted him, which made him very happy. .

At this time, Gu Yi also came to Zhang Ke and said to Zhang Ke: "Captain, we have made arrangements. The logistics department will send things over soon, enough for us to have a good meal. Yes." When Gu Yi said this, he glanced at Zhang Ke and found that Zhang Ke's expression was a little strange. He couldn't help but asked curiously: "Captain, what's wrong?"

Zhang Ke looked at Gu Daoyao: "Old Gu, don't you think it's a little weird? Senior Brother Chu Yun and Senior Brother Tan Dongming actually want to come to our place to visit me. I have already agreed. I am just a little curious, why do they suddenly want to Are you coming to visit me?" Zhang Ke was very confused. Chu Yun and Tan Dongming suddenly wanted to visit him, which made him very confused. If it was because of their strong strength, it seemed that there was no need, right? Although their strength is strong, it has nothing to do with Tan Dongming and Chu Yun. Why are they doing this?

Gu Yiyi was stunned when he heard what Zhang Ke said. He thought for a moment, then couldn't help but smile slightly and said: "I think there are only two reasons. One is because we are strong. We are such an awesome team, no matter who it is. , they all want to be on good terms with us, which will only benefit them and not harm them. When we act together in the future, we will be able to take care of each other. If the relationship is better, it will be more convenient to act together. Secondly, Because our performance is definitely not comparable to that of other teams. The biggest difference is that we have the aura of true Blood Killing Sect disciples. They feel that we are already true Blood Killing Sect disciples, so they will accept us. "

Zhang Ke nodded and said: "It is very possible that Senior Brother Chu Yun and Senior Brother Tan Dongming contacted me one after another. I have never thought of such a situation before. By the way, Gu Yi, you are also an old man of the sect. Then do you know these two senior brothers? What kind of people are they? How strong are they? From what Senior Brother Tan said, it seems that they know each other? I wonder if you know them?"
