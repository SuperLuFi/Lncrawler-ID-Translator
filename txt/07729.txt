c7729 set up an ambush

When Zhang Ke and the others leave this time, they are no longer afraid that the enemy will catch up. The enemy has already been fooled once, and they are still afraid of being ambushed once, so they will not catch up easily again. Zhang Ke and the others will have some rest. At the same time, they also need to contact the people from the other two teams to see how the situation is there.

As Zhang Ke flew forward, he contacted the people from the other two teams. The people from the other two teams immediately connected to his magic circle. Another person said: "We are going pretty smoothly here, although we have suffered losses. He killed nearly half of them, but also knocked down two-thirds of the enemy, and the remaining 300 or so people just ran away."

Another person also said: "Our situation here is not bad, because we are in the woods, the enemy can't find us for a while, we are resting, don't worry about us, Zhang Ke, how is the situation there with you? "The person who said this was obviously the team that wanted to use the woods to get rid of the enemies.

Zhang Ke immediately said: "Our advance here was relatively smooth. We lost nearly 200 people, but we killed more than 800 or nearly 900 of the opponent's people. They didn't dare to pursue them for a while, Ji Xing, Tell us your position and our two teams will join together immediately."

Ji Xing was the one who found out that the enemy was a small team chasing him and fought directly with the enemy. As soon as he heard what Zhang Ke said, he immediately said: "Okay, I will send you my location, and you will come over right away." Right." There are only more than 500 people in his team now. After joining Zhang Ke, their number will become more than 1,000, so they will be a considerable force. When the time comes, they will go to fight with another team. The people of the small teams have gathered together, and with all the people they have left now, they are fully capable of fighting the people of those two teams. As long as the people of those two teams are killed, then there will only be one enemy left. If there are more than a thousand, then they can fight each other.

After Zhang Ke received the location of the lucky star, he immediately led the people and rushed over. This time, their speed was very fast. Although they were still in the woods, their speed was increased. By an hour, they had arrived at the gathering place mentioned by Ji Xing.

When they arrived at the meeting place, they found that Ji Xing and the others were indeed waiting for them there. The two teams met together. Although they were not very familiar with each other, they still gave each other a smile. In any case, they were People in the same camp, and they all survived a crisis.

Zhang Ke came to Ji Xing's side and said in a deep voice: "Now that our two teams have gathered together, there are already more than a thousand people. Adding the thousand people from Buck's place, we have more than two thousand people." , if we can reach Buck and his friends in the shortest time, then we may have time to eat the two thousand enemies at Buck's place, what do you think?"

Ji Xing thought for a while, nodded and said: "It's feasible, can we go there now? We can ask Buck to send us their coordinates, and we can go directly to the teleportation array, but in this way, the enemies there will soon If they find us, they will definitely attack us when the time comes, so we must be careful.”

Zhang Ke said solemnly: "When we find it, we find it. Isn't this exactly what we need? The enemy should not have thought that we would gather together in such a short period of time. If they come after us, we will just take care of them." , if all of them are gathered together, it won’t be a big deal. We are only about a thousand fewer than them now, which is enough to deal with them.”

As soon as Ji Xing heard what Zhang Ke said, he said in a deep voice: "Okay, let's do it like this." After saying that, he took out the communication circle, contacted Ba Gu directly, and told Buck their plan. Buck immediately told Ji Xing and the others the coordinates of their place, and Ji Xing and the others went directly to Buck's place.

After they arrived at Buck's place, Buck took a look at the people they brought, nodded with satisfaction and said: "Okay, you two did a good job. I used the disguise magic circle before to make the magic circle here fluctuate. , replaced by another kind of magic circle fluctuation, they should not be able to feel it, this is the fluctuation of the teleportation circle, but they should have discovered us, so our plan is completely feasible."

Ji Xing and Zhang Ke both nodded, and Ji Xing said, "Do you have any plans?" Ji Xing and Zhang Ke had just arrived here, and were not very familiar with the surroundings, so Ji Xing asked Buck directly what plans he had. , he believed that Buck should already have a plan.

Buck said solemnly: "I just used the disguised magic circle to make the energy fluctuations here smaller and weaker, so that others would think that we were setting up the magic circle here to ambush them, but at the same time they also They will know our location, so they will rush over immediately. My plan is this, we will pretend to ambush them here, and they will conduct reconnaissance on our place. After discovering our actions, they may be outside, Form a larger encirclement, surround us inside, and what you have to do is, form a larger encirclement outside, surround them inside. When the time comes, we will give them a center to bloom, and they will be finished. .”

This plan is also very simple. Ji Xing and Zhang Ke immediately understood what he meant. They both nodded and said: "Okay, that's it. You prepare here, and we will go to the periphery immediately." After two words, The man clasped his fists at Jixing and Zhang Ke, and then the two men moved, led the two groups of them, and disappeared directly.

Buck glanced around, turned to his men and said, "Everyone, get ready and go." Everyone obviously knew his plan, so they just dispersed and made disguises. Pretending to be carrying out an ambush, in order to appear more realistic, they moved the location of the ambush a little further ahead of where their teleportation array caused energy fluctuations, so that the other party would not suspect them.

Sure enough, less than half an hour after they were ready, they had already received a notification from Ji Xing that the enemy had arrived, and the enemy was surrounding Buck and the others. It didn't take long for Buck and the others to feel the pressure on their backs. Someone touched it. They pretended to have just discovered it, and immediately turned around to face the enemy. At the same time, they kept shrinking. Soon they were compressed by the enemy to a very small area.

At this time, an enemy said with a smile: "Man, you actually want to use this method to lure us here and ambush us. I really don't know what to say. I think you should surrender. This way we will save us trouble. How about it?" Obviously, he thought he was sure to win, so he made fun of Buck and the others.

Buck looked at the faces of those people and sneered: "It's not until the last moment, we don't know who will win and who will lose." After saying that, he waved his hand, and a ball of white light rose into the sky, and at this moment, at Behind those people, there were bursts of shouts of killing. When those people heard this sound, they were all stunned. Then Buck and the others immediately accelerated their attack speed. In an instant, the situation was reversed. Those who surrounded Buck and the others were, in turn, surrounded. With Buck and the others attacking from the inside, they were completely at a disadvantage for a moment.

Those people were shocked and angry, but they were still fighting with all their strength, and at the same time they were a whole team. When they saw this situation, Buck and the others couldn't help but their hearts sank. They knew that this time they encountered a tough nut, although It is said that the disciples of the Blood Killing Sect all receive the same training. However, due to the recent addition of people from the Heavenly Realm and the Sea Clan, although the number of Blood Killing Sect disciples has increased, it has also made them fight for a long time. Ability has become much worse.

That day, the people of the human world and those of the Sea Clan had not yet learned the will to fight to the death like the disciples of the Blood Killing Sect, so he would easily run away when encountering a tough battle, but in the Blood Killing Sect, he still There are many teams, and there are far fewer Sea Clan disciples and people from the Celestial Realm in their teams. Most of them are composed of old disciples of the Blood Killing Sect. These disciples are the kind of extremely brave warriors. They are in front of them. When facing the enemy, they will fight to the death, and the enemy often does not have the resilience like them, so it is very likely that the enemy will lose in the end.

The enemies Buck and the others encountered this time were obviously such a group of people. Although they were all disciples of the Blood Killing Sect, those disciples were extremely brave. Although they were at a disadvantage, they kept shouting for a fierce fight, even if they retreated. , also retreating while fighting, without even a little panic, and it can be seen that they are not really retreating, they are just retreating, and when the enemy can't stand it anymore, they will immediately counterattack.

Facing such an enemy, Buck and the others' faces were extremely solemn. They knew very well that facing such an enemy, they could never take it lightly. If they failed to do so, they would be wiped out here. They You must not retreat. Don't look at the fact that they have the upper hand now, but once they retreat, those people will come up immediately and kill them directly. This is the most terrifying thing.

Be it Buck, Ji Xing, or Zhang Ke, none of them are disciples of the Original Blood Killing Sect. Buck is from the world of heaven and humans, and Ji Xing and Zhang Ke are both from the Hai Clan. A large number of their subordinates , they were all from the Heavenly Realm and the Sea Clan, and only some were from the Blood Killing Sect, just like Gu Yi and the others, so in this situation, they couldn't help but feel a little scared and didn't know what to do.

And Gu Yi, who had been fighting the enemy, also discovered this. Buck and the others had not issued an order for a long time, or even said a word. This was terrible for low-level commanders on the battlefield. This is definitely not a good thing. The purpose of low-level commanders on the battlefield is to boost morale. If they cannot even do this, the consequences will be very serious.

As soon as he thought of this, Gu Yi immediately connected to Zhang Ke's communication circle. As soon as Zhang Ke connected, he immediately said loudly: "Captain, don't think so much now, just fight. Fight with all your strength. You can only put the front Only when the enemy is eliminated or defeated can we have a way out, and we must do it as soon as possible, otherwise, if the enemy's reinforcements arrive, it will be over."
