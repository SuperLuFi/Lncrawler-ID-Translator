When Xiao Yao heard what Old Liu Tou said, his expression couldn't help but change. He immediately said: "Uncle Liu? Is this true? Where have all the people from the Gujian Gang gone? Have they left the town?" Xiao Yao Zhen said What he didn't expect was that Old Liu Tou didn't see anyone from the Ancient Sword Sect. How could he not be surprised?

Old Liu shook his head and said: "I don't know. Anyway, I haven't seen anyone from the Gujian Gang, but it shouldn't be possible. They haven't done anything unusual in the past few days." Before he finished speaking, I saw that Xiao Yao had already run to his shop and ran straight in the direction of the Gujian Gang.

When Old Liu Tou saw Xiao Yao's appearance, his eyes lit up. He found that Xiao Yao seemed to be too concerned about the affairs of the Gujian Gang. Is there something wrong with him? But now it was just his guess, and he didn't say anything. He really wanted to see what Zhao Hai was going to do this time. Did he really want to leave Linyuan Town forever? Even if he really wants to leave Linyuan Town, it doesn't matter. He believes that they will be able to find Zhao Hai and the others. As long as they appear in other towns, he will be able to find them.

When Old Liu Tou was thinking about these things, he saw Xiao Yao running back with a very ugly expression on his face. He said to Old Liu Tou: "Uncle Liu, everyone from the Gujian Gang has left. There is nothing left, all their belongings have been taken away, there is nothing left.”

Lao Liutou immediately pretended to be surprised and said: "Really? Impossible. There was nothing unusual about them before? How could they all leave?" As he said this, he walked out. , and then quickly went to the yard of Lanka's house. The reason why he did this was to let people know that he was not aware of the actions of the Ancient Sword Gang.

Xiao Yao also followed Old Liu Tou to the yard of Lanka's house. Seeing that the yard and backyard were cleaned up, Old Liu Tou's face was also very ugly. He said in a deep voice: "It seems that they are real." They left, I really didn’t expect them to leave just like that, but why? Why did they leave? "

Xiao Yao's face was also very ugly. He said in a deep voice: "When they leave, there will be no one in Linyuan Town. So what will we do in the future? Open a shop in other towns? But other towns We had our own shop early in the morning, but we used to compete with others for business, so I’m afraid we won’t have a good life, right?”

Old Liu Tou's face was also very ugly. He said in a deep voice: "Let's discuss it with everyone first. I always feel strange that the Gujian Gang stayed well in the town. Why did they leave suddenly? This What's going on? There may be something wrong there, and now that the Gujian Gang is gone, it doesn't make any sense for us to stay here. We must discuss it with everyone." Xiao Yao also nodded. Then he followed Lao Liutou and walked out.

Soon, the remaining people in the shops in the town realized that all the people from the Gujian Gang were gone, and no one was left. This surprised everyone, even Ke Laixuan. He and Yunlai Inn were both surprised. They did not expect that the people from the Gujian Gang would leave directly. Although the shopkeepers of their two stores knew that someone was going to deal with the Gujian Gang, they did not expect that the Gujian Gang would actually How could they not be surprised that he just left like this.

The people in the four major stores also quickly received the news. For the shopkeepers of the four major stores, hearing the news was like a bolt from the blue. For the people in other stores, they just didn't have it. Business, but for them, the meaning is completely different. If the people from the Gujian Gang really leave and will not come back, then their store will have no choice but to close. By that time, they will , I am afraid that they will be given up directly by the people in the sect. By then, their lives will not be much easier than those of casual cultivators.

So the shopkeepers of the four major shops came to the yard of Lanka's house in the shortest time. At the same time, they also went to other houses in the city to have a look. In the end, they found that there was really no one in the city, and everyone The family's house has also been tidied up, and all the things that can be taken away have been taken away. It seems that they have really left.

This discovery made the shopkeepers of the four major stores turn pale. They knew very well that the people standing behind them were about to come to the town. If they knew that all the people in the town were gone, then What would they think? You must know that those people are counting on these shops to earn spiritual stones. Now that there is no one in the town, how can they earn spiritual stones? By that time, they will probably vent their anger on them, right?

But then the shopkeepers of the four major stores immediately thought that the people from the Gujian Gang must have left last night, which meant that they did not leave for a long time, and their team was all filled with old people. Weak and there were many children, then they must not be able to go far. When they thought of this, they immediately returned to their store and sent out all the clerks in the store. They even went out themselves to find Gu. The people from the Jian Gang must find people from the Ancient Sword Gang, otherwise they will really be doomed.

However, Zhao Hai and the others did not know what was happening in the town. They were still walking forward. As they walked forward, Zhao Hai said to the crowd: "Let's speed up the pace at home. We only need to walk forward for two seconds." In about ten miles, we will reach the first resting place. By then, we can have a good rest, let's go."

Everyone responded, and then quickened their pace. Some children were already carried on other people's backs. Although they were all old or had suffered hidden injuries, they were still practicing in any way. There is still no problem at all, so everyone is not moving very slowly.

Before noon, they had arrived at a cave. The cave didn't look very big. There were so many of them that they would definitely not be able to enter. However, Zhao Hai walked directly to the cave and then walked into the cave. I cast a magic spell, but I didn't expect that the innermost wall of the cave would shrink inward, revealing a deep cave entrance. From that cave, there was even wind blowing out.

When everyone entered the cave, they discovered that this cave actually had a different cave. There was another cave inside the cave, but this cave was inside the mountain. It was very large. You could see a lot of stalagmites inside, and there were also many stalagmites on the ground. It was very dry. After Zhao Hai sealed the entrance of the cave, a faint blue light appeared on the stalagmites. It was very beautiful. Everyone looked at the cave and didn't know what to say for a moment.

Zhao Hai glanced at everyone at this time and said in a deep voice: "Okay, everyone, let's take a rest here today. This is not our base. Our base has to go a little further, but the children in our team It’s too much, so let’s rest here today, let’s have something to eat, and then just rest.”

Everyone was indeed tired, so they all responded, and then those who were carrying children put the children down, ate something, and then began to sleep. Zhao Hai sat on the ground and meditated. He knew that they This action will definitely cause a big stir in the small town, but he doesn't care. Anyway, he just wants to teach the four major stores a lesson, and it's nothing special.

While Zhao Hai and the others were resting in the cave, people from the four major shops were already looking for them outside. A group of people also came in the direction Zhao Hai was walking. They flew, but unfortunately Unfortunately, they did not see Zhao Hai and the others. They even went to the woods to take a closer look, but found nothing. In the end, they could only return without success.

Zhao Hai knew when those people came to find them, but he had confidence in himself. He believed that those people could not find anything. As expected, those people found nothing and could only leave in the end, but they They settled down in the cave with peace of mind, and it was not until the next morning that they left the cave, and then walked forward for about fifty miles. When it got dark, they came to a There is nothing special about the hill, there is nothing special about this hill. It is just a small dirt hill covered with trees. Apart from these, there is nothing special about it.

But just when they arrived at the foot of the hill, they saw a person suddenly jumping down from a tree. Everyone was startled. After a closer look, they found that the person who came was actually Xiao Jiu. Xiao Jiu looked excited. He looked at everyone, then walked quickly to Zhao Hai, gave a big salute to Zhao Hai and said: "Brother Ying, we were thinking about going out to meet us tonight, but we didn't expect that you guys would arrive so quickly. We I just arrived, come with me."

Zhao Hai also nodded, and then said with a smile: "We had a rest yesterday, let's go, let's talk when we go in." Xiao Jiu responded and led Zhao Hai and the others forward, and soon they arrived behind the hill. There was a forest in the woods, and then he led everyone to a small pool in the middle of the woods. Then Xiaojiu directly cast a few spells into the pool. The water in the pool actually split to both sides, and then He cast another spell, and the soil under the pool became very hard. Zhao Hai directly directed everyone to go under the pool. Although everyone was a little puzzled, they didn't say anything and went straight to the pool. Walking down below, they soon discovered that the mountain pool was like a passage, leading directly into the hill. When they came out from the other side of the mountain pool, they found themselves in a large cave, and People are busy in the cave now, and these busy people are Hu Zhi and the others.

When Hu Zhi and the others saw Zhao Hai and the others coming in, everyone was stunned. Then Hu Zhi immediately walked over to Zhao Hai, hugged Zhao Hai, and patted Zhao Hai hard. Then he let go of his back and said: "Brother, you are here, but we are worried to death. Okay, it will be good when we arrive, it will be good when we arrive. Let's live here for a while and deal with those guys well." For a moment, I really want to see what those guys can do to us."
