Speaking of which, almost all the people in the Blood Killing Sect are loyal. Firstly, the treatment of the Blood Killing Sect is the best. As long as you become a disciple of the Blood Killing Sect, you will get relatively fair and good treatment. , is unmatched by any other force. The most important thing is that these benefits are not only good, but also the most suitable for you. This is the most important thing.

The second reason is that the Blood Killing Sect has always had a kind of brainwashing education for the Blood Killing Sect disciples, which is to let them know about Zhao Hai’s merits and to let them know that they are where they are today, all because of Zhao Hai. , and in fact, they did not panic. The Blood Killing Sect is what it is today, really all because of Zhao Hai.

The third reason is because of Zhao Hai's strength. Zhao Hai's strength has always been the strongest in the Blood Killing Sect. He is not just a little bit stronger than the average person in the Blood Killing Sect, but a lot. Among the Blood Killing Sect disciples, In their hearts, Zhao Hai is undoubtedly one of the gods, so they worship Zhao Hai so much that they naturally won't have any problems.

It is precisely because of this that in the Blood Killing Sect, how much power a person has actually depends on Zhao Hai. How much power Zhao Hai gives you is how much power you have. If he doesn't give it to you, then you will Without power, this is reality. And this time, the reason why others wanted to look high on Hu Changfeng was not because Hu Changfeng controlled so many exercises to bless the fusion method team, but because they saw Zhao Hai's trust in him through this incident. This is what they saw. The place where Zhonghu Changfeng is.

Wen Wenhai had no opinion on this matter. He glanced at everyone and said, "Okay, all the things to be discussed today have been discussed. I won't say more about other things. Mr. Zhen , I still want to trouble you. You need to find out what the combat effectiveness of the new fusion Dharma team is and what position they are more suitable for. At the same time, you must also pay attention to what we said before. The enemy may also have Kung Fu blessings and one-armed weapons. Regarding the matter of Giant Palm Asura, we must pay close attention to these matters and include them all in the battle plan to avoid any problems."

Mr. Zhen nodded and responded. Wen Wenhai then turned to everyone and said: "Okay, that's it. Let's go back first. This time our rest time is still three days. After three days, we will The Asura clan will attack." After saying that, he bowed to everyone.

Everyone also stood up, bowed to Wen Wenhai, and then turned around and left. They discussed a lot of things in today's meeting, and everyone paid great attention to it. After everyone goes back, they must also do well. Do some research and make some adjustments appropriately.

However, Wen Wenhai stopped Hu Changfeng, and then said to Hu Changfeng: "Old Hu, when those magic machine and Dharma teams arrive, please let me know and I'm going to take a look. To be honest, I really don't know. How is the combat effectiveness of the Shenji Faxiang team? Let's go and see." Wen Wenhai was really curious. He had also practiced Shenji's set of exercises. This set of exercises was really miraculous. He It can be completely integrated with the exercises you have learned, and can be used as an auxiliary exercise for you, but at the same time, it can also form its own set of exercises. It is precisely because of this that it is like this curious.

Hu Changfeng responded, then saluted Wen Wenhai, then turned and left. Wen Wenhai looked at his back and couldn't help but smile, and then turned around and returned to his room. He was not worried that Hu Changfeng would threaten his position, especially after Zhao Hai had just summoned him and told him about the huge After the secret, he became less worried. He knew very well that he was still Zhao Hai's confidant, and the most favored confidant. Hu Changfeng was still far behind.

Just two hours after the meeting ended, Hu Changfeng told Wen Wenhai that those people were coming. As soon as he heard the news, Wen Wenhai was also very interested. He immediately came to the bloody battle fort where Hu Changfeng was. This bloody battle In the fort, almost all of them were members of the Fusion Dharma Team. Putting them in a battle fort would make it easier for Hu Changfeng to manage them.

As soon as Hu Changfeng saw Wen Wenhai arriving, he immediately led Wen Wenhai to the battle fort. The environment in the bloody battle fort was very good. People all lived in the Supertree. In addition, in this battle fort , there are many plants, the aura is very sufficient, and they can fly, so the environment in this battle fortress is really nothing to say.

By the time Hu Changfeng led Wen Wenhai to the sky above the battle fort, there were already twenty fusion law teams standing there waiting for them. When he saw these twenty teams, Wen Wenhai After being stunned for a moment, he then turned to look at Hu Changfeng and said, "Are these all teams that have learned the magic of magic?"

Hu Changfeng nodded, and then said with a smile: "Yes, all of them. Shenji's set of exercises is quite special. You also know that some of the people in these teams originally focused on learning other exercises. Later, they learned the divine machine, but their attainments in the divine machine turned out to be better than the original technique, so they now focus on the divine machine. This time, they were gathered together for training. Unexpectedly, it really worked. It’s done.”

Wen Wenhai looked at these disciples of the Blood Killing Sect. These disciples of the Blood Killing Sect were very energetic. The most important thing was that they still had a trace of murderous intent in their bodies. After discovering this, Wen Wenhai couldn't help but feel... Somewhat puzzled, he turned to Hu Changfeng and said, "What? They also integrated murderous intent into the divine machine and the law?"

Hu Changfeng said solemnly: "The Divine Machine is ever-changing. When needed, it is a murderous weapon on the battlefield. So of course it is necessary to integrate the murderous intention into the Divine Machine's law. This is very important." Hu Changfeng was very He knew clearly that if he didn't integrate his murderous aura into the Dharma, he wouldn't be able to withstand the enemy's momentum. If he couldn't even withstand the enemy's momentum, let alone attack the enemy.

Wen Wenhai nodded, and then said: "Okay, then they are still under your command. Next time they fight against the Asura clan, I hope they can teach the Asura clan a lesson." Hu Changfeng nodded. , he didn't say anything more, but there was a flash of murderous intent in his eyes.

Three days passed in the blink of an eye. The battle plan of the formation leader had long been sent to the elders. Naturally, they knew what they should do, and they had already made preparations. Waiting for the time to attack, on the morning of the fourth day, Gu Yuanzheng still got up early, gathered the troops, arranged their formation, and prepared for the attack.

Following Wen Wenhai's order, the Blood Killing Sect's army marched directly out of the Zhanzhi Fortress and entered the grassland. Now among the troops on the front line, there was not only a member of the Nine Numbers Turtle clan, but also When an elder sits in charge, they are afraid that the enemy will send experts to attack them. With these elders in charge, even if the enemy wants to attack them, they can respond in the shortest time.

The army kept advancing, but not a single person from the Asura clan was encountered. This really surprised the people of the Blood Killing Sect. Could it be that the people of the Asura clan were already frightened by them and did not dare to fight? Are you fighting them? Although they thought so, the army still did not stop and continued to advance.

Just when the army advanced about two hundred miles, the people of the Jiu Shugui clan in the frontline army shouted stop. As soon as they shouted stop, everyone stopped, but those people of the Jiu Shugui clan did not. Instead of immediately thinking of a way to break the formation, they began to communicate. They chatted with each other for a while, as if they were discussing something. Finally, they made up their minds. All the people from the Nine Number Turtle clan on the front line showed up. After coming out of their true bodies, following the order of a Nine-numbered Turtle Elder, all of them emitted white light. These white lights actually merged together in front of the Blood Killing Sect army and turned into a beam of white light. Then this The white light shot straight forward.

After this white light shot out for about ten miles, a loud bang was heard. This white light seemed to hit a wall and was blocked by something. The people of the Blood Killing Sect took a closer look, but they were surprised. I found that something like water ripples was appearing where the white light was blocked. The space there seemed to be broken, but it never broke.

The white light shot out for a while, and the place where the ripples appeared suddenly burst with a loud bang. A large number of Asura cavalry appeared there, and those Asura cavalry did not show any panic. , they just stood there quietly, and the white light could only break the formation, but it did no harm to the Asura clan's cavalry.

Seeing this situation, the people of the Nine Numbers Turtle Clan put away their white light and retreated. The disciples of the Blood Killing Sect also activated the War Planting Seeds, and rows of tree walls appeared in the Blood Killing Sect. In front of Zong's army. But strangely, the Asura clan's cavalry did not mount their horses. They just stood there and quietly watched the movements of the Blood Killing Sect disciples, as if they had no intention of attacking at all. What they did was... The disciple who wanted to kill the sect with blood was very surprised.

At this time, I heard a voice suddenly coming from the Asura formation: "People of the Blood Killing Sect, listen, you and I have fought several times, and we have won and lost. The Shura clan, recognize that you members of the Blood Killing Sect are heroes, and be our opponents as the Asura clan. Today we will give you a fair chance to fight. Today we will fight, do you dare?" This voice was very loud. , and it came from the large formation of the Asura clan, so it was impossible to see who was speaking, but his words were heard by both the enemy and ourselves.

Gu Yuanzheng naturally heard what the other party said. When he heard what the other party said, he couldn't help but be stunned. Then his face couldn't help but become strange. He murmured: "Fighting General? Interesting. Could it be that they want to use this method, and then Let the masters of the Asura clan fight? How about letting our Blood Killing Sect's fusion law team fight? It's really a good idea."

Although he said this, Gu Yuanzheng still told Wen Wenhai the news directly. After all, the enemy has decided to fight generals. This is not a trivial matter. He must listen to Wen Wenhai's decision. If Ah If the Shura clan really sent those masters to fight as he thought, they might suffer a loss.
