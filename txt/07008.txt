c7008 war

As the two sides continued to shoot at each other, the distance between the two sides became closer and closer. Finally, the two sides finally reached a close combat distance. The first attack was still the Mo Dao soldiers of the Blood Killing Sect, and the Mo Dao soldiers of the Blood Killing Sect. It is relatively long, and when swung, the killing distance is also relatively far, so they launched the attack first, swung the Mo Dao in their hands, and slashed forward.

I heard a banging sound, and the enemy also raised the big shield in their hands to block it, and Mo Dao chopped the enemy's big shield into pieces in one go. There were many of their big shields, and they were all made of hardwood. It is made very thick, and is covered with a layer of cowhide on the outside, so the defense is still very strong, but it still cannot stop the attack of Mo Dao soldiers. The big shields in their hands were cut off by Mo Dao soldiers in one blow. Broken.

However, because their large shields were too thick and heavy, although Mo Dao shattered the large shield they formed, it still gave those people time to react. They raised their weapons and aimed at Mo Dao. When they came over, they heard a blocking sound. The weapons in their hands actually held Mo Dao. Just when those people were about to rush forward and get close to Mo Dao's soldiers, weapons stretched out from the side of Mo Dao. The spears came, and these spears pierced directly into their backs, and those people were stabbed to death directly.

But the Mo Dao soldiers didn't even look at the dead ones. They raised the Mo Dao once, shouted loudly, and waved the Mo Dao again. This time their Mo Dao fell faster and heavier, and At this moment, and this time the opponent failed to block it, the big shield was shattered, the weapons in their hands were also cut off, the armor on their bodies was cut open by Mo Dao, and the people were cut open.

The cooperation of the Mo Dao soldiers and the spear soldiers formed a very solid line of defense. The enemy was attacking this defense, but they have never been able to break through this line of defense. At this time, the disciples of the Blood Killing Sect discovered that some of the enemy people came to the horses again. They began to feed and water the horses, and then put armor on the horses. After doing this, they got on the horses directly. , and then each of them took out their own weapons. Their weapons were still heavy weapons, mainly for combat. Then they adjusted their direction and prepared to charge against the Blood Killing Sect's defense line.

As soon as they saw this situation, Baiyan and the other frontline commanders immediately gave orders and the pikemen began to gather. They were preparing to use pikemen to block the charge of the opponent's cavalry. At the same time, the cavalry of the Blood Killing Sect was also ready. They were ready to attack at any time, and the Blood Slaughter Sect's bed slaves and catapults were also ready.

After the opponent's cavalry lined up, they began to slowly move towards the Blood Killer Sect's defense line. They did not charge directly. They wore several layers of armor, held heavy weapons in their hands, and their tanks also had their armor broken. This in itself makes the weight of the war horse very huge. If they charge right up, the physical strength of the war horse will be unbearable. They have to charge more than a hundred meters away from the Blood Killing Sect's defense line. They are heavily armored. Once the cavalry charge, it is very difficult to stop them.

The spearmen of the Blood Killing Sect also found their direction and gathered in front of the direction where the opponent's heavy armor soldiers were going to charge, waiting for the opponent to charge. But before they could fight, the Blood Killer Sect's bed slaves showed off their power first. Huge arrows, carrying huge kinetic energy, were shot at the heavy armored cavalry. Although the defense of those heavy armored cavalry was very He was strong, but when faced with those heavy arrows, both men and horses were nailed to the ground.

At the same time, the fire oil fruits were also thrown into the enemy's team one by one. Several enemies were directly smashed down. Then the fire oil fruits exploded and burned many people to death. However, these enemies were not shield soldiers. Their armor doesn't catch fire. Even if the armor on their body catches fire, they can just throw it away without being seriously injured.

However, these big arrows still caused great damage to some cavalry, but those cavalry did not stop. Soon they arrived at a place only about a hundred meters away from the former Blood Killer Sect's defense line, and then they began to charge directly, and they continued The enemies who were fighting with the Blood Killing Sect dodged to the side, and some who couldn't get out of the way were directly knocked away by their cavalry.

The Mo Dao soldiers of the Blood Killing Sect also moved to the side at this time, and then began to retreat. Then, rows of spearmen appeared. These spearmen all stood there with their spears raised, and then one of them shouted: "Reject the horses." Following his voice, the spearmen all stretched their spears forward diagonally. In an instant, the spearmen's team turned into a huge hedgehog, waiting for the enemy to hit him, and they The spear in his hand is made entirely of steel, not a wooden spear, and its impact resistance is even stronger.

Sure enough, the enemy's cavalry directly hit those spears, and the men and horses were penetrated directly. However, the cavalry behind them were still charging continuously against the Blood Killing Sect's spearmen defense. Some cavalry even When they were about to hit the spears of the Blood Killers, they jumped up from their horses, howling, and rushed towards the formation of the Blood Killers' spearmen.

But in the end, he could only hang on the spears of the Blood Killing Sect's spearmen. The Blood Killing Sect's spearmen were not generally strong. Their power was very huge. Even if they didn't use the power in their armor, they would Their own strength is also very strong. You must know that all of them have gone through physical training. The Blood Killing Sect has always attached great importance to physical training, so their strength cannot be underestimated.

Just when the enemy's cavalry was still attacking the Blood Killing Sect's formation, long arrows suddenly flew out from their sides. These long arrows attacked many cavalry. The power of these arrows was No small matter, as long as those cavalry were hit by these long arrows, they would be seriously injured even if they were not dead.

Those people turned around and saw that the cavalry of the Blood Killing Sect were attacking them. The cavalry of the Blood Killing Sect were very fast, and the bows in their hands were also strong bows with very powerful attack power. It is almost impossible for the enemy to find favor in their hands.

Being stunned by this sudden blow, those people immediately separated themselves and prepared to attack the cavalry of the Blood Killing Sect. However, the cavalry of the Blood Killing Sect would not fight them. Instead, they turned around and ran away. , while running and shooting arrows behind. From time to time, some of the enemy's cavalry were shot off their horses and fell directly to the ground, and were then trampled to pieces by the horses of their companions behind them.

The attack of the cavalry of the Blood Killer Sect directly gave the enemy the most lethal blow, which instantly distracted all the enemy's attention. The Blood Killer Sect's defense line also began to attack forward with all its strength. This kind of attack The situation made the enemies a little uncomfortable. Although they were still fighting desperately, the battle line was pushed forward step by step by the people of the Blood Killing Sect.

When the disciples of the Blood Killing Sect saw this situation, their morale was greatly shaken and they kept attacking, but the enemy kept retreating. Zhao Hai and others who stood on the back of Xuanwu Island and watched all this, A smile appeared on his face, and then Zhao Hai said in a deep voice: "Okay, very good, I really didn't expect that this battle would be so easy."

Wen Wenhai said in a deep voice: "Actually, these guys are still difficult to deal with, especially their heavy cavalry charge. Even the Mo Dao soldiers dare not resist. We can only withstand the opponent's attack by relying on the spear formation, and their The shields and their armors have amazing defensive capabilities. If my armor's defensive capabilities weren't even more amazing, I probably wouldn't be able to defeat them."

Zhao Hai nodded and said: "Wuman Pai, haha, the real Wuman Pai is probably not like this, but it is better to be like this now. I just don't know what will happen next. I am I'm more interested." The reason why Zhao Hai was so relaxed was because he found that the enemy was about to be defeated. He believed that it wouldn't take long for them to defeat the enemy. He was very confident about this.

Although Zhao Hai felt that they could defeat the enemy quickly, the difficulty of defeating the enemy was still beyond their imagination. Those enemies did not retreat even when they suffered half of their casualties. In the end, they were wiped out to the seventh level. Only then did it completely disappear, and at this time, three full days had passed since the war.

After defeating this group of enemies, the territory of the Blood Killing Sect became larger and larger. Wen Wenhai and the others were arranging the expansion of the territory, but Zhao Hai led everyone back to the main hall of the Blood Killing Sect. Inside, after everyone sat down, Zhao Hai said: "The enemy has retreated again, and our territory has expanded again and again. Although this is a good thing for us, we must also pay attention to one thing. That is, the enemies that appear now are getting stronger and stronger. This time, the enemies are much stronger than the shield soldiers last time. If it were not for their small number, our losses would only be greater. I I believe everyone knows this, right?”

Everyone nodded, as Zhao Hai said, the enemies that appeared this time were indeed more powerful than the enemies they saw last time, but the number of enemies that appeared this time was not very large. The number of enemies they encountered last time was much smaller. Even so, they still fought for three days. This shows how powerful these enemies are, so they all agreed with Zhao Hai's words.

Zhao Hai then said: "The enemies we face in the future may be even more terrifying, so everyone must be mentally prepared. Seize the time, build their territory, and let all the disciples participating in the war rotate. To prepare for the possible war that will happen next, go ahead.”

Everyone responded, then turned and left. Zhao Hai looked at their backs, smiled slightly, and said nothing. He really didn't know who the other party would send to deal with him next, but he was not worried. He believed that they would definitely win. Taking this battle as an example, the people who faced the opponent this time were not the people who faced the Vine Armor Soldiers last time. There were too many disciples of the Blood Killing Sect, except for the divine machine. Except for the people in the hall who cannot participate in the war, all other disciples must participate in the war. They will all be rotated, so the disciples sent out this time are not the same group as the last time, but the weapons and equipment are the same. This is for training. disciple.
