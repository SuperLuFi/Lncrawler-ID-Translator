Here in Jusha Town, there is also a Qingyangzong store, also called Qingfeng Yangyi. This is the store where the fat shopkeeper comes now. The reason why he wants to come to Jusha Town is because of the The shopkeeper of Qingfeng Yangyi's shop is a friend of his. Both of them are servants of the Qingyang Sect, and they have been servants of the Qingyang Sect for many years without making any progress. In the end, they both became disciples at the same time. He is the shopkeeper of this store, so the relationship between the two has always been very good. .

Because the fat shopkeeper was in a hurry, he was already sweating profusely when he entered the Qingfeng Yangyi store in Jusha Town. As soon as he entered the store, a waiter immediately came up to him and pointed at the fat shopkeeper. He saluted and said, "I have met your guest. I wonder what your guest needs?"

The fat shopkeeper glanced at the waiter, and then said in a deep voice: "I came to see Yang Chen, so I told him that Wu Yang was looking for him." As he said this, he was panting. He was really exhausted, but he had no choice. If he found the people from the Ancient Sword Gang, he might still have a glimmer of hope. If he couldn't find the people from the Ancient Sword Gang, he might not even have a glimmer of hope. Those sects Disciple, if you want to kill one of their servant disciples, there is really nothing to say. If you kill him, you will kill him, and no one will stand up for them.

The waiter was stunned when he heard what the fat shopkeeper said. He was about to ask who Yang Chen was when he saw the next old guy next to him immediately saluted the fat shopkeeper and said, "Sir, it turns out you are looking for our shopkeeper. First, Come and sit here for a while. Come on, serve tea to the gentleman. I'll go find the shopkeeper right away." After saying that, the waiter ran straight to the back of the store, and Wu Yang sat down on a chair next to the store. , the guy who talked to him before immediately brought tea to Wu Yang. Wu Yang drained the tea in one gulp, took a deep breath, and then slowly calmed down.

At this moment, I saw two people walking out from the back of the store. The one walking in front was a thin and small old man. He looked to be in his fifties, but he was only about five feet tall and very tall. As soon as he saw Wu Yang, he immediately came up to him with a smile and said, "Hahaha, Lao Wu, why are you here? Come on, go to the backyard, let's have a good drink."

Wu Yang also stood up, walked to the old man, and said to the old man: "I'm in a hurry, let's go to the backyard to talk." After saying that, he walked to the backyard first. His reaction was such that he called Yang Chen's thin shopkeeper was startled. He quickly said to a waiter next to him: "Keep an eye on the shop and don't let anyone enter the backyard." After that, he followed Wu Yang into the backyard.

When the two of them arrived in the backyard, before Yang Chen could say anything, Wu Yang immediately said: "Old Yang, you must help me this time, otherwise I'm afraid I will really be doomed." Wu Yang had a look on his face. Looking at Yang Chen sadly, he really felt like he had no way out now.

Yang Chen was taken aback and said quickly: "What's wrong? Tell me quickly." Yang Chen had a good relationship with Wu Yang. Wu Yang had helped him before, so he was also very concerned about Wu Yang's affairs. Now when he saw Wu Yang like this, he couldn't help being shocked. He really didn't know what was going on with Wu Yang.

Wu Yang smiled bitterly and followed Yang Chen into the room. After sitting down in the living room, he told Yang Chen exactly what happened. Then he said: "Originally, this matter was nothing special. It’s just a gang. It’s actually not difficult for us to deal with it. If we can really deal with this Ancient Sword Gang, then our income will be greatly increased. But we didn’t expect that this Ancient Sword Gang doesn’t know where it comes from. After getting the news, he ran away directly. We couldn't find him near Linyuan Town. Now I can only come here. I hope you can help me search here in Jusha Town. Look. Let’s see if I can find any trace of the Ancient Sword Gang, I must find them as soon as possible.”

Yang Chen frowned and said: "Old Wu, you are too greedy. Who are we people? We are just servants and disciples. We can buy some medicinal materials at low prices and make some profit from them, but there is nothing we can do. It's too much. You just went too far this time. That's all. We'll talk about this later. I'd better help you find you first. Just wait. I'll make arrangements right away. I believe it will be done soon. There's news." After saying that, he walked out directly.

Wu Yang didn't say anything, he just sat there with a painful look on his face. Of course he knew that he had gone too far, but the matter had already happened, and there was no use regretting it now. He just wanted to save his life. It is very clear that although his store is not big and is located in a place like Linyuan Town, it can still bring a lot of profits to the people behind him every year. If because of his relationship, the people behind him can , if he doesn't get those benefits, then he is really dead.

After a while, Yang Chen came back from outside. He sat in front of Wu Yang. Looking at Wu Yang's appearance, his brows couldn't help but wrinkled. Then he said in a deep voice: "Old Wu, we found the people from the Gujian Gang. You What are you going to do? You are not really asking the adults behind you to take action, are you? If the adults behind you know that you have made things like this, you will probably not get any good results, right?"

Wu Yang smiled bitterly and said: "It's too late. I've already asked that adult. It's too late to say anything now. What else can I do? Lao Yang, what do you think I should do now? I really have nothing. I have an idea, even if I kill all the people in the Gujian Gang now, I’m afraid it won’t be of any use, right?”

Yang Chen frowned and thought for a while, then said in a deep voice: "Now you have only two options to choose from. One, after finding the people from the Gujian Gang, kill them directly. But in this case, I'm afraid you won't be able to do it either." You will live a good life. You should know that what those adults want is not the death of the Gujian Gang. Those adults don’t care whether the people of the Gujian Gang live or die. What they want is the people of the Gujian Gang who can Help them earn spiritual stones, so if you do this, it has no use except to vent your anger."

"Second, find the people from the Gujian Gang and negotiate with them directly. You can tell them to ensure their safety, or even increase the transaction price of their medicinal materials. Just let them trade with you again. , if they agree, you will go back to Linyuan Town immediately, then apologize to that adult, blame all the things on the guy from Xuanjia Sect, and assure that adult that the medicinal materials business here in Linyuan Town is not You will be affected in any way. Only in this way can that adult possibly forgive you. However, there are some prerequisites for doing so, that is, you must first find the people from the Gujian Gang. You don’t have to worry here in Jusha Town. As long as Gu If people from the Jian Gang appear in the town, I will definitely know. The key is the other two towns, even Linyuan Town. What if people from the Gu Jian Gang appear there? What if other people People from several sects will find the people from the Ancient Sword Gang first, what will you do then?"

When Wu Yang heard what Yang Chen said, he couldn't help but frowned and said: "What should I do? I have no choice now. We in Linyuan Town don't have a few communication circles in total. I can't monitor too many people at once." place, if the people from the Gujian Gang don’t come to Jusha Town, then I won’t be able to find them first.”

Yang Chen thought for a moment and said in a deep voice: "Let's go back to Linyuan Town right now. Leave the affairs here to me. I also have friends like this in the other two towns. I'll ask them to help." Help, keep an eye out for me. If people from the Gujian Gang appear in those two towns, I should be able to get the news right away, and I will tell you directly then."

Wu Yang thought for a while, nodded and said: "Okay, I'll leave it to you. If people from the Gujian Gang really show up, you can have full authority to talk to them on my behalf, as long as they can continue to cooperate with me. , then there is no problem in giving them some benefits, Lao Yang, whether I can survive this time depends entirely on you."

Yang Chen nodded, and then said: "After you return to Linyuan Town, don't go into the town first, and don't let anyone know that you have gone back. You should hide and see if anyone from the Gujian Gang will show up." In Linyuan Town, if they show up in Linyuan Town, you can negotiate with them immediately. If people know that you have gone back, they will be wary of you, and the effect may not be good. Do you understand what I mean? ?”

Wu Yang was stunned for a moment, then he immediately nodded and said: "I understand, okay, then I'll go back now, Lao Yang, I'll leave it to you." After that, he stood up and saluted Yang Chen, Then he walked directly out. Looking at him, he was indeed very anxious.

Yang Chen sent Wu Yang out of the store, looked at Wu Yang's retreating figure, and couldn't help but murmured: "I never thought that there would be such a gang of casual cultivators in this world, and they could force the sect's shops to surrender. Not bad. , I have the means, and I am even more curious about the people of the Ancient Sword Gang." As he said this, he walked towards the backyard.

Not long after Yang Chen returned to the backyard, a waiter ran to the backyard and went directly to Yang Chen's room. Then he shouted into the room: "Shopkeeper, there is news." This waiter was the same person as before. The guy who helped Wu Yang find Yang Chen seemed to be Yang Chen's confidant.

Yang Chen immediately said: "Xiao Huo, come in." The guy responded, opened the door and walked in. Then he saluted Yang Chen. Yang Chen waved his hand and immediately asked: "Xiao Huo. "Didn't you say there was news? What news? Have you found someone from the Gujian Gang?" What Yang Chen is most concerned about now is this matter.

Xiao Huo immediately said: "Yes, shopkeeper, the Qinglong Gang just sent news. He said that a group of people just came to the small formation. There were only three people in this group. They went directly to Meiyu Wuxia in the small town. In the store, I conducted a transaction of medicinal materials with the people in the store. The transaction volume was large and the medicinal materials were not bad. It was not an amount that could be collected by just a few people. Among the group of people, the leader had a big beard. There were two others, one had a scar on his face, and the other looked very ordinary, nothing special. He also said that those three people were ready to leave the town now, and he suspected that they were the people we were looking for. So the news was sent to us right away.”
