Just when Zhao Hai and Wen Wenhai finished speaking, the battle on the front line finally changed. The Mo Dao soldiers on both sides had reached one point, and some people fell down from time to time, while others also fought to one point. The entire front line The sound of killing was loud, but the group of black-armored cavalry who had been paying attention to Zhao Hai did not move.

The army of the Tang Dynasty was indeed very powerful, but the disciples of the Blood Killing Sect were not weaklings either. The two sides fought back and forth, but the disciples of the Blood Killing Sect had the upper hand. There was only one reason, that is, their weapons were more sophisticated. The Blood Killer Sect was stronger than their opponent in terms of armor and weapons, so naturally they slowly gained the upper hand.

Zhao Hai said in a deep voice: "When did the black-armored cavalry of the opponent's central army move out? Let our orc cavalry go up. The key to this battle is on that group of black-armored cavalry. We will kill them with blood." Disciples of Zong, I am not worried at all about the infantry. Only the black-armored cavalry is the most terrifying opponent. Remember the masked cavalry we faced last time? This cavalry is more powerful than The cavalryman with the mask is even more powerful."

Hearing what Zhao Hai said, Wen Wenhai couldn't help but be startled. He immediately responded and then went to prepare. When Zhao Hai took a look, he found that Wen Wenhai had mobilized many more heavy armored cavalry from the orc tribe. Very quickly. Obviously Wen Wenhai was not at ease, because the black armored cavalry of the instant noodle army was much more numerous than the five hundred fine cavalry of King Lanling.

Zhao Hai did not object to Wen Wenhai's approach. After all, Wen Wenhai did this to ensure the safety of the Blood Killing Sect. If the Xuanjia Cavalry really broke through their army's defense line, the consequences would be really disastrous, so Zhao Hai Hai did not object to Wen Wenhai's approach.

In fact, Zhao Hai and the others are already very far away from the front line. The Blood Killing Sect already has strategic depth. Even if there is a problem on the front line, they can send troops from the rear to fight against it. But in that case, their losses will be great, so None of them want this to happen.

The reason why Zhao Hai and the others can see the situation on the front line and the opponent's army now is because they see it as a projection, so every move on the front line can be seen in their eyes. This kind of projection cannot It only comes from the magic formations on the front line, and also from the bloody battle fort on the front line.

Although the Blood Killing Battle Fort cannot directly participate in the battle, they can record all the situation on the front line and send it to Zhao Hai and the others. Zhao Hai and the others can use the projection array to see the situation on the front line clearly. Because of this, Zhao Hai and the others can stand on the backs of Xuanwu Island and direct the frontline operations.

Of course, under normal circumstances, they rarely give direct orders to the front line. The command power of the front line is still in the hands of the front line commanders. Only at the most critical time, they will give direct orders. Zhao Hai and the others are very It is clear that no matter how they direct here, only the frontline commanders know the situation best. It is better to leave this kind of frontline command power to the frontline commanders.

The number of Tang troops attacking this time was about 5 billion, which was more than 10 billion less than the Han army that fought them before. However, these more than 5 billion Tang troops brought a great deal of trouble to the Blood Killing Sect. In terms of casualties, when they faced the Han army before, the ratio of casualties between the Blood Killer Sect and the Han army was about one to five, but now the ratio between them and the Tang army is only about one to two. In other words, every time a blood is lost, The disciples of the Killing Sect could only kill two soldiers of the Tang Dynasty. Such casualties were really terrifying.

It can be said that the front line has completely disappeared from the ancient war, but this is also a huge test for the disciples of the Blood Killing Sect, and it is even their best learning opportunity. The disciples of the Blood Killing Sect can see that, Those soldiers of the Tang Dynasty are not as good as them in terms of skills and tactics, but they are brave, tenacious, and not afraid of death. As long as they are not fatally injured, they will fight, even if you put a gun into their In their stomachs, as long as they were given a chance, they would immediately retaliate. The fighting power of these people surprised the disciples of the Blood Killing Sect.

This was the first time that the disciples of the Blood Killing Sect fought against such a fierce and fearless army. It was precisely because of this that the disciples of the Blood Killing Sect suffered heavy casualties. Of course, the casualties of the Tang army were even heavier, and the two sides fought like this. In one day, the casualties had reached more than 10 million. This was only the casualties of the Blood Killing Sect disciples, while the enemy's casualties had reached nearly 30 million.

Faced with this situation, Zhao Hai couldn't help but feel bursts of heartache. He looked at the Black Armor Cavalry of the Tang Dynasty. The Black Armor Cavalry was still motionless. It seemed that they had no intention of making any move. Hai's face couldn't help but look a little heavy. The more the enemy can keep their composure, the more powerful they will be when they burst out. The later the enemy takes action, the more casualties the Blood Killing Sect will suffer. , but there was nothing he could do, which gave Zhao Hai a headache.

The battle is still going on. When two equally powerful armies confront each other, the final outcome will be corpses everywhere. Zhao Hai has no way to deal with this situation, and the others in the Blood Killing Sect have no way to do it either. Now The disciples of the Blood Killing Sect have become angry, and they are attacking more fiercely.

Don't forget that the disciples of the Blood Killing Sect have learned the methods of the Blood Killing Sect themselves. When they were practicing, they were exposed to the murderous aura and even learned how to use the murderous aura. It is precisely because of this that the Blood Killing Sect became the All of his disciples have a bloody spirit, and they even desire to fight. This has never changed.

When facing other enemies before, all the blood in their bodies was aroused. They also felt that the murderous aura in their bodies was getting heavier. They could control more and more murderous aura, which made their attack power also become They became even stronger, and this time they met such a well-matched opponent, it completely activated the murderous aura in their bodies. The murderous aura drove their blood, which made them more warlike, without any trace of them. of fear.

And the enemies they faced naturally had no fear at all, because they were just a group of illusions. They were not sword spirits like Gongsun Auntie. They were ordinary illusions. How could they know how to be afraid, so the battle continued. Extremely tragic.

Looking at this situation, Zhao Hai could only sigh impatiently. The disciples of the Blood Killing Sect were all very powerful in combat, and the enemies were equally powerful. After this battle, for the Blood Killing Sect's disciples, For the disciples, it is definitely a good thing. As long as they can defeat the enemy, the disciples of the Blood Killing Sect will gain stronger confidence. Similarly, they will never feel afraid when facing dangerous situations in the future.

The battle continued, one day, two days, three days, four days, five days. On the fifth day of the war, the casualties on both sides were calculated in the hundreds of millions. The Blood Killing Sect lost 200 million this time. Around 500 million people were killed, and the Tang army also lost about 500 million people. Such casualties are really shocking.

But Zhao Hai and the others never went to rest and kept paying attention to the situation on the battlefield. The black-armored cavalry of the opponent's central army did not move, so the orcs of the Blood Killing Sect also did not move. To be honest, Zhao Hai still didn't move. I'm really curious, why haven't the Black Armor Cavalry from the other side's central army been dispatched? Why is this?

Just when Zhao Hai was puzzled, Wen Wenhai suddenly received the news. Wen Wenhai picked up the news and looked at it. His face couldn't help but change. He immediately said to Zhao Hai: "Boss, something happened. The enemy's blackmail The armored cavalry suddenly appeared on our two wings and suddenly launched an attack on our defenders from both our wings. Our defenders were poorly prepared and were broken through by the enemy on both wings. Now two groups of enemy cavalry are attacking from our two wings. , rushed straight towards the Chinese army on our front line. If they really rushed into our Chinese army, then our Chinese army might be in chaos. By that time, if the enemy takes the opportunity to attack, then we It’s going to be defeated.”

When Zhao Hai heard what Wen Wenhai said, he couldn't help being stunned, but then he laughed. He looked at the two flags of the Tang Army, smiled slightly and said: "As expected of the Khan of Heaven, he is really powerful, he actually used After this move, the order was sent, and the beast cavalry was divided into two teams to meet the enemy's two cavalry. They must block the charge of the enemy's cavalry, and then ordered the alien cavalry to be prepared. If the enemy's cavalry from the Chinese army attacks our front line, If we charge, they will go up to us. I don’t care how many people they will die, they must block the enemy’s attack for me, so go ahead.”

Wen Wenhai responded and immediately went to deliver the order. At this time, Zhao Hai waved his hand, and the situation on the two wings also appeared in front of Zhao Hai. He saw two black-armored heavy cavalry on the two wings of the Blood Killing Sect. Charging forward, the disciples of the Blood Killing Sect, although they were resisting with all their strength, they could not block the impact of the black armored heavy cavalry. The defense lines were broken one after another, and the Blood Killing Sect disciples were killed one by one.

Behind the black-armored heavy cavalry, there were still some cavalry, but these cavalry were no longer heavy cavalry. They rushed in with the black-armored heavy cavalry, mainly to completely tear open the holes on the two wings of the Blood Killing Sect. Behind those cavalry, there were countless infantrymen. These infantrymen were all holding horizontal swords and charging forward. They didn't hold shields in their hands, and they didn't even wear armor. Because of this, their The action is even faster, and the killing speed is very fast.

Zhao Hai looked at the two heavy armored cavalry as arrows with a calm face. Their goal was very simple, which was the position of the central army on the front line of the Blood Killing Sect. If they were really allowed to rush to the central army on the front line of the Blood Killing Sect, There, the front line of the Blood Killing Sect will definitely be in chaos. By that time, the Blood Killing Sect may really be defeated.

However, Zhao Hai did not look too worried. He just looked at these calmly, while Wen Wenhai and the others had already sent orders. Not only were the two orc heavy cavalry mobilized, but the alien cavalry were also ready. Behind the front line, Wen Wenhai ordered another line of defense to be deployed at a time, the scale of which was similar to that of the front line. Even if the front line was really defeated, this second line of defense could still block the enemy's charge. After all, the Blood Killing Sect disciples Such long training and so many battles are not the end of the story.
