c7021 fight to the death

There was a roar on the ground, and the Tang Army Xuanjia Cavalry who were charging forward also felt the unusual movement on the ground. They looked around, wanting to know what happened, and soon they When they saw it, they saw a heavy cavalry covered in white, with a cavalryman riding a tall horse appearing in their eyes. Both the cavalryman and the horse were wearing heavy armor, and they were holding weapons in their hands. The long horses were running at no slow speed. As they ran, the earth seemed to be shaking.

As soon as the Tang Army's Xuanjia Cavalry saw these cavalry, they knew that these cavalry were coming towards them, but they did not retreat or have any intention of getting out of the way. They rushed directly towards the cavalry. They are confident that any enemy who faces them will be defeated by them, and no one can stop their progress.

But unfortunately, what they didn't know was that their enemies thought the same way. The two armies, both of which had strong self-confidence, were getting closer and closer. No one retreated. Both sides raised their horses and fought bloody battles. Zong's orc cavalry even went berserk, and their figures became even taller.

Two torrents of steel collided face to face, and a loud bang was heard. The color of the world changed. The two torrents, one black and the other white, collided face to face, as if they were two equally powerful torrents. , countless waves scattered like they collided face to face, and these waves were countless people. Those people were hit by the huge impact and flew directly, but the two torrents did not stop. After coming down, it still kept moving forward, but kept flying up again. No one took a step back.

Just when the two torrents collided, the Qingqi following the Tang Army scattered and attacked, as did the soldiers holding horizontal knives following the Qingqi. They began to attack in all directions, hoping to expand their results, but Although the disciples of the Blood Killing Sect could not withstand the impact of the heavy armored cavalry, they were not afraid at all when facing them. They organized themselves in the shortest time and formed battle formations one by one to compete with these light cavalry. Fighting with infantry.

Just when the two wings of the Blood Killing Sect were finally saved, the black armor cavalry of the Tang Army suddenly started to move. They moved forward slowly at first, then faster and faster, and finally the speed had completely increased. , and finally turned into an unstoppable torrent.

So all the soldiers of the Tang Army made way for this torrent, and the infantry of the Blood Killing Sect also made way for them. At this moment, a cavalry of the Blood Killing Sect rushed out directly, and they all rode on The aliens, with lances in their hands, rushed towards the Tang Army's Xuanjia Cavalry one by one without fear of death.

The two torrents soon collided together. The impact of the Tang Army's Black Armor Cavalry was really astonishing, but the Blood Killing Sect's alien cavalry was also the most elite force in the Blood Killing Sect. In terms of combat effectiveness, they Its combat effectiveness is still stronger than that of the orc cavalry.

Although they actually suffered a lot from the head-on charge with the heavy cavalry, their combat effectiveness was definitely not weak. The two sides collided head-on. Although the Blood Killing Sect's alien cavalry were scattered together at first, the Black Armor Cavalry They charged forward for a while, but their speed became slower and slower, and finally they were blocked by the alien cavalry.

Now everyone on the battlefield is paying attention to the collision of cavalry in these three places. It can be said that the victory or defeat of the collision of cavalry is directly related to the victory or defeat of this war, so everyone has focused their attention. Here, although the fighting in other places continues, it has become less intense.

Finally, the black armor cavalry on both wings slowly disappeared. There were not many of them, and they were far less numerous than the orc cavalry of the Blood Killing Sect. They were completely consumed, but the orc cavalry did not stop and gave the black armor cavalry to them. After they were completely wiped out, they followed the Xuanjia Cavalry's attack route and killed them back. All the Tang Army's light cavalry who wanted to block them were knocked away by them. They used the Tang Army's attack method to push back. This is true on both wings.

Due to the counterattack of the orc cavalry, the Blood Killing Sect's army also took the opportunity to counterattack. They surrounded the Tang Army on both wings and prepared to encircle and annihilate them. However, the Tang Army who were surrounded in the middle did not move for a moment. The fighting stopped, and they continued to fight against the disciples of the Blood Killing Sect until the last person was killed.

As for the Chinese army, the alien cavalry also began to slowly countercharge. The heavy cavalry of the Tang army that rushed over here were pushed back. They were also defeated. When the infantry of Xuesha showed this, Despite the situation, everyone cheered, and then began to attack the Blood Killing Sect frantically.

When the last Xuanjia Cavalry in the central army was eliminated, the Tang army opposite the Blood Killing Sect completely disappeared. The disciples of the Blood Killing Sect were in such a state of extreme movement and silence that they were instantly thrown away. It took a moment, but then they understood what was going on. After almost being stunned for a moment, all the disciples immediately let out a burst of cheers.

Zhao Hai and the others also let out a sigh of relief at this time. Zhao Hai then turned to Wen Wenhai and said: "We will count the casualties, fight for the territory, and arrange the disciples at the same time. This time, the magic circle must be arranged well, because I feel that next time we The enemy we have to face may be related to the power of cultivation, and we can use the power of cultivation when the time comes."

Wen Wenhai responded and immediately went to make arrangements. The disciples of the Blood Killing Sect who participated in the battle were immediately sent back to the Xuanwu Space to rest and recuperate, while the other disciples who did not participate in the battle immediately came out of the Xuanwu Space and started When setting up the magic formation, these people have participated in the previous battles. When they participated in the previous battles, it was the same as now. After the battle, they went to rest while others came to set up the formation. Now it has been changed. , other people went to rest, and they came to set up the formation, so they didn't complain at all.

The Blood Killer Sect is already very familiar with such battles. Everyone knows what they should do. Those who are injured are being treated, and those who are not injured are going to rest immediately. Those who died in the battle have now After being resurrected, they were immediately ready to learn how to become a qualified undead clan.

After Wen Wenhai and the others arranged all this, they all gathered in the main hall of the Blood Killing Sect. Zhao Hai was also sitting in the main hall. He glanced at everyone and said solemnly: "In this battle, we suffered the greatest loss. , Wen Hai, tell me how many disciples we killed this time."

Wen Wenhai responded, stood up, and said to everyone: "This time, a total of more than 270 million of our disciples died in the battle. It can be said that this is the heaviest loss our Blood Killing Sect has suffered since its establishment. This time This battle also exposed some problems, such as our lack of preparation. We did not expect that the enemy would suddenly attack us from both wings. These were all things we did not expect in advance, so our losses were so heavy."

Zhao Hai waved his hand and said in a deep voice: "Now is not the time to say this, and there is no need to say this. Just remember to change it in the future. This is not that person's fault. None of us thought of this, so There is no one to blame for this matter." Wen Wenhai responded, said nothing more, and sat down quietly.

Zhao Hai looked at them and said in a deep voice: "This time we defeated the enemy, but there will be more powerful enemies waiting for us. We must defeat these enemies in order to truly get this space, and The enemy we face next will most likely have the power of the world of cultivation, which means that we can also use the power of the world of cultivation, so everyone must be mentally prepared."

When Zhao Hai said this, everyone was stunned. Some of them heard the news for the first time, so they were stunned for a moment, but then they became happy. Their fighting these days seemed like they were being tied up. It feels like I am holding my hands and feet, and I always feel that my hands are tied, but if the power of the cultivation world can really be used in the following battle, that would be great.

Zhao Hai looked at everyone's appearance and said in a deep voice: "Okay, everyone, don't be so excited. You can use the power of the cultivation world. That can only mean that our enemies will become more powerful. We must be more careful, and everyone should also Don’t be too happy too soon, you must work hard to prepare when you return, and tell all the news to the disciples below so that they must be careful.”

Everyone responded in unison, and Zhao Hai nodded and said: "Okay, let's go, let's all go down." Everyone responded, then stood up, saluted Zhao Hai, then turned around and left. Even Wen Wenhai and the others did not stay. Although the Blood Killing Sect suffered a great loss this time, the disciples only lost one life after all. They could still practice, so there was no sad atmosphere in the Blood Killing Sect. Everyone is calmly waiting for the next battle.

When the elders told the disciples that they might encounter the power of the cultivation world next time, the disciples of the Blood Killing Sect really cheered for a while. To be honest, the battles in the recent period have really shaken them. They were so frustrated that they could hardly use the power of their external incarnations. This was really a torture for them. Now that they heard that they could finally use the power of the world of cultivation, how could they not be happy.

Zhao Hai really didn't know what to say when he was so happy about the disciples of the Blood Killing Sect. Is it necessarily a good thing to be able to use the power of cultivation? That just means that their enemies will become stronger, and their losses will be greater. However, Zhao Hai didn't say anything. The disciples of the Blood Killing Sect are so happy, which can only represent their confidence in their own power. It is also a good thing to have absolute confidence, and after so many battles, they also need to vent well, so Zhao Hai has no intention of stopping them.

After being excited for a while, the disciples of the Blood Killing Sect slowly calmed down. Then one by one, they all entered the real illusion of the Blood Killing Sect. This time they went to practice in the real illusion. , in fact, this is also a way to vent, because only in the real illusion can they fight completely without worrying about their own safety. This is the best place to vent.
