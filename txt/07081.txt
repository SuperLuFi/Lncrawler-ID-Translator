Everyone nodded, and they all agreed with Wen Wenhai's words. Their current attack methods are actually not very strong, especially for those snakes. In addition to the intentional attack methods used by the disciples, other attack methods , the lethality of those snakes is actually very limited, and their enemies are always evolving. Who knows whether those snakes will evolve and are not afraid of the Five Elements Killing Formation. If it really is In that case, their good days will come to an end, so they need to be careful.

Wen Wenhai continued: "Right now, Elder Wen's research on the five-element killer energy weapon has not been completed. For the time being, our attack method can only rely on the disciple position to face those snakes head-on, and the bloody battle All the various methods of the fort cannot be used, which is very troublesome, so our attack speed cannot be too fast. Everyone must be mentally prepared for this, and at the same time, we must always pay attention to see if those snakes have any No new means have evolved.”

Everyone agreed in unison, and Wen Wenhai nodded and said: "Okay, let's rest for three days. After three days, we will expand one at a time. Okay, everyone should go back." Everyone agreed, and then everyone He stood up, saluted to Wen Wenhai, then turned and left.

After watching everyone leave, Wen Wenhai said: "I have a feeling that those snakes must have new attack methods, and maybe they will actually find a way to deal with our Five Elements Killing Formation. We must You have to be prepared for this, now I really don’t dare to underestimate those snakes.”

Chang Jun said in a deep voice: "Yeah, you really can't underestimate those snakes now. The strength of those snakes is really too strong. I don't know if their evolution will be huge. If they continue to evolve like this If so, it will definitely give us a headache.”

Wen Wenhai nodded, and then said: "Let's see, we still know too little about those snakes, so we can only passively accept the moves and see what moves the enemy will use next. We'll just take over when the time comes, let's go." After saying that, Wen Wenhai stood up and walked out, and Chang Jun also followed Wen Wenhai.

Three days passed quickly. During these three days, the disciples of the Blood Killing Sect had already laid out all the magic arrays in the new base. Although in the future, after the five-element killer energy weapon is developed, the magic arrays will still be in progress. Some adjustments, but before that, their base must be paved with these magic arrays. These magic circles can not only be used as energy weapons, but also increase the energy of the base, so these magic circles must be established. of.

The original attack frequency of the Blood Killing Sect was about ten days, but this time it was increased to three days because they had not attacked for many days before. They wanted to increase the frequency of attacks to make their attack speed faster. Faster, they increased the frequency of their attacks a lot.

And now the Blood Killing Sect’s base has also added a defensive measure, which is the previous internal defense in the base. In the past, they would not be able to defeat the internal defense in the base, but now they have always turned on the internal defense in the base. They were worried that if those snakes really invaded their base, they could use the base's internal defense to fight those snakes, and they would not let those snakes see clearly what was going on in the base at a glance.

After three days of rest, the disciples for this attack were all ready. Following Wen Wenhai's order, all the large-scale magical weapons of the Blood Killing Sect rushed out of the base and began to attack the Shadow Clan's power of law. , began to attack. This time their attack was still so smooth. The giant pythons still couldn't stop them, and the disciples of the Blood Killing Sect also rushed out of the base one after another, preparing to attack the giant pythons. .

But what surprised the disciples of the Blood Killing Sect was that the giant pythons seemed to have no energy. They seemed not to want to fight with the disciples of the Blood Killing Sect. Although they were still blocking the attack of the Blood Killing Sect disciples, they did not It was not as brave as the previous attacks, but mainly fighting. This change was quickly discovered by Jiang Shenglin, who directed this attack. Jiang Shenglin himself was a very meticulous person, so when he saw those giants The python suddenly changed its fighting style, and he immediately realized that there must be something wrong with it. After thinking of this, he immediately reported the matter.

After receiving Jiang Shenglin's report, Wen Wenhai's face changed slightly. Then he immediately paid attention to the fighting situation in the projection. Sure enough, as Jiang Shenglin said, those giant pythons were only fighting, but there was no Fighting with the disciples of the Blood Killing Sect with all his strength, Wen Wenhai's expression finally changed completely. He immediately said loudly: "Everyone, come to the conference room for a meeting. Hurry." After that, he flew straight to the conference room. Go, flying back and forth while informing the elders who were not nearby, looking very anxious.

Chang Jun had been standing next to Wen Wenhai before, so he naturally heard Jiang Shenglin's report. Precisely because he heard it, he understood Wen Wenhai's current reaction very well, so he didn't say anything. He flew directly to the conference room, and among the people present, only two people had the highest status. Now that the two of them were acting like this, the others would naturally not react in any other way, and immediately followed the two of them and flew into the conference room. go.

Soon the two of them arrived at the conference room. After entering the conference room, Wen Wenhai waited for everyone to sit down and immediately said: "Elder Jiang just sent me a letter saying that the colorful pythons outside suddenly changed them. They no longer fight against our Blood Killing Sect disciples, but focus on fighting. It seems that they want to delay the attack of our Blood Killing Sect disciples. I don’t know what everyone knows about this matter. What do you think?"

When Wen Wenhai said this, everyone was in an uproar. They were not fools. They knew what it meant. It meant that the enemy might have new methods to deal with them. When they thought of this, their faces changed. It all became unsightly.

At this moment, Chen Chu, who had not gone to command the team today, suddenly stood up and said to Wen Wenhai: "Elder Wen, I would like to ask if our blood-killing battle forts outside have been attacked. They encountered What kind of attack is it? This will also help us determine the current situation."

Upon hearing what Chen Chu said, Wen Wenhai was stunned for a moment, then nodded and said in a deep voice: "Okay, I'll ask now." Then he immediately took out the communication array and directed the bloody battle Tang Yingyi from the fort wrote a letter, and Tang Yingyi's answer made Wen Wenhai stunned, because they met the strongest resistance attack from those giant pythons.

Because everyone in the conference room also wanted to know what kind of attack the Blood Killing Battle Fort encountered, so they all listened attentively. When they heard what Tang Yingyi said, they were all stunned. After Tang Yingyi finished speaking, Chen Chu said: "Elder Wen, I think the enemy may be attacking again. This time their evolution is likely to be related to our Five Elements Killing Formation."

When Wen Wenhai heard what he said, he couldn't help being slightly stunned, and then immediately asked: "How can you see it?" He was stunned by what Chen Chu said, because he really hadn't thought why Chen Chu was so sure. , the enemy will evolve at the same time, and the evolution at the same time is related to the Five Elements Killing Formation.

Chen Chu said solemnly: "Every time the enemy evolves, it is aimed at our weaknesses and their own weaknesses. They make their weaknesses stronger, and then evolve their attack methods to target our weaknesses, so Every time they attack, they will give us a huge headache, and now they are no longer attacking our disciples of the Blood Killing Sect, but just fighting. It is probably because they have no way to evolve in this aspect, because from the perspective of our relationship with the Shadow Sect, Until now, we haven’t encountered any Shadow Tribe people who can use Chu Yi, so I think it is very likely that they have no way to evolve in this area, but they are also fighting against those who are protected by the Five Elements Killing Formation. They have been unable to break through the Five Elements Killing Formation, but why are they still attacking desperately? Thinking about the black snakes that appeared at the beginning, they absorb abilities. Even now, those snakes They can also absorb energy. After they absorb the energy, they will transfer the energy to the power of the Shadow Clan Law. Now those snakes are desperately attacking the Blood Killing Castle because they want to absorb some Five Elements Jue through this attack. The energy in the killing array is sent back to the power of the Shadow Clan's laws, and the power of the Shadow Clan's laws will be adjusted according to this energy, allowing those snakes to evolve methods for the Five Elements Killing Formation. Come on, I think this is the way those snakes have always evolved. They use this method to evolve slowly, so we always feel that every time they evolve, they are targeting their own weaknesses and our weaknesses. Evolution."

Upon hearing what Chen Chu said, everyone nodded involuntarily. They knew very well that what Chen Chu said might be on point. This is how the enemy evolved, and they just wanted to use this method of evolution, bit by bit. Perfect themselves, and then attack the Blood Killing Sect until the Blood Killing Sect has no other means. Then they can directly fight against the Blood Killing Sect until they are eliminated.

Wen Wenhai couldn't help but nodded, and then said: "It makes sense, it makes sense. What Chen Chu said makes perfect sense. The enemy may have really evolved in this way. They are now attacking the Blood Killing Battle Fort. Although there will be a lot of losses, they can afford such losses, and every time they attack, they can absorb a little of the power of the Five Elements Killing Formation, and then they can target this kind of loss. Strength, make targeted adjustments, and once they have adjusted well and found a way, it is time for them to evolve. After they evolve, they will attack the Blood Killing Sect at once. When they attack the Blood Killing Sect at once, When killing the sect, the people of the Blood Killing Sect will find that the enemy does not seem to be afraid of their Five Elements Killing Formation, and may even break the Five Elements Killing Formation, bringing danger to the Blood Killing Sect.
