"It has been confirmed. It is indeed the army of the Yasha clan. They are coming towards us and have already set up a formation. It seems that they want to fight with us. It's strange why they suddenly want to Came over to fight us? Is there something weird here?" Chang Jun stood in front of the projection and asked Wen Wenhai.

Wen Wenhai looked at the projection and said in a deep voice: "No matter what weirdness they have, people are knocking on the door. We have to follow them. Just come, we will continue. Send the order and let them get ready." , By the way, tell those who use Mantianhuo not to use new arrows, but be sure to shoot out all the old arrows before using new arrows."

A messenger next to him responded, then turned and left. After the man left, Wen Wenhai turned to Chang Jun and said, "They are out now. It's a good thing. Let's take care of them. I'll take care of them." I want to see what these yakshas are planning."

Chang Jun smiled and said: "Just come here, there is nothing to say. In fact, I think we have wasted enough time here, and we should resolve the matter here earlier. This time Let’s teach those Yakshas a lesson first and let them know how powerful we are.”

Wen Wenhai smiled and nodded without saying anything. At this time, on their front line, Gu Yuanzheng was commanding the disciples of the Blood Killing Sect, lining up in formation. Beside him, Shun Li and King of Hell were all there. Gu Yuanzheng was still the commander of the front line, although They are expanding in all directions, but in fact they are still mainly focused on the ancient expedition.

Gu Yuanzheng turned around and smiled at the two of them: "I don't know why those Yashas went crazy this time, but they rushed over directly. But they came just in time. I'm tired of dealing with those guys in the city every day. , finally we have a group of capable opponents, and I really want to have a good fight."

Shun Li smiled slightly and said: "This is indeed good. A good fight is not necessarily a bad thing for us. Okay, let's not talk about this. Lao Gu, our alien Yaksha clan is also We're ready for battle, don't forget us." Shu Li also wanted to let the alien Yaksha join the battle, so that's why he said this.

Gu Yuanzheng nodded, and then said with a smile: "No problem, don't worry, I will never forget you. When you faced the Yaksha clan before, you fought well enough and scared away those Yakshas. Then We fought with great prestige in one battle, but now the only ones who can guarantee the morale of our Blood Killing Sect are you and us. Now I understand why the young master is so fond of our two clans."

The King of Hell said in a deep voice: "It's not just because of this, but this time's problem really gave us a wake-up call. Lao Gu, you should also pay attention to the morale of those monks and don't let them attack our people." What impact will it have? What happened this time is actually very dangerous."

Of course they were talking about the emotional changes of some disciples of the Blood Killing Sect in the recent period. Some ordinary disciples of the Blood Killing Sect did not know about this matter, but they, the senior officials, knew about it. To be honest, they were all very surprised after hearing those words, because the Blood Killer Sect attaches great importance to military merit. If you have military merit, you have everything, better training materials, better techniques, All these are exchanged for military merit, so no one of the disciples of the Blood Killing Sect is afraid of war, and they are even looking forward to it.

But at this moment, it was suddenly discovered that some disciples were in the mood to fight, and some disciples had become bloodthirsty because they had fought too many battles. How could they not be surprised? It was precisely because of surprise that So they all attached great importance to this matter, and Laura and the others responded very quickly, and various methods appeared immediately.

First it was about the exercises, and then it was about the psychology. For this reason, a temple was built for Fajing to lecture in it, and the effect turned out to be pretty good. However, under the strong request of Wen Wenhai and the others, the temple was closed to worshipers. The image is not the Buddha, but the image of Zhao Hai. Of course, Zhao Hai also has hair and is not a monk.

But this matter surprised Gu Yuanzheng and Shu Li. Their two clans are different from the disciples of the Blood Killing Sect. Whether they are the alien clan or the undead clan, their two clans have different opinions on each other. War has never been afraid of. The Alien clan is eager to fight, and even eager to die in battle, because after they die in battle, they will become the Necromancer clan and can practice normally. For the Necromancer clan, War and death are what they desire most.

After hearing the words of the King of Hell, Gu Yuanzheng snorted coldly and said: "What's so dangerous? In my opinion, this situation will only happen if we get used to them and don't practice seriously one by one. This means that in our Blood Killing Sect, if you were in another sect, who would care about your life or death."

Both Yama Ling and Shun Li smiled and did not speak. In fact, their thoughts were similar to those of Gu Yuanzheng. In other sects, if you were a low-level disciple, your life would definitely be worse than in the Blood Killing Sect. You have been sad for countless generations, and no one will take care of you, let alone whether someone cares about your emotional changes. Everything depends on you. If you get through it, then you just got through it. If you can't get through it, then you Just wait for death. If you really go crazy and become a madman, the sect's law enforcement hall will deal with you, but no one will give you a second look.

In the Blood Killing Sect, although there are many battles, every battle is a large-scale battle, and everyone cooperates with each other, and there are not many people who actually die in the battle. After all, even if they die, there are still several As for fate, under such circumstances, it is really weird that such a situation can occur.

Gu Yuanzheng was not talking about this topic, but looked ahead and said in a deep voice: "It's coming soon, let everyone get ready." The two of them agreed, and then ordered to go, and they believed it this time They put those giant beasts in the front, the army in the middle, and the Blood Killing Battle Fort at the back.

Baiyan still commands all the Blood Killing Battle Forts, but now the Blood Killing Battle Forts rarely directly participate in melee combat. They are usually used as transmitters and radars for Mantianhuo. For this, the Blood Killing Sect is extremely No one is dissatisfied. The Blood Killing Battle Castle is very important to the current Blood Killing Sect.

Soon, the army of the Yaksha clan slowly came over. Their army was also very interesting. The fat cow and the eight-legged cow were at the front, in the middle was the army of the Yaksha clan, and at the end was the floating island. The formation was almost as bloody as The Killing Sect is the same. Looking at it, you can tell that their floating island will not directly participate in the attack.

Gu Yuanzheng looked at the army of the Yaksha clan, smiled slightly and said: "They are really upright, even the formation is so formal, so let's have a good time with them, Lao Yan, get ready." The King of Hell ordered those giant beasts to take care of them. During the battle, of course, those giant beasts acted first.

The King of Hell responded, and then his order was passed on. The giant beasts were all ready. This time they were not going to talk nonsense to each other and just started to do it. Therefore, Gu Yuanzheng did not think about it. He went up and said a few words to the Lion Heart Emperor, and immediately prepared to attack.

Yasha naturally saw what they were doing here. The Lion-Hearted Emperor stood on the city wall of the floating island, looking at the giant beasts in front of the Blood Killing Sect, and snorted coldly: "Okay, let's just start fighting. Then Come on, who is still afraid of you? Send the order and prepare to attack." Someone beside him immediately responded and then went to give the order.

From this point, we can see the difference in strength between the two sides. The command here of the Yasha clan still relies on the messengers to use the teleportation array to deliver orders, but the Blood Killer Sect can directly give orders with the voice of the ground. This But there is a big difference, just like when one army is still using a transmitter to send messages, the other side has already used a mobile phone. The gap is not a small one.

Following the order of the King of Hell, the fat cows and eight-legged cows were also ready. Then it was not known which side gave the order first, maybe at the same time. The two giant beast armies rushed towards each other directly. After passing by, the army of the Blood Killer Sect and the army of Yaksha also followed behind the army of giant beasts and rushed forward.

There was no trick, and no one thought about what method to use. It was like two knights meeting on the battlefield. They didn't say a word, there was no trick, they just put their visors on each other. He lowered it, then leveled his spear, and charged directly towards the opponent.

Maybe their approach seems too simple, but in fact, wars are often like this. What kind of conspiracies and weirdness? These may be used when there is no war, but they are all used when the war actually starts. When the time comes, such methods are useless. What matters is strength.

The giant beasts on both sides collided fiercely. For a moment, countless giant beasts fell from the sky. Some of them fell directly to the ground and were smashed into meat patties. The giant beasts of the Blood Killing Sect Beasts, when they fall to the ground, will usually have armor on their bodies to protect them. However, those stone giant alien aliens will fall directly to the ground and turn into meat patties, but they will soon be massacred. Surrounded by black power, they will eventually turn into a skeleton, and then they will slowly stand up, but they will exit the battlefield directly from the ground and will no longer attack.

Countless giant beasts fell to the ground, and even more giant beasts slowed down after this charge. Very few giant beasts could rush towards the opponent's army, no matter it was the giant of the Blood Killing Sect. The beasts are still the giant beasts of the Yasha clan, they are all the same. Speaking of which, the giant beasts of the Blood Killing Sect can really charge towards the opponent's army, but they did not do so. Instead, they retreated directly and The battlefield was completely ceded to the armies of both sides.

The armies of both sides were in formation, and they had already begun to charge. Soon the armies of both sides were strangled together. At this time, countless sky-wide fires flew from behind the Blood Killing Sect. These sky-wide fires, Shooting straight at Yaksha's army...
