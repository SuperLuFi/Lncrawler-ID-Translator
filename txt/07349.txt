Three days passed quickly. These three days were really sad for Wen Wenhai and others who knew the truth of the matter. They had been waiting and looking forward to it, and finally three days passed. , Wen Wenhai had been waiting for Hu Changfeng in his room early.

Hu Changfeng arrived at Wen Wenhai's room at the same time. As soon as he entered Wen Wenhai's room, Hu Changfeng was stunned because he found Wen Wenhai standing in the room, looking at him anxiously. Just as Hu Changfeng was about to speak, he heard Wen Wenhai asked: "How was it? Did it succeed?"

Hu Changfeng immediately understood Wen Wenhai's mood, and he immediately smiled and said: "Don't worry, it has been successful, you don't have to worry, you can start the war directly now." Hu Changfeng was also very happy, because he brought the energy beast to It really takes no effort to fuse the blessings with the blessings of the techniques, and now their strength combined with the blessings of the techniques is about half stronger than before. This is definitely good news. .

In his opinion, this is because everyone has been training together for too short a time and cannot form perfect coordination. If they have been training together for a long time and cooperate better, then this power will definitely be greater. It is precisely because of this that Hu Changfeng is not in a hurry now.

When Wen Wenhai heard what Hu Changfeng said, he couldn't help but let out a sigh of relief, and then he burst out laughing. He looked at Hu Changfeng and said: "Okay, great, hahahaha, it's really great. Let's have a meeting right away. This good news tells everyone that our Blood Killing Sect is finally going to attack the Asura clan."

Hu Changfeng also smiled slightly, and then followed Wen Wenhai directly to the conference hall. Soon all the other core elders arrived. When those core elders saw Hu Changfeng, their eyes lit up. They knew it very well. , what does Hu Changfeng's appearance here mean, but they are all wealthy people and did not say it directly.

After everyone arrived, Wen Wenhai looked at everyone without saying a word. He laughed a few times and then said: "Seeing Lao Hu here, I think everyone knows what this means. As everyone guessed, Lao Hu succeeded, and now they can start the war with the Asura clan. This is definitely good news for us. Let us all cheer for Lao Hu. applaud."

Everyone clapped their hands vigorously, which made Hu Changfeng a little embarrassed. He saluted everyone with clasped fists. After a while, the applause stopped, and Hu Changfeng returned to his seat and sat down. Wen Wenhai's face calmed down at this time, and he then said: "Everyone knows the situation outside now. Now the Asuras outside are a little unstable again. They are preparing to attack us. Everyone What do you think about this?”

Baiyan said: "I think the Asura clan's attack this time is just a test. As you all know, the Asura clan has attacked us before, but it was to get mushrooms and dodder for research, and this time Their attack on us was not very resolute. They stopped after encountering the attacks of mushrooms and dodders. But I have seen it. Even if they were attacked by mushrooms and dodders this time, there seemed to be no harm. In response, some of the Asura clan even reached out and swept all the mushrooms on them to the ground. However, no mushrooms grew on their bodies. From this point, it can be seen that they actually They have found a way to crack mushrooms, and the same is true for dodder, so I think the Asura clan may be experimenting this time to see if they have really cracked mushrooms and dodder. Only after discovering the crack, will they start the official process. attack."

Wen Wenhai and the others all nodded. They also knew about the situation Bai Yan was talking about, and their thoughts were the same as Bai Yan's. And this was what they were most worried about. The enemy had broken through the mushrooms and dodders. Attack, then they will attack their war plant fortress in a large scale. Although they are not afraid of each other, facing such an attack will indeed give people a headache.

Gu Yuanzheng said: "It just so happens that the enemy is about to attack, and we are also about to attack, so we might as well wait a moment. It is not that easy for the enemy to attack our Zhan Zhi Fortress. Let's use the Zhan Zhi Fortress first. Push the enemy back and then take advantage of the situation to attack, only in this way can the enemy be dealt greater damage."

Wen Wenhai and the others' eyes lit up. This method of the Ancient Expedition was not a great method, but it was very effective. When the Asura clan discovered that the Blood Killing Sect had not attacked for such a long time, they might have guessed it. The reason, or they may not have guessed the reason, but regardless of whether they have guessed the reason, they will attack the Blood Killing Sect, so why don't they use it to their advantage? Wouldn't that be better?

Everyone else also nodded. They also felt that Gu Yuanzheng's method seemed to be very good. Looking at them, Gu Yuanzheng then said: "The masters of the Asura clan don't dare to deal with it. We have gone too far, otherwise, the young master will not let them go, but those ordinary Asuras will always be entangled with us. Why don’t we use this opportunity to kill them in large numbers. Anyway, the Asuras, we will eventually They are all to be destroyed.”

Everyone nodded at once, feeling that what Gu Yuanzheng said made sense. Wen Wenhai glanced at everyone, then he turned to look at Mr. Zhen, and then said: "Old Mr. Zhen, I think it's settled like this, you guys? Let’s formulate a battle plan, and after we review it, we can proceed.”

Mr. Jin is now in charge of the staff department and has great power. He will not object to Wen Wenhai's opinions, so he didn't say anything and just nodded. Even if he agreed, others would naturally not object. Wen Wenhai then said: "We only have five days to wait for the Asura clan. After five days, if they still don't attack us, then we will attack them instead, so you have to make two battle plans. One is that they attack us, we counterattack, and then take advantage of the opportunity to attack, and the other is that they don't attack us, and we attack them."

Mr. Zhen nodded once and said in a deep voice: "Okay, I understand." Wen Wenhai nodded, then turned to look at everyone and said: "Okay, everyone knows what we should do next, five days Time, if the enemy does not attack us within five days, then we will attack them. If they attack us within five days, we will repel them and then take advantage of the situation to counterattack, so everyone will start preparations as soon as they return."

Everyone responded, and then Wen Wenhai let everyone disperse. Everyone quickly left the hall and went to busy with their own affairs. They have been staying in Zhanzhi Fortress these days, and they have been there all the time. I have been holding back my training for a long time, and now I can finally attack.

After Wen Wenhai returned to his room, he immediately began to make preparations. The entire Blood Killing Sect started to move, like a war machine. After he fixed his shortcomings, he was finally ready to start. , and this time the war breaks out, they are not ready to stop.

The day after Wen Wenhai and the others had their meeting, a large-scale attack by the Asura clan began. A large number of ordinary Asuras, led by some three-headed and six-armed Asuras, rushed straight towards Zhanzhi Fortress. Of course, the Blood Killing Sect's war plant fortress was not given in vain. Those war plants immediately launched a counterattack, and the two sides soon reached a point of fighting.

But these Asuras are really difficult to deal with. The shields on their bodies seem to have added another layer, and the weapons in their hands have also changed. Their weapons are also covered with a layer of shields. Black smoke, and many war plants were attacked by their weapons, and they were interrupted immediately, which shows how powerful their weapons are.

Wen Wenhai naturally received the news, and he immediately ordered that the Blood Killing Sect disciples begin to fight back. Originally, they thought that even if the Asura clan wanted to attack, they would wait for a few days, but they did not expect that they would attack so quickly. , but this also left Wen Wenhai and the others with no other choice but to fight.

Of course, ordinary disciples of the Blood Killing Sect can deal with these Asura clan without Hu Changfeng and others. The new energy beast blessing created by the Blood Killing Sect also shows its power. This energy beast blessing is different from the ordinary blessing. It's a little different. He's visible. It looks a bit like a blessing from a martial arts technique, but it's not a blessing from a martial arts technique.

The so-called ordinary blessings refer to the armors and incarnations of the Blood Killing Sect that provide blessings to the Blood Killing Sect disciples. These blessings are actually very important to the Blood Killing Sect disciples, but they are not visible. It just sits on the bodies of Blood Killing Sect disciples like armor, and outsiders cannot see this blessing.

The manifestation blessing is different. Appearance blessing means that after this kind of blessing, there will be an external form that is displayed so that people can clearly see this kind of blessing. For the disciples of the Blood Killing Sect, But it is very important, because the manifestation blessing will have some unexpected effects. It can not only become the first layer of protective cover for the Blood Killing Sect disciples, but also increase the attack area of ​​the Blood Killing Sect disciples. This is very important. of.

It is said that he is the first layer of protective shield because if you do not break through this visible blessing, you will not be able to attack the Blood Killer Sect's own body, and it is impossible to cause any harm to him, so he is said to be the Blood Killer Sect. The first layer of protective shield for disciples. This is more obvious in the physical shape of the disciples. Once the disciples of the Blood Killing Sect use the Eight Blood Fighting Styles, a river of blood will fall from the sky, which will completely destroy the body shape of the disciples of the Blood Killing Sect. Submerged, not only can the enemy not be able to attack the disciples of the Blood Killing Sect, but they can't even see his body in the Blood River. This is also a kind of protection.

Increasing the attack area is easier to understand. Just like a river of blood, if a person blows it down with a knife, how big will the attack area be? How large is the attack area of ​​a blood river? The attack area of ​​the blood river is naturally much larger than the attack area of ​​the sword. This is the benefit of the visible blessing.
