Zhao Hai punched the ghost king directly, but the tiger-head sledgehammer in the ghost king's hand hit Zhao Hai head-on. Zhao Hai shouted loudly, and then punched the sledgehammer above his head. When he hit it, a loud bang was heard. The sledgehammer was knocked back by Zhao Hai's punch, and the ghost king also stepped back. At this moment, Xu Shi and Xu Yuan's The two flying swords also stabbed directly at the Ghost King.

The Ghost King also roared wildly, and then he stabilized his figure. Then bursts of black smoke suddenly appeared from his body. The black smoke split into two streams and went straight towards the two flying swords. The rotation of the sword immediately dispersed the black smoke, but the speed of the flying sword also slowed down.

At this time, Zhao Hai immediately rushed over and punched the ghost king again. The tiger-head sledgehammer in the ghost king's hand flew up and down, and he fought with Zhao Hai. The two of them rolled over there. Yes, the fight was lively, and Xu Shi and Xu Yuan kept harassing the Ghost King with flying swords. The Ghost King slowly fell into a disadvantage.

Just after the two flying swords made several wounds on the Ghost King's body, the Ghost King suddenly stepped back and immediately exited the circle. Then he roared, and then his body moved. A black tiger appeared. Its fierce body was about twenty meters long and about ten meters tall. It raised its head to the sky and let out a long roar, then rushed towards Zhao Hai.

When he saw the fierce tiger, Zhao Hai couldn't help being stunned, and then said loudly: "Faxiang? Hold him." Then he also stepped back, and Xu Shi and Xu Yuan's faces were also very ugly. They were really They didn't expect that this ghost king would actually have a Dharma form, but the two of them still took out a handful of talismans and threw them towards the tiger. They knew what Zhao Hai meant. Zhao Hai wanted them to hold the tiger back. The tiger then called out the Dharma image himself.

There was an explosion, and all the talisman papers exploded, but the tiger seemed not to feel it and still rushed forward. In a blink of an eye, it was in front of Xu Shi and Xu Yuan. Their expressions changed. The figure retreated to the side, and the tiger did not attack them, but rushed straight towards Zhao Hai. It was obvious that he thought Zhao Hai was the most threatening person to him.

At this time, Zhao Hai's figure suddenly swayed, and a giant ape appeared around him. As soon as the giant ape came out, it looked up to the sky and roared, and then rushed towards the tiger, one tiger and one tiger. The tiger was beaten loudly by the ape, but in the end, the tiger was still not inferior to the giant ape. The giant ape pinned him to the ground and punched him for a while. The tiger was immediately scattered, revealing the ghost general inside the tiger. Then the giant ape roared wildly. , the ghost general was scattered with one punch, and the ghost general disappeared directly, leaving only a tiger-headed sledgehammer on the ground.

Then the giant ape disappeared, revealing Zhao Hai's figure. Zhao Hai's face was a little pale, but luckily, there was no other reaction. Then Zhao Hai made a move, and the sledgehammer fell into his hand. , he waved it twice, and the sledgehammer made roaring sounds. Zhao Hai nodded with satisfaction, then waved his hand and put the sledgehammer away. Then he looked at the general's mansion and sighed. He said in a voice: "Let's go to the general's mansion and see what is there.

The two of them agreed, and then followed Zhao Hai and flew straight to the general's mansion. When they arrived at the general's mansion, they were stunned because the general's mansion was actually full of people. Stone man, and everything in the general's mansion is made of stone. Tables made of stone, chairs made of stone, cups made of stone, everything is made of stone.

Stone men, stone dogs, and even chickens made of stone. Every stone man in this mansion has a smile on his face. If they were not made of stone, this general mansion would be very lively. It is a pity that , now all the people here are stone men, which will only make this mansion look extremely weird.

Zhao Hai took a look at the situation in the general's mansion and couldn't help but smile bitterly, and then said in a deep voice: "This should be where the ghost general's obsession lies, so he turned into a ghost general and destroyed this place directly. , don't stay here." Xu Shi and Xu Yuan responded, and they immediately destroyed the building.

Zhao Hai has also seen it. There is indeed nothing useful in this building. Just destroy it. After destroying all these things, Zhao Hai led Xu Shi and Xu Yuan to the cave. When he got into the cave, he discovered that Lin Cang and the others had almost cleaned up all the ghosts in the valley. Although there were many ghosts, their strength was really not that good, so Lin Cang and the others had also cleaned up very well. Very fast.

Lin Cang and the others were also preparing to enter the cave. As soon as they saw Zhao Hai and the others coming out, they immediately came up to greet them. Zhao Hai nodded and said in a deep voice: "Fight the entire valley and take out the extra Zhengyang Talisman." Some, use it once in the valley, and never let any ghosts escape. By the way, I killed the ghost general this time and got a Tiger Head Hammer. This Tiger Head Hammer is a physical weapon, and I happened to have it. I don't have any weapons, so I stayed here. I don't want the sect reward for this battle." After saying that, Zhao Hai took out the tiger hammer and showed it to everyone.

Lin Cang and the others took a look at the Tiger Head Hammer. One look at the shape of the Tiger Head Hammer and they knew that it was definitely a physical weapon. Lin Cang immediately said: "What did the Alliance Leader say? This magical weapon is just right for you." Alliance Leader, Alliance Leader, just accept it. The benefits this time will naturally come from the Alliance Leader. Without the Alliance Leader, we would not have been able to complete this mission so smoothly."

Zhao Hai looked at Lin Cang and the others, smiled slightly, and said in a deep voice: "Okay, so I won't be polite to you. If you find any loot here, just share it equally. You don't have to give it to me, right? Okay, everyone must pay attention to the surrounding mountain walls to avoid any dark holes left by the enemy."

Everyone responded in agreement, and immediately began to act. One by one, the righteousness charms were thrown out. If there were ghosts wherever those righteousness charms passed, they would appear immediately. However, the ghosts here are spiritual and intelligent. They are not very tall, and they will not hide themselves at all, so there are indeed no other ghosts in the entire valley.

However, there are other gains in this valley. Someone discovered a dark cave in the valley. In that dark cave, there were some herbs called resurrecting grass. Of course, this kind of reviving grass cannot truly resurrect the soul. It has little effect, but it is a good medicine for treating mental damage. After being used as medicine, the effect is very good.

The income from these Resurrection Grasses is definitely not small. Zhao Hai also followed what he said and did not ask for these Resurrection Grasses. Instead, he gave the Resurrection Grasses to other people so that they could make more profits. No one refused. He immediately picked all the resurrecting plants, leaving only some immature ones, and then sealed the dark hole before leaving the valley.

When they left the valley and arrived outside the valley, they saw Bao Yiqing waiting for them outside. Zhao Hai and the others fell in front of Bao Yiqing. Zhao Hai smiled at Bao Yiqing and said, "Brother Bao is worried. The matter here has been settled, please donâ€™t worry, Senior Brother Bao."

When Bao Yiqing heard what Zhao Hai said, he couldn't help but feel happy. He quickly saluted Zhao Hai and said, "Thank you, Senior Brother Zhao. Thank you all Senior Brothers. I will issue you with the certificate of commission for completing the mission. Please take it back with you." While talking, Bao Yiqing took out a jade slip and gave it to Zhao Hai.

Zhao Hai took the jade slip and gave it to Xu Yuan, and then said to Xu Yuan: "Brother Xu, you go to Fangshi with us first, and then we go to No. 57. You return to the sect and complete the task." Submit it and then come find us, okay?" Task No. 271 was taken by Xu Yuan, so Xu Yuan must submit it, and they are going to Fangshi now. From Fangshi, While going to Fangshi near Mission No. 57, Xu Yuan had to go back and hand in the mission. After he finished handing in the mission, he could just go to the location of Mission No. 57 to find them.

Xu Yuan responded and immediately took the jade slip. Then Zhao Hai saluted Bao Yiqing and said, "Senior Brother Bao, we not only took on one task this time, we also took on another task. The matter is urgent now. We must leave immediately, please forgive me."

Bao Yiqing obviously didn't expect that Zhao Hai and the others would take on several tasks at the same time, but he immediately said: "In this case, I won't stay with you anymore, everyone, please." Zhao Hai nodded at him, and then they were covered with white light. In a flash, the next moment they had disappeared.

Bao Yiqing waited until Zhao Hai and the others disappeared, then turned to the direction of the camp and said loudly: "Okay, the valley has been cleaned up. Everyone will enter the valley immediately to see the situation." In the direction of the camp. Immediately, there were sounds of horns, and then countless soldiers walked out of the camp and entered the valley in formation.

There was indeed no ghost in the valley. Even the walls of the ghost town had collapsed. Of course they also saw the cave in the valley. The situation in that cave really surprised them. Although all the buildings in the valley They were all destroyed, but they could still see that there was a large area of â€‹â€‹buildings in the cave.

When Bao Yiqing put together the broken plaque of the General's Mansion, he already understood what was going on. He couldn't help but sigh. There was really nothing he could do about this matter. After all, it was over. It has been a hundred years, and the general and king of Qingsong Kingdom who ordered the killing back then is already dead, and no one will pursue this matter now.

At this time, Zhao Hai and the others had already appeared in Fang City. Xu Yuan hugged Zhao Hai and the others, and then returned directly to the sect to hand in the mission. However, Zhao Hai and the others went directly to mission location No. 57. I replenished some Zhengyang Talismans at the nearby Fangshi, and then rushed directly to the mission location.

Here in Wanshan Realm, if the upper court of the sect can receive a task, it must be something that the lower court cannot handle and is sent to the upper court. Therefore, when the upper court sends disciples to complete the task, there must be someone from the lower court on the side. Watch and confirm that the task is completed, and then the disciples of the lower courtyard will give a receipt, and let the disciples of the upper courtyard take it back to the sect. Only then will the task be canceled. It does not mean that you said the task was completed. Just completing the task, that's not going to work.
