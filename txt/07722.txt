c7722 meeting

In the main hall of the Blood Killing Sect, Zhao Hai sat there with a calm face. Wen Wenhai and the others were sitting below, and Pu Shitian was also sitting below. He was sitting not far from Wen Wenhai. Zhao Hai looked at everyone He glanced at it, then smiled slightly and said: "Okay, everyone is here. Today is the day when all the people from the world of Emperor Shitian and others join our Blood Killing Sect. I am very happy. In our big family of Blood Killing Sect, New members have been added. .”

Everyone smiled slightly, and then applauded enthusiastically. Emperor Shitian and the others all stood up, saluted everyone, and then sat down. Zhao Hai also looked at everyone and said: "We I think everyone knows about the situation of the Blood Killing Sect. What our Blood Killing Sect wants is not just to conquer. What we conquer are those who only want to go against the Blood Killing Sect. What our Blood Killing Sect wants is actually It is a fusion, a fusion of the power of all cultivation worlds, because the last enemy we face is the power of the laws of the Shadow Clan."

Having said this, Zhao Hai paused for a moment, and then continued: "Our Blood Killing Sect has always had a very broad mind. No matter what race you were from before, no matter what belief you used to have, you can We can accept you all if you join the Blood Killing Sect. As long as you really regard the Blood Killing Sect as your sect and as long as you abide by the rules of the Blood Killing Sect, then you are a disciple of the Suicide Sect and you are our Blood Killing Sect. The sect’s own people.”

No one spoke, but they all understood the meaning of Zhao Hai's words. Zhao Hai knew very well that no matter you were from the Sea Clan, the Heavenly Realm, the Monster Clan, or anything else. No matter what race you belong to, it doesn’t matter whether you were a righteous monk, a Taoist monk, a Buddhist monk, or a Demonic monk, as long as you join the Blood Killing Sect, as long as you abide by the Blood Killing Sect’s rules in the future, as long as you regard yourself as If you are a member of the Blood Killing Sect, the Blood Killing Sect will also treat you as one of their own.

This can also be said in reverse, if you don’t regard yourself as a member of the Blood Killing Sect and don’t respect the Blood Killing Sect’s rules, then don’t blame the Blood Killing Sect for being rude to you. This is Zhao Hai the meaning of. And the meaning of these words is also very obvious, he is beating those people.

When Jiuling Lao and Di Shitian heard what Zhao Hai said, they were all frightened. They all understood that Zhao Hai was telling them that after they joined the Blood Killing Sect, they should be more honest and don't If they don't act recklessly, the sect's rules are ruthless, so their hearts are all tight.

Zhao Hai was not talking about this matter, but looked at the crowd and said: "This time in the Heavenly and Human Realm, we did not waste any strength, but after taking the Heavenly and Human Realm, we discovered that there is still a space The passage can lead to the next interface, which should be the main realm that Elder Gongsun mentioned before. For this situation, we are also mentally prepared, but I am not ready to send people directly to enter the main interface now. Go there, I plan to wait for a while, let us kill the blood sect, and repair the whole thing for a year here in the heaven and human world, and then think about attacking the main interface."

When everyone heard what Zhao Hai said, they were all stunned, and then everyone looked at Zhao Hai with some confusion. They didn't know what he meant. Zhao Hai glanced at them, and then said: "Enter the main room." We don’t know what will happen at the interface, so we must be prepared. Even if nothing happens, we still have to be prepared, because if nothing happens, Then we will merge the realms, truly refine the eight realms of Tianlong and merge them into our Xuanwu space. If that time really comes, then our Blood Killing Sect will definitely appear. We are in the Wanshan Realm, and when we arrive at the Wanshan Realm, we must be ready for battle, but don’t forget that we have many enemies in the Wanshan Realm.”

Everyone immediately understood what Zhao Hai meant, because no one could say what would happen in the main world, so Zhao Hai decided to make preparations and let the disciples of the Blood Killing Sect use this year to Make some adjustments, and at the same time, use this year to integrate the Blood Killing Sect, and finally go to the main realm.

If there is a year's rest for the battle that took place in the main world, the disciples of the Blood Killing Sect must be in the best condition. No matter what happens, they can handle it. If nothing happens, then naturally Needless to say, the merging of realms is about to take place. First, the eight realms of Tianlong must be completely refined together, and then merged into the Xuanwu space. By then, the Blood Killing Sect will definitely appear. It's in Wanshan Realm, and I don't know where it will appear in Wanshan Realm. If it really appears in other people's sects, then I'm afraid there will be a big war.

Regarding Zhao Hai's decision, Wen Wenhai and the others have no objections, nor do Jiuling Lao and Emperor Shitian. Jiuling Lao is a little better. He can already say that he is the current Blood Killing Sect. He understood it very well, but Emperor Shitian was different. He could be said to have no understanding of the Blood Killing Sect. In this case, he would naturally not object.

Zhao Hai looked at everyone and said in a deep voice: "This year is also the time I give you all. In this year, people from all clans of the Blood Killing Sect must understand each other carefully, so that we can fight each other carefully." The Killing Sect is truly integrated and becomes a whole. In the future, I don’t want to hear our disciples of the Blood Killing Sect say to each other, you are from the Hai Clan, how are you? You are from the Buddhist sect, how are you? How about this, everyone should remember that you are all members of the Blood Sect, and everyone is a disciple of the Blood Sect. No matter what race you are from, no matter what belief you have, you all have the same identity. Okay. , I’ll just say this and let it all go.”

Everyone responded, then stood up, saluted Zhao Hai, then turned and left. They all understood what Zhao Hai meant. Zhao Hai emphasized the issue of identity once, just to tell everyone that this year's rest Time is for them to understand each other and integrate with each other. From now on, all the disciples of the Blood Killing Sect will be the same, regardless of their status. If the situation still occurs after one year, I am afraid that Zhao Hai will have to do it. Deal with them.

Zhao Hai did not leave Wen Wenhai and the others to talk this time, because there was no need. Wen Wenhai and the others had been following him for such a long time, and they should have understood the meaning of Zhao Hai's words, so he did not need to say anything more, so Zhao Hai did not stay with Wen Wenhai or the others.

Another reason is that the Blood Killing Sect's cabinet has already been formed. Even if Zhao Hai does nothing, there will be no problems if the cabinet headed by Wen Wenhai manages the Blood Killing Sect. Therefore, Zhao Hai does not If you are anxious, just let Wen Wenhai and the others handle it, and Emperor Shaktian is now a member of the cabinet.

In fact, Wen Wenhai is also leading the cabinet members in a meeting now. They are in a conference room of the Blood Killing Sect. After everyone sat down, Wen Wenhai looked at everyone and said: "Today The sect leader didn’t say a lot, but the main meaning was actually one, which was integration.”

Having said this, he paused for a moment, and then said in a deep voice: "In the past two years, many new people have joined our Blood Killing Sect, including the Sea Clan and the Heavenly and Human World. They have all joined our Blood Killing Sect. This greatly increased the number of people in our Blood Killing Sect. At the same time, it also brought about a problem, that is, everyone is not very familiar with each other, and there is a sense of strangeness, even because of different races. Some conflicts will arise, which is absolutely not allowed in the Blood Killing Sect."

Having said this, he glanced at everyone, and then said: "This year is the time given to us by the sect master. As cabinet members, we must handle this matter well. This is the sect master's trust in us. , is also a test for us by the sect master. After all, our cabinet has not been established for a long time, so it is indeed a bit difficult to do this now."

Chang Jun then spoke: "The sect master still has very high expectations for our cabinet. Each member of our cabinet has great power. It can be said that we are now the actual managers of the Blood Killing Sect. In this case "Xiaozhong, if we can't handle this matter well, it will be a huge disappointment to the sect master."

Everyone nodded, and Chang Jun continued: "So our focus in the next year is integration, so that the Blood Killing Clan and various races can be completely integrated together, but how can we eliminate the barriers and truly change them?" It is difficult to become a true brother and friend, please tell me what you think."

Everyone was silent for a while, and rolled their eyes for a while before speaking: "I think there is nothing that can make people familiar with it faster than fighting. We can conduct training, and conduct confrontation training in a real illusion, so that everyone can become familiar with it faster. The people in the branches will conduct confrontation training, and each branch will have disciples of different races, so they will soon become familiar with each other, and we will eliminate the barriers between them."

When Bai Yan said this, Wen Wenhai's eyes couldn't help but light up, and then he nodded and said: "Yes, this is a good method, because this will not only eliminate the barriers between disciples, but also attract new members to join us. It can be said that the disciples of the Blood Killing Sect should familiarize themselves with the fighting methods of our Blood Killing Sect as soon as possible. It can be said that it kills two birds with one stone. In addition, it can also cultivate a sense of competition among the disciples of each branch. However, this degree must be controlled well and cannot be allowed to happen. If those disciples really start fighting, then we will be considered a failure, and if not, new conflicts will arise."

Everyone nodded and understood what he meant. Confrontation training in each branch will create a sense of competition among the disciples of each branch. However, if it is not controlled well, people from the two branches will end up dead. Qiu, that would be troublesome. If one of them is not handled well, new conflicts will arise. If conflicts arise between those branches, it will only become more troublesome and destroy the true unity among the disciples of the Blood Killing Sect. This Zhao Hai will never allow it.
