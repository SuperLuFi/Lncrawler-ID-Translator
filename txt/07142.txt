c7142 Marshal in the air

Just when those flying yakshas were about to enter the city on the island, they heard several loud roars coming from the city. The sound was very loud, like a tiger, but also a bit like a cow, and also I don’t know what it was, but those flying yakshas didn’t seem to hear it and still flew towards the city.

Soon they flew over the city wall. Once they flew over the city wall, Zhao Hai and the others could clearly see the situation in the city. The city looked like a huge military camp. In the middle of the city, there was a very tall military camp. The palace is very tall and beautiful in style, but it is all black. Next to this palace, there are not many palaces. There are only military camps. The camps in these military camps are all made of stone. The stones that were built were all black, which looked dark and very strange.

At the same time, Zhao Hai also noticed that there were several very huge military camps near the city wall. In those military camps, there were many cow-like monsters. The reason why he was said to be a cow-like monster was because of this This monster has eight legs, but the body of a cow, and the head of a cow, but on his head, there are three horns, like a fork. The horns on both sides are long and curved upward, and the middle one is long. The horns are straight, but all eight of his legs are covered with green flames. They look very strange. I don’t know what these cows are for, but what is certain is that the ones that looked like tigers and cows before The same sound is made by these strange cows.

The yakshas carrying the iron balls flew directly to the main hall in the city. There was a square in front of the main hall. This square was also paved with blue stones. It was very big and looked like a martial arts arena. Those yakshas were like It landed on the square, near the main hall.

Only now did Zhao Hai and the others see clearly that the hall had nine floors, was square in shape, and was made of black stones. The top of the hall was covered with black tiles, and there were cornices at the four corners. On each cornice, there was a The black bell, the bell, was swaying gently with the breeze, making a crisp and sweet sound.

Those yakshas, ​​with the iron balls turned into by the puppet disciples, came to the front of the hall. In front of the hall stood two rows of flying yakshas. Their armors were also black, but they seemed to be more gorgeous. Some of those Yakshas walked in front of the guards and stopped. Then the leading Yaksha said to the guards: "Team Gale, returning from a mission, came here to give orders to Commander Lingkong."

The guard nodded and shouted into the hall: "Team Gale, give orders to the commander-in-chief." His voice was loud, and passed into the hall from a distance, and there was still a faint echo in the hall. , but the flying yakshas of the Gale Team stood there calmly without making a sound.

After a while, a voice came from the main hall: "Xiang Feng Team is coming to the hall." As soon as the guard heard the voice, he turned to the people of the Feng Feng Team and said: "Go in." The people of the Feng Feng Team walked towards the guard. After a salute, he entered the main hall with the iron ball.

In front of the door of the main hall, there is a thin person standing. The reason why he is called a human is because he is a woman, a very beautiful woman. She is wearing a black palace dress and looks very beautiful. , very charming, and the movement of her eyes shakes people's minds.

The woman watched the people from the Gale Team arrive at the door, nodded slightly to a few people, and then said in a deep voice: "Come in with me." Her voice was not clear. On the contrary, it was a little hoarse, but it was very It is magnetic, a bit like a woman's voice, and people will be attracted to his voice as soon as they hear it.

The members of Team Gale didn't even look at this seductive woman, they just lowered their heads and followed her towards the main hall. There are many people in the main hall. These people stand on both sides of the main hall. There are five rows on the left and five rows on the right. If you look closely, you will find that these people are all Yakshas, ​​not real human beings. Everyone is wearing clothes. Armor, with weapons.

In the main hall, there is a platform that is not very high. There is a chair on the platform. This chair is carved from white stone. The whole chair is like a ghost face with very long fangs. It looks very ferocious, and the person is sitting in the mouth of this ghost face, looking as if he has been eaten by this ghost face.

The person who will be in the ghost-faced chair is also a Yaksha. This Yaksha is also very ugly. He has a big tiger head on his head with two sharp horns and long fangs. The most important thing is Yes, his skin is actually dark blue. To say that he has fangs on the surface is really not unfair to him.

He is also wearing a suit of armor. Although this suit of armor is also black, you can faintly see the tiger helmet, which makes him look very majestic and domineering. This suit of armor also looks very gorgeous. , and on his left hand side, there is a long knife. This long knife is very long. It looks about five feet. There is a tiger head on the handle, but the knife is very thin and looks very sharp. . On his right side, he looked at a large shield. This large shield was also about four feet high and two feet wide. It was square and had a ghost face carved on the shield surface.

As soon as the members of the Gale Team saw the person sitting on the main seat, they immediately knelt down and said in unison: "I've seen the commander." After saying that, they all kowtowed to the commander in the air, looking incomparable. of respect. The tiger-headed marshal sitting in the upper seat just nodded. Then he glanced at the ten iron balls floating next to the Gale Team and said in a deep voice: "I asked you to go to Death Cave City before. After checking the situation, you found these things?"

The leader of the Gale Team immediately said: "Yes, Commander, these are the things that fell from the dead hole in the sky. There are ten of them in total, and they were all brought back." The mission they received before was just to go They inspected the situation in Dead Cave City. Now that the situation has been discovered, they will naturally report back to Commander Lingkong.

Commander Lingkong nodded. He glanced at the ten iron balls and said in a deep voice, "What is this thing? Does anyone know it?" It seemed that Commander Lingkong didn't know these iron balls either. That's why he asked, but not only him, but no one else knew him either.

Marshal Lingkong saw that no one made a sound or said anything. He just waved his hand. Following his movements, an iron ball flew in front of him. The magical weapon of the Gale Team that was originally attached to the iron ball also It fell off automatically. It was obvious that it was all done by Commander Lingkong. From this point, it can be seen that Commander Lingkong is a master.

The volley commander looked at the iron ball for a long time before his eyes lit up and he said: "This seems to be an iron ball? How is it possible? How could this be the legendary iron ball?" At this point, he stood excitedly. After standing up, Zhao Hai and the others noticed that this handsome man in the void was actually very tall. He was already nearly two meters tall. Although he was still very thin, his frame was very big. , you can tell at a glance that it is definitely not easy to mess with.

And his voice also made the entire hall become noisy. The Yashas standing in the hall seemed to be alarmed. They were all looking at the iron balls on the earth with curious faces. Obviously, they They were very curious about those iron balls, but because they were in the main hall, they did not dare to be rude, so they all craned their necks to watch from a distance, but did not dare to step forward to take a closer look.

Zhao Hai and the others were surprised by what Commander Lingkong said. They seemed very surprised when they talked about the appearance of the iron ball, and they also used several legendary words. Could it be that they had never seen an iron ball before? Or have they never seen iron? Judging from their appearance, they must have never seen iron. So what are their weapons made of?

At this moment, I saw Commander Lingkong slap the iron ball hard, and the iron ball fell to the ground, making a hole in the ground, but Commander Lingkong didn't care at all. Instead of looking at the damaged ground, he looked at the iron fairway with gleaming eyes: "It's really an iron ball, it's really iron, hahahaha, it's really the legendary hard iron, great, really It’s great.”

As soon as he heard what he said, the people in the hall were in chaos again. Commander Lingkong came to his senses immediately. He scanned the hall with his eyes. The people in the hall immediately became quiet. Lingkong The commander then looked at the crowd and said, "Everyone takes turns to come forward and take a look, but no movement is allowed."

Everyone in the hall responded, and from his voice, one could clearly hear the joy. Then people in the hall immediately took turns to come forward to check the iron ball, and some even gently touched it with their hands. I touched the iron ball, but no one dared to exert force as if they were afraid of breaking it.

The performance of those Yashas made Zhao Hai and others who had been watching all this in the Blood Killing Sect Hall were stunned. Zhao Hai looked at the crowd with some confusion and said: "What are these guys doing? Look. They look like they have really never seen an iron ball, and now they regard this iron ball as a treasure?"

Zhao Hai was really a little puzzled. Judging from the behavior of those people, they seemed to have never seen the iron ball. How could he not be surprised? It would not be a shame if the majestic Yasha clan had never seen the iron ball. Got a portion? What the hell is going on?

Wen Wenhai looked at the situation in the hall and said in a deep voice: "Looking at their appearance, they have really never seen iron. Their weapons are all black, and their armors are all black, but no matter how they look, they don't look like iron. It is made of metal, so in my opinion, the armor and weapons on their bodies may be made of unknown materials, so they may have never really seen iron, but they may have heard of it. Exceed the iron, otherwise there would not be such a saying in the legend."

Everyone nodded, feeling that Wen Wenhai's words were very reasonable. If the other party had seen metal before, then when they saw the iron ball, they would never behave like this. It can be shown that they have indeed never seen iron or even metal before.
