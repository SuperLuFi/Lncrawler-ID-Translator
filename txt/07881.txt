c7881 Jusha Town

The shopkeepers of the four major shops all looked as if they were in a black pot. They were completely black. After discovering that all the people in the town had left, they sent people to search everywhere, but they could not find any clues. None, which makes them all feel very dizzy. The most important thing is that the people behind them are coming in the next few days. If those people see Linyuan Town like this, their lives will be ruined. , it will definitely not be easy.

After a while, the shopkeeper of Xuanjia Sect said: "Someone must have leaked the news, otherwise it would be impossible for those guys from the Gujian Gang to leave. They had no intention of leaving before, so why did they suddenly have to leave? , and we decided to leave immediately after we decided to deal with them, which is absolutely abnormal."

None of the other three shopkeepers spoke. Among them, the shopkeeper of Qingyang Sect glanced at the shopkeeper of Xuanjia Sect and snorted coldly: "I don't know who it is, but he wants to deal with the ancient sword." Gang, it’s because I was humiliated by the Gujian Gang before, but now it brings all of us together in misfortune.”

He was really very angry. The people from Xuanjia Sect were really responsible for what happened this time, because they had always been unconvinced. In their opinion, the Ancient Sword Gang was nothing but a small place. , they are just a small gang composed of some small casual cultivators. What qualifications do they have to challenge Xuanjia Sect, dare to negotiate terms with Xuanjia Sect, and dare to give him face? It is precisely because of this idea that the shopkeeper of Xuanjia Sect , and then they tried their best to promote this matter, but they did not expect that it would be such a result in the end.

The shopkeeper of the Xuanjia Sect looked at the shopkeeper of the Qingyang Sect and said coldly: "What? Do you regret it now? I remember when I made this proposal, no one seemed to object, right? What's the point of regretting it now? It's too late if you want to quit." The shopkeeper of Xuanjia Sect just couldn't stand the look of the shopkeeper of Qingyang Sect. When he first proposed this proposal, no one objected, but now it seems that things are not as good as It developed as they expected, but they started to blame him. He didn't accept this, so he just pushed back.

When the shopkeeper of Qingyang Sect heard what he said, his face couldn't help but become even more ugly. He snorted coldly and said: "We have no objection. It's because some people forced it. Now that things have become like this, I think Do some people need to give us an explanation?" Of course, the shopkeeper of Qingyang Sect had reason to be angry. He did not think about dealing with the Ancient Sword Gang at the beginning, because they were very concerned about the current practices of the Ancient Sword Gang. Satisfied, the ancient sword gang's medicinal material production has increased, and they can earn more spiritual stones. Although most of them have to be handed over, they can also keep some of them, and the part he keeps is much more than before. , he is already very satisfied.

It was precisely because the shopkeeper of the Xuanjia Sect came to convince him and told him that as long as they controlled the Gujian Gang, they could get more, so he listened to the other party's words. But now, the people of the Gujian Gang directly He ran away, and all their plans were ruined. The most important thing was that they would be unlucky, and they might even lose their current lucrative job. How could he not be angry?

The shopkeeper of Xuanjia Sect looked at him and snorted coldly: "What do you want me to explain? I didn't force you to do this in the first place. If you don't agree, you can quit. After all, it's not you who are greedy. The blame is It's not on my head." He would not take the blame, although the cause of this incident was indeed because of him.

When the shopkeeper of Qingyang Sect heard his rogue words, his face turned livid with anger, and his eyes seemed to burst into flames as he looked at the shopkeeper of Xuanjia Sect. Just when he was about to have an attack, the shopkeeper on the side remained silent. The shopkeeper of the Iron Arm Sect suddenly said: "What's the point of talking about this now? Things have reached this point. What we have to do is to solve this matter. Otherwise, who are we afraid of? You can’t even get through this.”

As soon as he said these words, the shopkeepers of Xuanjia Sect and Qingyang Sect stopped talking. As he said, now that things have reached this point, it is meaningless to talk about who is to blame for this matter. If one of them fails, I'm afraid none of them will survive.

The shopkeeper of Baishi Academy also said in a deep voice: "Yes, it doesn't make much sense to talk about this now. Let's think about how to solve this matter, and we must solve it as soon as possible. I think the best thing we can do now is The first thing to do is to find the people from the Gujian Gang. What do you think?"

The other three people all nodded, agreeing with what he said, and then he continued: "It's not surprising that we didn't find them in the woods. The woods are too big. If they want to leave, we can't find them for a while." It is normal to see them, but they cannot always live in the woods. According to my opinion, they most likely went to the nearby town. What we have to do now is to find that town. ,What do you think?"

No one objected. Indeed, the area of ​​​​the woods near Linyuan Town was too large. In addition, the woods were very dense. It was not easy for them to find Zhao Hai and the others in the woods. But Zhao Hai and the others cannot stay in the woods all the time. They have so many old people and children. They need daily necessities, so their most likely place to go is actually other nearby towns. They need to find the ancient sword first. The people who helped him were talking about something else. If they couldn't find the people from the Gujian Gang, they would definitely not get anything good when the people behind them came.

The shopkeeper of Baishi Academy saw that the other three people all agreed, and then he continued: "If you don't have any other opinions, then let's do it. Now there are three towns closest to us, and we will leave one person. Stationed here in Linyuan Town, the other three people will go to the other three towns to look for people from the Gujian Gang. Once they find out, they will immediately send a message back and we will talk about other things then."

No one from the other three people objected. The shopkeeper of Baishi Academy said: "I'm not polite. Just let me stay here in Linyuan Town. If anything happens, I will notify you three as soon as possible. The remaining The three towns below, which one you want to go to, just choose it yourself." The other three people looked at each other and had no objection. One of them chose a town, and then they didn't say anything and just stood up. Turned around and left.

Watching the three people leave, the shopkeeper of Baishi Academy couldn't help but smile bitterly. To be honest, the reason why he agreed to the proposal of the shopkeeper of Xuanjia Sect to deal with the Ancient Sword Gang together was because he was indeed greedy. The second reason is that he feels that there will be no mistakes in this matter. In his opinion, it is really too easy for them to deal with the Ancient Sword Gang. As long as the people in the sect take action, it is not easy to capture, but there is no Come to think of it, that's not the case at all.

They never expected that the people from the Gujian Gang would run away and disappear completely. This was completely beyond their expectation and left them a little confused as to what to do, because they knew very well that they just Those who want to control the Gu Jian Gang do not really want to kill all the people in the Gu Jian Gang. If all the people in the Gu Jian Gang are really dead, then who do they expect to collect medicine for them? Without the people from the Gujian Gang to collect medicine for us, there would naturally be no need for their store to exist, and then there would naturally be no need for them to exist.

Just like Zhao Hai said, in fact, those who are the shopkeepers here in Linyuan Town are all servants of various sects. That’s right, they are not even formal disciples, they are just servants. If they cannot To be the shopkeeper, they can only return to the sect and be ordinary servants. In that case, they can only be ordered around and even ordered around. How can they be the shopkeeper here? of ease.

It is precisely because of this that if they really panic after discovering that all the people from the Gujian Gang are gone, they are afraid of losing everything they have now. It is precisely because of this that they want to find the members of the Gujian Gang as soon as possible. People, only in this way, they may be able to recover everything, otherwise, they will really be doomed.

For the four current shopkeepers, every moment is a torment. They really regret it immensely. They wish they could find the people from the Gujian Gang right away. They wish they could go back in time. They have never thought of it. This plan, this plan was never carried out.

But everything has happened, and it's too late for them to regret it. Now they can only find the people from the Gujian Gang. As for what to do after finding the people from the Gujian Gang, they really haven't thought of it. Now they I just hope that they can find the Ancient Sword Gang quickly, so that when the people from the sect come, they can have an explanation. Otherwise, when the people from the sect come, they will also go with the people from the Ancient Sword Gang. I don’t even know where it is, which is unreasonable.

And this time, they have to take action themselves. They can't let the clerks in the store help them complete the task, because those clerks don't have communication circles on them. Even if they find the ancient sword The people who helped the Gang had no way to send the news back to Linyuan Town at the first time. Only with the communication array in their hands, after discovering the people of the Ancient Sword Gang, they could send the news to Linyuan Town as soon as possible. When the news comes back, they will think about what to do next.

The shopkeeper of Qingyang Sect chose a small town to the north of Linyuan Town. This town is called Jusha Town. This town is more than 1,500 miles away from Linyuan Town, but it is not too far away. , but the area is much larger than Linyuan Town. This town can go into the abyss to explore and hunt for treasures. This is their main business. They are not very concerned about collecting herbs. In fact, they are on the edge of the endless abyss. These small towns generally have treasure hunting as their main purpose, and collecting herbs is just their side business. There are very few towns like Linyuan Town whose main business is collecting herbs, and The shopkeeper of Qingyang Sect wanted to go to Jusha Town to find out if anyone from the Gujian Gang had come here, and the reason why he chose Jusha Town was because it was here in Jusha Town. , he has acquaintances.
