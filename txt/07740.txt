c7740 magic circle

Zhang Ke was very satisfied with Chu Yun's words, and he also understood what Chu Yun meant, so he bowed to Chu Yun and said, "Senior Brother Chu, you're welcome. Since you are the commander, I will naturally listen to you in everything. "After he finished speaking, he stopped talking. He felt that he was high-profile enough. Anyway, he had already said everything he needed to say, so there was nothing left to say.

Chu Yun nodded and said: "Okay, then I will tell you my plan. Our Blood Killing Sect has always focused on stability. No matter what kind of enemy we face, there is only one requirement, and that is stability. This It was the same thing once, so my meaning is very simple. We all act together, but two teams will become our scout teams. They will conduct reconnaissance around us. After discovering the enemy, they will report back immediately, and then the army will go over and attack directly. , we don’t have to worry about the enemy not coming, because if the enemy keeps avoiding fighting with us, they will be defeated and they will be punished, but we will not, so the enemy will definitely come to us. , or let us find you."

Everyone nodded, and Chu Yun continued: "But the enemy may build a small base for defense. Our number is only 10,000 more than the enemy. If they really create a magic circle, it will really It may offset the advantage in numbers, so everyone must be careful.”

Zhang Ke then said: "There is another situation, that is, the enemy may use traps to deal with us. The last time we faced the enemy, we used the trap array to deal with the enemy. We were on the side with fewer people at that time. , in order to win, we first set up a trap array, and then we went out to train and find the enemy. After finding the enemy, we fought with the enemy, led the enemy to the array, and then activated the array to trap the enemy, and then in Against the enemy, we are the ones who win in the end, so we must also be on guard against the enemy using this move against us."

When they heard what Zhang Ke said, Chu Yun and the others were all stunned. Then Chu Yun nodded and said: "Yes, it makes sense. We should indeed be careful. If the enemy really uses this method to deal with us, It would really be very dangerous, but don’t worry too much. There are two magic circles in our team that are pretty good. Although they can’t enter the Shenji Hall yet, their magic circle skills are also pretty good. We can ask them to open the detection circle, and if we find that the enemy has used the circle, it will not be too late for us to respond."

Everyone nodded. Zhang Ke did not say that there were magic circle masters in their team. Chu Yun said so and asked him to do it. When Chu Yun saw that no one was talking, he said loudly. : "Wu Ling, you and Zeng Jing take your team as scouts. Be careful. When you encounter the enemy, report it to us immediately. Don't fight the enemy. Go ahead."

Wu Ling and Zeng Jing responded in agreement and led their teams away directly. Chu Yun immediately said: "Okay, other teams, all gather now, let's take action." Everyone responded in response, and then He went back to assemble the team. Not long after, all the teams gathered together. Then, under Chu Yun's order, they all took off, and then flew straight to the north.

They don't know where the enemy is, but they can't stay here forever. There are actually rules for the sect to arrange such training. The two of them will not be too far away, and relatively speaking, the number of people is large. One side must be more proactive. The smaller side can build a base in place and wait for the larger side to attack. However, if the smaller side just runs away instead of fighting the larger side, That is absolutely not possible.

Everyone was not flying very fast. While flying over Chuyun, they said to the captains: "I have calculated that the sect is for training, so the distance between the enemy and us is generally not more than a thousand miles. Let's go to A thousand miles north, because that is the direction where enemies are most likely to appear. If there is no one in the north, we will turn to the west. Enemies will usually appear in these two directions, so there is no need to worry, we should be able to find them soon. Enemy.

As soon as he finished speaking, he heard Wu Ling report: "Senior Brother Chu, we have found the enemy. The enemy has really built a base, right here in the northwest. The distance from us is only about four hundred miles." They. These people are all monks, and they all fly. Because Wu Ling and the others are scouts, they don't need to slow down, so they have flown far away.

Chu Yun and several other captains heard Wu Ling's voice, and everyone's spirits were shocked. Chu Yun immediately said: "Send the coordinates, and we will rush there immediately." Wu Ling responded, Then a coordinate was directly sent over. After Chu Yun read the coordinate, he directly adjusted his direction and flew straight in the direction of the enemy.

After a while they met Wu Ling, and at the same time they also saw the enemy. The enemy was on the top of a hill and established a base there. The base looked very simple. The enemies were also from one team in the east and one team in the west. Standing there, they could not see the magic circle on the mountain, but they were sure that the enemy must have established a base there, because even if they were not very good at magic circle, they could see that the enemy's The positions of the squads are very particular, that is to say, the positions where the enemy squads stand, and the others are all positions.

As soon as he saw this situation, Chu Yun immediately said loudly: "Nangong, Xiao Tang, you two come here and see what these guys are doing and what magic formation they are using." Then his voice immediately Two people walked up to him and carefully looked at the enemies on the hill below.

The enemies obviously saw them, but they stood there motionless, as if there was nothing special about them. However, Chu Yun and the others could clearly feel that the enemies were ready and waiting. Let them attack.

Zhang Ke glanced at the top of the hill at this time, and then said in a deep voice: "Jiu Yan, come here." Jiu Yan responded, walked out of the crowd, and came to Zhang Ke's side. He looked He glanced at Zhang Ke and then said in a deep voice: "Captain, are you looking for me?"

Zhang Ke nodded, then pointed to the top of the hill below and said, "Look carefully at the top of the hill to see what kind of array the enemy has set up. Can you tell?" Zhang Ke is actually very concerned about Jiu Yan. He is confident. In his opinion, Jiuyan's magic circle ability can definitely be called a magic circle master. However, the Blood Killing Sect did not let him enter the Shenji Hall. This is really weird, so He always believed that Jiu Yan was a talent that had been buried.

In fact, Zhang Ke didn't know that Jiuyan's magic circle ability was very strong, but compared with the people at Shenji Hall, it was far behind. The people at Shenji Hall were stronger than each other. In the past, When not all the disciples of the Blood Killing Sect learned the magic circle, the Shenji Hall might still have people with Jiuyan's strength, but since all the disciples of the Blood Killing Sect can learn the magic circle, the Blood Killing Sect's The overall level of the magic circle has been improved, and the standards for recruiting people at Shenji Hall have also been improved. People like Jiuyan are not qualified.

Jiu Yan is very thoughtful. He is still working hard. He believes that one day he will be able to join the Shenji Hall, so he has always been very obsessed with the magic circle. Now he took a closer look at the magic circle. , then his face couldn't help but become a little solemn, and then said in a deep voice: "Captain, the array they arranged is actually very simple, it is just a Bagua array, but their Bagua array is very special, because their Bagua array is made by passing We have improved a Bagua array, which can change from positive to negative, or from negative to positive. There are too many changes in a magic circle like this, and it is really difficult to deal with them. If you really want to deal with them, If so, I think the best way is to first find a small team to conduct a tentative attack on this magic circle. This team must be strong and see how powerful this magic circle is. Then we can make a judgment. There may still be hope of breaking the formation."

Zhang Ke nodded, and then he said in a deep voice: "If our team attacks, where do you think we should attack from?" Zhang Ke knew very well that he had already said what he said before. If we really encounter a hard battle, Chu Yun would probably send them to fight, so he had to be confident.

As soon as Jiuyan heard what Zhang Ke said, he understood what Zhang Ke meant. His face became more solemn, and then he moved his hand, and a compass appeared in his hand. Then he looked at the compass, and at the same time, his optical brain He was also making quick calculations. After a while, Jiu Yan raised his head and said to Zhang Ke: "If we attack, I will attack from the southeast and then to the southwest, because I feel that one of these two places is possible. It’s the Shengmen, other places should be very dangerous.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Zhang Ke waved his hand and said: "Senior Brother Chu called me, Gu Yi, form your team and be prepared. We may be the first to attack. Then we will do what Jiu Yan said , fighting in from the southeast, and then fighting out to the southwest, I really want to see if those guys are really that powerful."

After Zhang Ke moved, he came directly to Chu Yun's side, hugged Chu Yun's fist and said: "Senior Brother Chu, you call me." He just received Chu Yun's notification, so he came to Chu Yun's Around him, he believed that Chu Yun must have asked him to attack the enemy this time.

Chu Yun looked at Zhang Ke and said in a deep voice: "Junior Brother Zhang, the base that the enemy has set up now should be a magic circle, but this magic circle is very complicated. If we want to understand the situation of this magic circle, we must first understand the situation of this magic circle. This formation conducts a tentative attack to see what changes have occurred in the enemy's formation. However, this attack will be very dangerous, but it must be done, and a stronger one must be sent. I want your team to attack, otherwise it may not have much effect, so I want your team to give it a try, what do you think?" Chu Yun also knows that no matter who is given a task like this, it will It was very difficult, and even meant to make people die, so he spoke to Zhang Ke in this tone.
