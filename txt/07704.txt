c7704 fight

People in the Blood Killing Sect have long known that all the monks here in the Heavenly and Human Realm are actually demons, because there is no one here at all, and the reason why these human-monsters can develop is because of the Emperor. Shitian, he was originally the guardian beast of the Jade Buddha Temple. He was finally placed here and became the guardian beast of the heaven and human world. But here, he was influenced by the power of Buddha and practiced for a long time, so Turning him into a demon, he could turn into a human form, and his thinking became more and more like a person because of the influence of Buddhism.

It is precisely because of this that he also started to establish a sect here, and slowly established the power here in the heaven and human world, turning many demon clans into demon clans, and these demon clans slowly became The monks in all the temples here in the heaven and human world, so those monks, in essence, are actually demons.

However, they are different from the ordinary demon clan. Even if the ordinary demon clan becomes powerful and can turn into human form, the wild nature in them will not disappear. Because they are demon clan, they have not studied Buddhism, so they Their thinking will still stay at the level of monsters. Only some great monsters who have been here for many years can think like humans.

But these monsters in the human world are different from him. They have been influenced by Buddhism from the very beginning, so their way of thinking is very different from that of ordinary monsters. Thinking is more like a person, even more like a monk.

But thinking like a monk does not mean that they are really an enlightened monk. They are still far away. Moreover, the inheritance of the demon clan is actually very different from that of the human race. The inheritance of the demon clan , it’s more in the body and in the blood.

If nothing happens, after a few hundred years, this monster clan may become a real eminent monk. Buddhism will remove the hostility from their bodies and the animal nature in their blood, and they will become real eminent monks. , it is not impossible, but it takes time.

But it's different now. Before the beastly nature of these monsters had been transformed, people from the Blood Killing Sect came to attack, and they attacked in this way. Adding Hu An's words, This slowly awakened the animal nature in those monks. They felt that their bodies were getting hotter and hotter, their heartbeats were getting faster and faster, and at the same time, they also had a bloodthirsty impulse.

Hu'an also felt the changes in those monks, but at this stage, he could no longer control those monks, because the war was about to begin, and the Blood Killing Sect's army was about to appear in front of them. At this moment At that time, he was trying to help those monks, which would only allow the Blood Killers to kill them easily, so he did not think about stopping them, but prepared to attack with all his strength.

When he saw the blood-killing sect's army rushing towards them in neat formation, Hu An shouted: "Attack, attack with all your strength, kill." After saying this, he waved his tiger With the Zen staff in their heads, they rushed towards the blood-killing sect's army, and the other monks did the same. They all waved their weapons and rushed towards the blood-killing sect's army.

At this time, a person suddenly rushed out from the Blood Killing Sect's army. This person quickly rushed to Hu An, glanced at Hu An, and said in a deep voice: "Your opponent is me, come on, Let me meet you and see how strong you are." This man was holding a long-handled sledgehammer. This weapon was also a heavy weapon. It was very similar to the tiger head Zen staff in Hu An's hand. Coupled with his tall and strong figure, he also looks domineering.

This person’s name is Xu Gang. He has been following Zhao Hai for a long time. He was originally a rogue cultivator and a thief among the rogue cultivators. When Zhao Hai left the Tianxue Sect to go out for a trial, he subdued him. , Since then, he has been following Zhao Hai. For a long time before, he had been commanding the cavalry team of the Blood Killing Sect. It can be said that he was also the real power figure of the Blood Killing Sect.

But later he became obsessed with training. In his opinion, improving his own strength was the most important thing. There were many people leading the cavalry, but not many people could really help Zhao Hai, so he started After practicing hard, he also mentioned this matter to Zhao Hai. Zhao Hai did not object and just let him practice. He used to be just an ordinary core elder and was not very valued by others, but This time when the cabinet was formed, he was a replacement cabinet member. From this point of view, it can be seen that Zhao Hai actually valued him very much.

However, Xu Gang doesn't like to interfere with the affairs of the cabinet. He still likes to practice. Now his strength is definitely ranked among the top in the Blood Killing Sect. Although he is not as good as Ding Chunming, he is generally People will definitely not be his opponents. It is precisely because of this that he became a substitute member of the cabinet. Although it is a bit surprising, there are not many people who object.

This time, Xu Gang and others also came to sit in each team, because they also knew that there are actually many masters in the world of heaven and humanity. To face these masters, they must come forward, and Xu Gang Today we faced Hu An. Their weapons were very similar, both were heavy weapons with long handles.

When Hu An saw Xu Gang, his eyes lit up. Then he laughed loudly and said, "Okay, let me see how strong the masters of the Blood Killing Sect are." After saying that, he moved and walked straight towards Xu Gang rushed over, swung the tiger-head Zen staff in his hand, and smashed it towards Xu Gang.

Xu Gang also laughed loudly, and Yi Wu came forward with the sledgehammer in his hand. The two of them started fighting with their sticks, because both of them used heavy weapons, and those who used heavy weapons would They were very confident in their own strength, so the Zen staffs and sledge hammers of the two people would hit each other from time to time, making a loud sound, and the place where the two people were fighting would automatically be moved out of the way by others. However, those people had no way to get close to the place where the two were fighting, for fear of being accidentally injured by the two.

At this time, the monks in the Heaven and Human Realm were also fighting with the disciples of the Blood Killing Sect. The contact between the two sides caused the monks to suffer a big loss. The disciples of the Blood Killing Sect were really using battle formations. They were so skilled. When they faced the monks, they first attacked with flying swords. Countless flying swords attacked those monks. Before the monks could fully react, there were already many monks. The sword turned into a white light and disappeared.

Those monks who turned into white light found the next moment that they had exited the real illusion and returned to their own meditation room. This made them understand that if they were in a real battle, they would be dead now. It is precisely because After making such a discovery, they finally breathed a sigh of relief. Anyway, it was good that they were not dead.

However, they still wanted to see if they could enter the real illusion, so they took out the magic circle once and input energy into the magic circle. The next moment they found that they had come to a large In the room, they were standing in the middle of the room. In front of them, there was a large projection showing some options, such as watching games, training, studying, etc. They took a look at those options and then thought about it. As soon as they thought about it, they already understood what those choices were for, and they immediately chose to watch the battle.

After they chose to watch the battle, the next moment they discovered that they seemed to be above the battlefield. Below was the battlefield where the Blood Killing Sect and the monks from the Heavenly Realm were fighting. Come and watch the two sides, and the fight was extremely lively. , and when they wanted to go down, it was impossible.

But then they discovered that there seemed to be a lot of things they could do while watching. For example, they could select two people who were fighting and just watch the two of them fighting. For example, they could make the battlefield smaller, and then They were all very excited to see what was happening on the entire battlefield and so on.

Some disciples prefer to watch single-player battles. There are even many people who just want to watch the battle between Hu An and Xu Gang. They can also just watch the battle between these two people. However, some disciples want to watch the battle between them. If they want to see what the Blood Killing Sect's battle formation looks like, they can also watch the battle formation alone.

Soon, more and more people joined in watching the battle. Among them were those from the Heaven and Human Realm, and also the disciples of the Blood Killing Sect. The Blood Killing Sect issued an order this time, because the Heaven and Human Realm The people have already agreed to join the Blood Killing Sect, so the Blood Killing Sect does not need to deal with them with all their strength. Therefore, as long as a disciple of the Blood Killing Sect dies, they must withdraw from the battle and can only watch the battle. Unlike In the past, they could fight after being resurrected.

This war did not last very long. After all, the number of monks in Sifang Huzun Temple was far behind that of the Blood Killing Sect, and they did not know how to fight, so they simply It was impossible for them to be the opponents of the Blood Killing Sect, so they were quickly defeated. Apart from the four abbots, there was no one alive in the Sifang Huzun Temple, and even for the four abbots, the situation was not the same at this time. Not very good. Although their strength is not weak, it is still far behind Xu Gang and others. Xu Gang and others have already gone to the time acceleration area to retreat. Their strength is very strong. Naturally. It is much stronger than Hu An and the others.

When all four of Hu An and the others were killed, today's war was over. However, even in the real illusion, the disciples of the Blood Killing Sect still moved forward step by step according to their plan. Everywhere, everyone has established their own magic circle.

However, what surprised the disciples of the Blood Killing Sect was that none of the monks from the Heavenly and Human Realm had transformed into the demon beast in the end. You must know that all demon clans have one characteristic. That is the form in which they have the strongest fighting power, the form in which they become their true bodies. It is precisely because of this that everyone in the Blood Killing Sect thought that at the end of the battle, those monsters in the heaven and human world would also turn into them. They were ready to fight them in their original form, but what surprised them was that until the end, those people did not turn into their original form, which made them very puzzled.
