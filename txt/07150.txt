But the situation of the Blood Killing Sect is different. To be honest, if the Blood Killing Sect does not have Zhao Hai now, the Blood Killing Sect will basically be finished. But if Zhao Hai does not have the Blood Killing Sect, he can still live well. , even better than he is living now, because whether it is the undead clan or the alien clan, they are all loyal to Zhao Hai. They will never betray Zhao Hai, so the Blood Killing Sect does not need those powers at all. The checks and balances, the scheming and the emperor's tricks, in the face of Zhao Hai's absolute strength, these things are just children's play. .

It is precisely because of this that Zhao Hai said these words to Wen Wenhai and the others today. In fact, Zhao Hai also said these words before, but Wen Wenhai and the others were still a little worried and did not do what Zhao Hai said. Now Zhao Hai Hai said these words again, and these words really stunned Wen Wenhai and the others.

After a while, Wen Wenhai finally said: "Boss, we understand, but there are some things that if you don't make the decision, we always feel unsure. Although our Blood Killing Sect is powerful, the top The strength is not very strong yet. If something goes wrong and our Blood Killing Sect suffers too much loss, it will not be a good thing for our Blood Killing Sect." Everyone else also clicked. He nodded and agreed with Wen Wenhai's words.

Zhao Hai looked at their expressions and said with a smile: "Don't worry, as long as I'm here to take charge, nothing will happen to our Blood Killing Sect. And don't forget, now we are just waiting for someone else to do it." It’s just inside a large magic weapon. This is just an inner space created by others. The purpose is to test the disciples. Therefore, with our strength, we can deal with the people here. There is nothing to worry about. Go with confidence and boldness. Just do it, I believe in you.”

Upon hearing what Zhao Hai said, Wen Wenhai and the others all responded. Zhao Hai waved his hands and said, "You guys can discuss the next actions. I don't want to get involved too much, so go ahead." Wen Wenhai responded. , and immediately discussed their next actions with the others, but Zhao Hai disappeared in a flash.

As soon as he saw Zhao Hai leaving, Wen Wenhai couldn't help but sigh, smiled bitterly and said: "Everyone, it seems that the boss really doesn't want to care about these things anymore. Next, we have to rely on ourselves. Let's talk about it, everyone. What should we do next?" Wen Wenhai is also really impatient. Other sects, sect leaders and elders are unable to firmly grasp the power in their hands, but Zhao Hai is good at it and just gives it to him. These powers were thrown out, and they couldn't even think about taking them back. How could he not be distressed?

Chang Jun smiled slightly, and then said: "It doesn't matter if the sect leader doesn't want to take care of these things. We can just take care of them. As long as the sect is strong enough, then our Blood Killing Sect will be safer. If it's because of these demands, If something happened and disturbed the sect leader, that would be bad, okay, let’s talk about what happened this time.”

No one objected, and they rolled their eyes and said, "We destroyed the Yaksha here in Death Cave City, and drove away the Feitian Yaksha in Lingkong City, and achieved a great victory, but that was already more than half a month ago. Now there are flying yakshas appearing outside our Blood Killing Sect's base, spying on our base, which shows that those yakshas have reacted and are ready to take action." Bai Yan is still an elder, but now he has You are a branch-level elder, and you are in charge of military training. The so-called branch-level elder is actually just a title. It does not mean that you must be the person in that branch. It is just a status indicator. Zheng has nothing to do with position, so Bai Yan can naturally come to attend the military meeting. Not only him, but also Chen Chu, Jiang Shenglin, and Tang Yingyi, they are all branch elders, and their status is not low.

However, there are only four of them who came out of the Black and White Battlefield, and they are branch-level elders. Among the remaining people, few have become ordinary elders. Most of them have disciples, and all of them are formal disciples. The disciples of the following levels, that is to say, they are basically all peripheral disciples, while the outer disciples are registered disciples, so the gap is not as big as usual.

But those who started to join the Blood Killing Sect from the Black and White Battlefield did not feel resentment towards Zhao Hai. On the contrary, their hearts were full of expectations. Although their status was very low, their treatment was Very good, and they still have several lives. The most important thing is that the skills they practice are the best, and they have no shortage of materials for practice. They believe in their talents and believe that one day they will definitely become Formal disciples, even core disciples.

These people already know the Blood Killing Sect very well, and it is precisely because they know the Blood Killing Sect very well that they will not hate Zhao Hai, let alone feel that they have become peripheral disciples of the Blood Killing Sect. On the contrary, they feel that they are very lucky to be the peripheral disciples of the Blood Killing Sect, because the Blood Killing Sect has given them such an opportunity to join the Blood Killing Sect, which is already very good. If you want more, you have to fight for it yourself. The Blood Killing Sect also gave them opportunities, so they will not hate anyone.

All people who have ascended from the lower realm know very well that if you see others who are better than you and only feel envious and jealous, then you will never become a master, let alone succeed in ascending. If you are strong, you must find out why he is strong. If he has any treasures, you must find a way to snatch them from his hands. If he has any special training methods, you must find a way to get them. If it really doesn't work, you have to find a way to make yourself stronger, find the practice method that suits you best, and make your practice faster. Only with this mentality can you become a strong person, not just If you look at powerful people and just drool at the side, or curse or say a few acid words, then you will never go far in the world of cultivation, and you may even become the first batch of people to be eliminated. , the world of cultivation is so cruel.

Moreover, those who joined the Blood Killing Sect from the beginning of the Black and White Battlefield now know the strength of the Blood Killing Sect. To be honest, the strength of the Blood Killing Sect surprised them. They knew very well that the Blood Killing Sect wanted to destroy them. It is really too easy to get rid of them. Under such circumstances, they dare to be dissatisfied.

As for Baiyan and the others, they have long given up the idea of ​​relying on the people who joined the Black and White Battlefield as their bargaining chips. They know very well that there is no way those people can become their bargaining chips. In the Blood Killing Sect, Here, if you want to live a better life and have a higher status, then you must do two things. First, you must practice hard to make yourself very powerful. Once your strength is achieved, Zhao Hai will naturally give you the corresponding status. Second, you must be capable. Even if your strength is not enough, but you perform well in other aspects, then you can get the corresponding status, just like Baiyan and their commanding abilities are just like the abilities of some Blood Killing Sect disciples in refining weapons, magic formations, etc. As long as you do particularly well in a certain aspect, you can get the corresponding status. This is the Blood Killing Sect. The basis of survival.

Byakugan's abilities have been fully revealed in the previous battles, so during this reorganization, he became the branch elder, with a very high status, although his strength is not very high. , but his ability is enough. Many Blood Killing Sect disciples know this, so no one has any objections.

Bai Yan's words also made everyone present nod. They were all experienced in many battles. Naturally, they knew very well that the enemy had been spying on the Blood Killing Sect's base. In fact, they were conducting reconnaissance. Now that they knew After the Blood Killing Sect's strength, they will definitely come to attack the Blood Killing Sect.

Although I don’t know whether the branches of power here in the Yaksha Realm are a whole or fighting separately, one thing is certain, that is, Zhao Hai and the others are definitely outsiders, and the identity of this outsider, when they get here, It will become the public enemy of all Yashas, ​​so they don't have to think about what to do. Others will not care about such a good thing. This kind of thing basically won't happen here.

And don’t forget, this is the inner space refined by others to test the disciples. People who come in from the outside will be naturally hostile, so those Yaksha will not let them go, so here Don't think about defeating them all or living in peace. Even if those Yashas want to live in peace with the Blood Killing Sect, the Blood Killing Sect people will not agree. They are here to conquer.

Zhu Yong said at this time: "Judging from the movement speed of those Yakshas, ​​they are really very fast. Now our alien Yaksha clan is also very fast. Compared with those Yakshas, ​​I am afraid they are slightly slower." Not to mention the other Yakshas, ​​and they are obviously veterans and have experienced hundreds of battles. Everyone may not have noticed that when they fly in the sky, they will never stop in one place and float there. They will not keep flying along the same track, but will suddenly turn around. This is done so that our energy weapons cannot pinpoint them. This is something that only veterans who have been on the battlefield and have gone through countless battles can do it. , so these Yaksha are definitely more terrifying than any enemies we have ever encountered."

Everyone nodded. In the Blood Killing Sect, Zhu Yong is absolutely the authority in terms of reconnaissance and intelligence, so everyone in the Blood Killing Sect attaches great importance to his opinions. What Zhu Yong said represents those true Yasha people. It was very difficult to deal with them, and Wen Wenhai and the others had solemn expressions on their faces.

Wen Wenhai glanced at everyone, and then said: "It seems that this level is really difficult. When we were in the snake world, we wanted to preserve some strength, but in the end we suffered a loss. We almost missed it several times. Failed, we must not make that mistake again this time, so we must be more careful. Everyone has seen Lingkong Island before. This kind of island that can fly in the sky is actually very scary. Although they The flight of the island relies on cattle to pull it, but once this kind of island moves, the huge inertia will not be easy to block, so in the future, you must be careful when facing the Blood Killing Battle Fort."
