c7841 Return

In the blink of an eye, more than twenty days have passed. Hu Zhi and his herb collection team have left the town for nearly a month, but they still have not come back. Zhao Hai is not too worried. He is with Hu Zhi and his team. There were some marks left on their bodies. If something happened to Hu Zhi and the others, he would definitely feel it, but Aunt Liu and the others didn't know, so they were still very worried, but they didn't show it.

Zhao Hai didn't say anything about their reaction. Their behavior was very normal. However, Zhao Hai didn't say that Hu Zhi and the others should be back soon, because he had already felt that his marks were leaving. They are getting closer here, and it seems that they will be back before long.

During this month, Zhao Hai and the others were not idle. They made a lot of wooden barrels and pickled a lot of vegetables. Now they have dozens of barrels of pickled vegetables. Even if they only eat pickled vegetables now, they You can eat it for a while. After all, pickles are very salty and no one can eat much of them.

The people in the town are now used to the deserted town, but people like Lao Liutou and others behave very normally, but the people in the big stores, on the other hand, can't sit still anymore. Zhao Hai has discovered that some clerks from big stores are asking for information from Old Liu Tou and the others.

Zhao Hai was not prepared to block the news. There was no need to do so. Anyway, those people would know it sooner or later. If they knew it now, they would know it. It was no big deal, so Zhao Hai did not stop those people from the big stores from going. Ask for information, because he is also very busy recently.

Zhao Hai is either busy with other things or with things in the fields. In the past month, some seeds in the fields have all grown out. The seedlings are growing well, but some are a bit annoying, and that is those weeds. It also grew like crazy. Zhao Hai had no choice. In the afternoons of the past few days, he didn't even go to the woods. He took the children and the rest of the people to weed the fields every day. Finally, he saw some results. The grass was They've almost done it.

Finally, on the twenty-sixth day of their defense, Hu Zhi and the others returned to the town. When their group entered the town in great force, the people in the big shops in the town, Everyone breathed a sigh of relief, and Zhao Hai also took the people who stayed behind to meet them.

Hu Zhi looked at Zhao Hai who was leading the people to meet them, with a smile on his face. He walked quickly to Zhao Hai, laughed at Zhao Hai and said: "Hahaha, brother, we haven't seen each other for nearly a month. , are you okay?" Hu Zhi had always had a good impression of Zhao Hai, so he said this.

Zhao Hai glanced at everyone and saw that everyone had a look of dust on their faces. He also smiled and said: "Everything is fine with us and everything is fine at home. Brother, you have worked hard. Come quickly, I have prepared something for everyone." Now that the food is ready, let’s go eat something and have a good rest. Let’s talk about anything tomorrow.”

When Hu Zhi heard what Zhao Hai said, he couldn't help laughing and said: "Okay, then let's go and have a good meal. Let's go and eat." Everyone responded with a roar, although there were signs on their faces. Some looked tired, but it could be seen that they were very happy. Looking at this situation, Zhao Hai knew without asking that the harvest this time must be quite big.

When everyone arrived at the canteen, Aunt Liu and the others immediately put out food, which was just some stuff made from Polygonatum japonica and some side dishes. There wasn't even much meat, but everyone still ate very sweet food. After so many days, They had never had a few bites of hot food while outside, but now they finally had hot meals and dishes. Of course they were very happy.

Hu Zhi also ate two large bowls of Huang Jing stewed meat, but there was not a lot of meat, but the food he ate was still very delicious. After he finished eating, he took a deep breath and said to Zhao Hai: "Finally, it's hot. Yes, it’s not easy. Brother, if anything happens, we’ll talk about it tomorrow. We’re really exhausted today and I’m going to take a nap.”

Naturally, Zhao Hai would not stop them and immediately let them go to rest. Hu Zhi was not polite and led all the people who had eaten to have a rest. After the town had just become lively, it immediately Quietness returned, but when you stand on the streets of the town, you can seem to hear snoring one after another.

Hu Zhi and the others were really exhausted. They slept until noon the next day and then woke up. After waking up, they were in the mood to clean up their personal hygiene, take a shower, and eat. After eating the meals prepared by Aunt Liu for them, they were in the mood to do other things.

Hu Zhi didn't see Zhao Hai. When he asked Aunt Liu and the others, he found out that Zhao Hai had taken the children and the people who stayed in the town to the woods. There were still a lot of wild vegetables to pick in the woods, and They also found some other edible things, and they were going to pick some more.

When Hu Zhi and Aunt Liu came to the warehouse and saw the pickled vegetables, he was really shocked. He really didn't expect that Zhao Hai and the others had done so many things these days, so many pickled vegetables. Food, it seems that they don’t have to worry about running out of food in the future.

After dinner in the evening, Lanka and the others all fell asleep. Only then did Hu Zhi, Zhao Hai and the others have time to sit together and discuss what to do next. As soon as they sat down, Hu Zhi let out a sigh of relief, and then said to Zhao Haidao: "Brother, thanks to the dry food you prepared for us this time, if it weren't for the dry food, we would never have been able to support it for such a long time, but our gain this time is also great. Our gain this time , the gang can keep three hundred spirit stones, and the remaining spirit stones are enough for each family to share dozens of pieces, which is more than our previous income in a year, which we never expected. "

Zhao Hai said in a deep voice: "Brother, don't be too happy. Those big shops already know that we went out to collect herbs together. They must also have thought of it. Our harvest this time must be great. At this time, they fooled The price will be lowered, so the big brother will negotiate the price with those big stores tomorrow. There are also two companies, Ke Lai Xuan and Yun Lai Inn. I have heard about them before, and these two are not to be messed with. Although I We don’t know where they come from, but it’s better to maintain a good relationship between us and them, so we still have to share some of the animal meat with them.”

Hu Zhi nodded, but there was a strange look on his face. Before he discussed the matter with Zhao Hai, he already knew from Aunt Liu what Zhao Hai and the others had been doing recently. To be honest, he He really didn't expect that Zhao Hai had done so many things, which also made him completely trust Zhao Hai. It seemed that Zhao Hai really did it for their own good, otherwise it would not have been possible for him to do so many things for him.

When he thought of this, Hu Zhi turned to look at Zhao Hai, and then said: "Brother, I can't help you. In fact, there was something I didn't tell you last time. Don't blame me." Hu Zhi While saying this, he kept looking at Zhao Hai. He wanted to see Zhao Hai's reaction.

Zhao Hai was stunned for a moment, but then he waved his hand indifferently and said: "Brother, what are you talking about? If you don't tell me, there must be a reason. How can I blame you? If eldest brother thinks you can tell me, Then just say, if you think you can’t tell me, then you don’t have to tell me.”

Seeing Zhao Hai's reaction, Hu Zhi was even more moved. He looked at Zhao Hai and said: "Brother, I can't help you, but this matter is too important. I really don't dare to tell you, brother. But looking at what you have done recently, brother, I feel that it is very necessary for me to tell you this matter. Brother, we really cannot mess with those two families, Ke Lai Xuan and Yun Lai Inn, because they are in the same group with us. .”

When Zhao Hai heard what Hu Zhi said, he was stunned. He looked at Hu Zhi with some confusion and said in a deep voice: "Brother, what do you mean by this? Could it be that Ke Lai Xuan and Yun Lai Inn are our helpers?" Isn’t it possible to open it? It doesn’t look like it, brother, you usually have no contact with them, so it doesn’t look like we opened it.”

Hu Zhi shook his head, then sighed and said: "Of course they were not started by us. I mean, they are on the same side as us. Brother, now I no longer hide it from you. In fact, we used to These people in the Sword Sect, except for you, have all joined a casual cultivator organization called Hell Gate, and Ke Laixuan and Yunlai Inn are all properties of Hell Gate, so I say they He’s on the same side as us.”

Zhao Hai actually heard Hu Zhi say that Ke Lai Xuan and Yun Lai Inn were the same as them. His heart skipped a beat, but he had experienced too many things, so he didn't show it on his face, and even Pretending to be surprised did not arouse any suspicion in Hu Zhi, because he had already guessed that Ke Laixuan and Yun Lai Inn were in the same group as Hell Gate. When Shi Jin reported to him about Hell Gate before, , he had already asked other disciples to investigate the situation in other small towns, and the result was just as he expected.

All the other small towns near the Endless Abyss have inns or hotels similar to this, and they can't mess with any of them. A few people even found out something about the Hell Gate, but they only heard about its reputation. He didn't know much, and it was precisely because of this that Zhao Hai had long known that Ke Lai Xuan and Yun Lai Inn must be Hell Sect's properties, but he didn't expect that Hu Zhi and the others would actually be related to Hell Sect. .

Now when Zhao Hai heard what Hu Zhi said, his face showed a look of shock again. He looked at Hu Zhi and said: "Brother, where is this hell gate? Is it a sect? Why haven't I heard of it? There is a sect called Hell Sect. Is it a demon sect? If it is a demon sect, then brother, you must be careful. I heard that people from the demon sect treat their disciples Life, don’t take it seriously.”

Hu Zhi shook his head and said: "No, Hell Sect is not a sect. It is an organization of our casual cultivators. It can also be said to be an alliance of our casual cultivators. It is an alliance led by some masters of casual cultivators. In the end, The main purpose is to protect us casual cultivators and fight against those big sects, and he is not a sect."
