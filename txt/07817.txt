Of course, this does not mean that there is no place to release tasks in the town. In fact, the places where tasks are often released in the town are in those large stores. Those stores can release tasks. Of course, they The tasks posted are all relatively difficult tasks, and there are various requirements, but the rewards for those tasks are very high.

But what Zhao Hai said this time cannot be regarded as a task, it can only be regarded as a piece of news, so he has no choice but to ask the four stores to help him publish the task. He wants to publish the task directly. , he has to find another way.

The main reason why Zhao Hai built this school this time is actually to make the people in the town feel grateful to him. Although the people in the town have already recognized Zhao Hai, But Zhao Hai has not yet been regarded as the most respected person in the town. In other words, Zhao Hai's prestige in the town is not enough.

But this would be very detrimental to Zhao Hai's future development. It is precisely because of this that Zhao Hai thought about building a school to teach the children in the town something, so that he would get the benefits of the town. Everyone respects them. In a place like Linyuan Town, people pay more attention to their children than Zhao Hai imagined.

Old Liu Tou didn't think that much. He just felt that if Zhao Hai really gathered all the children in his home and taught those children, then it is really possible that those children would become the future of Lanka. Team, this is very important to Lanka, so he really feels that Zhao Hai's plan is very feasible.

It was precisely because of this that when he heard what Zhao Hai said, he immediately said: "It's simple. If you want everyone in the town to know about you, it's actually very simple. You just need to go there." Tell the guys at the Kelai Xuan Hotel what you are going to do, and I think the news of what you are going to do will spread throughout the town in the shortest possible time."

When Zhao Hai heard what Old Liu Tou said, he couldn't help but be stunned. Then he looked at Old Liu Tou and said, "Uncle Liu, is this really okay? I have seen that the people who go to Ke Lai Xuan to drink every day are not A lot, is it really okay to go there and spread the news?" Zhao Hai really didn't know that the Ke Lai Xuan Hotel could actually serve this purpose.

Old Liu nodded and said: "Of course, it's definitely possible. You can rest assured about this and go ahead." Old Liu knew more about what was going on at the Kelai Xuan Hotel than Zhao Hai. Every day at the Kelai Xuan Hotel Although not many people go there, it is a small town where news spreads the fastest. If people in the town have something happened, they will go there directly to hear the news. So if you have any news, please send it to me. There is absolutely no problem getting there.

Zhao Hai nodded and said: "Okay, I'll go now." After saying that, he stood up directly and said to Lanka, who was still playing with the little black demon: "Lanka, let's go." After that, he walked straight into the town. Ranka responded and immediately ran to Zhao Hai's side, and the little black demon also jumped on Ranka's shoulder.

Zhao Hai looked at Lanka and smiled at him and said: "Lanka, can you let the children in the town play with you every day? You will have a lot of friends in the future, how about it?" Zhao Hai Hai was very clear and had to make it clear to Lanka. If Lanka was really disgusted with those children studying with him, then Zhao Hai would rather give up his plan.

When Lanka heard what Zhao Hai said, his eyes couldn't help but shine, and then he said to Zhao Hai: "Master, is what you said true? If it is true, that would be great. I will follow him usually. I play with the children in the town, but sometimes I have to go outside the town, but their families don’t let them go outside the town. Now I have to study with the master, so they can’t play with me anymore.”

When Zhao Hai heard what he said, he also smiled and said: "Okay, let's go to the outside of the town now. I really want to take a look, let the news out, and see if they will be at our house with you. Let’s play.” After saying that, Zhao Hai led Lanka and walked straight to Ke Lai Xuan. After a while, the two of them arrived at Ke Lai Xuan.

After the two of them arrived at Ke Laixuan, Zhao Hai entered the store directly. As soon as Shuanzi saw Zhao Hai coming, he immediately came up to him, saluted Zhao Hai and said, "Sir, you are here, but you want to eat." What do you want?" Zhao Hai came earlier today, so there weren't many people in the store, so it was very quiet.

Zhao Hai smiled at Shuanzi and said: "Shuanzi, you don't have to be so polite. We have known each other for a long time. There is no need to call me "sir". I really didn't come here for dinner today. I have something to do. I want to invite you. Please help." Zhao Hai is still very polite to Shuanzi, and Shuanzi has always respected him very much. The relationship between the two is now good.

When Shuanzi heard what Zhao Hai said, he quickly said: "What's the matter, sir? Please just give me the order." Shuanzi respected Zhao Hai very much, because Zhao Hai's strength was there. With Zhao Hai With his strength, it is really too easy to deal with him, but Zhao Hai has always been very polite to him, so Shuanzi respects Zhao Hai more and more.

Zhao Hai smiled and said: "Shuanzi, it's like this. I want to make a news. Isn't the yard of Lanka's family always empty now? In addition, I also noticed that many children in the town are busy every day. Nothing happened, I was just having fun there. I just wanted to use the yard of Lanka’s house. Please help me spread the word that as long as the people in the town are willing, they can send their children there every day. Go to Lanka's house, I will help take care of them, teach them some basic spells, and provide the team with three meals a day. They only need to give me a spiritual stone every month."

When Shuanzi heard what Zhao Hai said, he couldn't help but be stunned, and then he immediately said: "Sir, do you really want to do this? If you are really willing to do this, then you have helped the people in the town. I'm very busy." Shuanzi is quite familiar with the situation in the town. He knows very well that although the people in the town attach great importance to their children, they are actually burdened by their children. If Zhao Hai can really help the people in the town, If a person only needs one spiritual stone every month to take care of his children, then the people in the town will definitely be very willing.

But then he continued: "If you are really willing to do this, my lord, then the spirit stone you receive is too little. If you do this, you will lose money. I think you might as well do this, lord. You can Help the people in the gang to take care of the children. Each child receives one spirit stone, but each child must be responsible for what he eats. They give you spirit stones and let you buy food by yourself, or you can directly put the food away. What do you think?" I'll send it to you, and you'll just be responsible for doing it well for them, what do you think?"

When Zhao Hai heard what Shuan Zi said, he thought about it and agreed. He knew that if he really only accepted a piece of spiritual stone, he would help the people in the town take care of the children, and also provide food for those children. The people on the street might suspect his intentions, but if he collected the food, the people in the town might feel more at ease. Sometimes people are actually so strange. They don't believe in people's kindness. On the contrary, I just believe that you may have some agenda for doing this.

As soon as Shuanzi saw that Zhao Hai agreed, he smiled and said: "Okay, then this matter is settled. Sir, you can go back and wait for the news. I will send the news to you today. I believe the people in the town will know the news soon." Zhao Hai nodded, thanked Shuanzi, then turned and left.

The next morning, when Zhao Hai was teaching Lanka to practice Jiujijutsu, he heard someone knocking on the door. He immediately opened the door. As soon as the door opened, he saw a woman standing outside the door. This The woman looked to be in her thirties and was wearing a somewhat shabby-looking samurai uniform. She was not ugly, but she was not beautiful either, but there was a trace of heroism about her.

As soon as the woman saw Zhao Hai, she immediately clasped her fists at Zhao Hai and said in a deep voice: "But in front of Mr. Zhao Ying? My name is Yao Yan. I heard yesterday that the children in the town can study here. I would like to ask Sir how the fees are charged here and what the teachings are."

Yao Yan was very direct and asked directly what she wanted to know. When Zhao Hai heard what he said, he also smiled and said: "Sister-in-law Yao, please come in and tell me." Yao Yan also agreed. Without being polite, he entered the courtyard directly. As soon as he entered the courtyard, he saw Lanka who was practicing. She didn't say anything when she arrived. She just took a look and turned to look at Zhao Hai.

Zhao Hai smiled at Yao Yan and said: "Sister-in-law Yao, you have also seen that there are quite a lot of Lanka's yard. I think it is empty. I also saw that there are many children in the town, and they have no one." I'm here to take care of it. I'm running around outside every day. I just want to gather these children together, let them learn something, teach them how to read, and teach them some of the simplest spells. If there is a chance, I will also teach them. Go to the woods outside the town to see them, and cook three meals a day for them. That's it. You will be charged one spiritual stone every month. If you want me to buy food or other things on your behalf, you will have to pay an extra spiritual stone every month. , if you deliver the food yourself, you won’t be charged for it, what do you think?”

When Yao Yan heard what Zhao Hai said, she couldn't help but be stunned. Then she frowned and said, "You still want to take the children to the woods outside the town? Will that be dangerous?" Yao Yan felt that Zhao Hai's charges It was already very reasonable. She was just a little worried about whether there would be any danger if Zhao Hai really took all those children outside the town.

When Zhao Hai heard what he said, he immediately said in a deep voice: "Sister-in-law Yao can rest assured that I can guarantee the safety of the children. I will take the children to the woods and not let them go too far. We will just let the children walk around and let them know some plants, so they will definitely be fine."

Yao Yan thought for a while, nodded and said, "Okay, then I'll go back and discuss it. If there's no problem, I'll send the child over tomorrow, okay?" It was obvious that Yao Yan was very tempted, looking at her look , if there are no accidents, then a child will definitely be delivered tomorrow.
