c7055 Five Elements Killer

The fighting power of the Blood Killing Battle Fort is very powerful, but that refers to a group battle. If it is a single enemy, it may not be able to do anything to the opponent, especially if the opponent is a master. Although the combat power of the Blood Killing Battle Fort is It is very powerful and not easy to be broken by those masters, but it is also very difficult to kill those masters. Therefore, masters like Ding Chunming are needed in the Blood Killing Battle Fort. Once it is found that a master wants to It was their turn to take action against the bloody battle fort.

However, Ding Chunming seldom talks at ordinary times. He is really not interested in management matters. In the past, Ding Chunming would still take care of some things. After joining the Blood Killing Sect, he seldom took care of things. In the past, he rarely took care of things. He would also serve as a guard for Zhao Hai, but later Zhao Hai asked him to concentrate on training. He had been working hard, and now he was just training disciples, and Zhao Hai's guard became Cheng Wanchun , Of course, Cheng Wanchun is not always with Zhao Hai. He also has his own position in the Blood Killing Sect, so there is really no guard around Zhao Hai now.

People like Chang Jun and others may not know much about Ding Chunming, because Ding Chunming is too low-key. They only know that Ding Chunming, like Wen Wenhai and others, has been following Zhao Hai since he went to the lower world. , but they seldom spoke and did not hold any positions, but they also gave Ding Chunming the respect he deserved.

But Wen Wenhai knew very well who Ding Chunming was, and also knew the weight of Ding Chunming's words in Zhao Hai's heart, so when he heard Ding Chunming yelling, he was startled, and he immediately turned around to look at Ding Chunming said in a deep voice: "Old Ding, is there anything wrong?"

Ding Chunming said in a deep voice: "Simply changing the energy of the shield is not a good idea. Today the enemy can have snakes that are not afraid of fire, and tomorrow they will have snakes that are not afraid of other energy attributes. What will we do by then? What to do? If all of our attribute shields have a kind of snake that can restrain them, what should we do? So I think this is not a good idea, we should think about it the other way around."

Wen Wenhai looked at Ding Chunming with some confusion, and Chang Jun also said to Ding Chunming with confusion: "Think about it the other way around? What does this mean?" Chang Jun really didn't quite understand what Ding Chunming meant. , after all, he still knew too little about Ding Chunming. He didn't know that among the people present, he was the one who had followed Zhao Hai the longest.

Ding Chunming said: "Master, there is a very powerful magic circle there. I don't know if Shenji Hall has it. It is the Five Elements Killing Array. All energy related to the Five Elements attributes cannot pass through that array. It will be decomposed into the most primitive five elements energy by those large formations. If we want to improve this large formation so that it can block the power of Buddha and curse at the same time, then the power of this large formation will be It’s very powerful, and by that time, we can use this formation as our mountain protection formation.”

At this point, he paused for a moment, and then said with some regret: "However, this kind of magic circle also has a disadvantage, that is, it cannot attack from the inside out. It is different from the shield we use now, so that's not the case. That is to say, if we want to attack the enemy in the future, we must open the shield and then attack the enemy."

As soon as they heard what he said, everyone's faces showed a pensive look, but then everyone turned their attention to Wen Yuming. If there is such a magic array as the Five Elements Killing Formation, Shenji Hall has it. Then they must have researched and understood it. If they haven't, then they can only ask Zhao Hai for help on this matter.

Wen Yuming shook his head and said: "No, our Shenji Hall really does not have such a five-element killing formation. It seems that the only way to deal with this matter is to invite the sect master. I will go now." Wen Yuming is about to leave. Wen Yuming can be said to be a magic circle fanatic. He is also very obsessed with magic circles. Now when he hears about such a powerful magic circle, but he doesn't know how to do it, naturally it is I want it right away.

Wen Wenhai immediately said: "Hold on, Lao Wen, you'd better not go ahead with this matter. Let Lao Ding go. Lao Ding, among us, you are the only one who has been following the leader the longest, and it was you who proposed this plan." If it comes out, then you go and save the sect master. The sect leader has not taken out this magic circle yet, which means that this kind of magic circle has its own uniqueness. The sect leader may not want to take it out, so it is up to you. .”

Ding Chunming shook his head and said: "No, it's impossible for the young master not to come up with something good. If he didn't come up with something good, there must be other reasons, but I will still ask the young master if this matter is right." It works, I'll go." After saying that, he moved and disappeared.

Ding Chunming quickly arrived outside Zhao Hai's room. Before he could open the door, the door opened, and Zhao Hai's voice came: "Come in." Ding Chunming responded, and then walked in directly. Zhao Hai is now sitting in a polite room, and Ding Chunming immediately saluted Zhao Hai.

Zhao Hai waved his hand and then said in a deep voice: "I know everything you said. You are here for the Five Elements Ultimate Killing Formation. In fact, I have already known about the Five Elements Ultimate Killing Formation. They are just separated. I just took it out, here you go, these are the several magic formations that make up the Five Elements Ultimate Array. If you show it to Wen Yuming, they will know at a glance. In fact, the Five Elements Ultimate Array is really not suitable for protecting the mountain. Formation, because he has no way to attack outwards, and there is no good solution to this situation, but it will not be a problem for our disciples to get in and out."

Ding Chunming took the jade slip that Zhao Hai threw to him and responded. Zhao Hai looked at it and said: "Go, let Wen Yuming and the others get out the Five Elements Killing Formation as soon as possible, and hold on for a while first. Then I'm thinking of ways to deal with those red snakes, go ahead." Ding Chunming responded, turned around and left.

Watching Ding Chunming leave, Zhao Hai smiled slightly. Guys like Wen Wenhai and others sometimes like to think wildly. The Five Elements Killing Formation may be very threatening to Zhao Hai, but for now For him, there is no threat. In addition to this magic circle, it is really not suitable for the mountain protection formation, because once the Five Elements Ultimate Killing Formation is used as the registration protection formation, the Blood Killing Sect's Almost all energy weapons are useless, even the sky full of fire and the attacks of magic weapons are useless. Of course, his defense ability is also very powerful.

However, the Blood Killing Sect has a lot of energy weapons. If all the energy weapons of the Blood Killing Sect cannot be used, then the loss will be huge for the Blood Killing Sect, and it may even be a bit outweighing the gain, but for Wen Wenhai and the others It is very feasible to use the Five Elements Killing Formation as a mountain protection formation. This incident can also allow Wen Yuming and the others to study the Five Elements Killing Formation.

There is no other reason why he didn't tell Wen Yuming about this matter before. It's just because he forgot. It's not wrong. He just forgot that Zhao Hai separated the Five Elements Killing Formation and gave it to Wen Yuming. After naming them, he rarely asked about this matter, and eventually he naturally forgot about it, but he didn't expect that it would be used again today, so he remembered it.

After Ding Chunming returned to the Snake World base, he found that Wen Wenhai and the others were still there. Ding Chunming glanced at them, then turned to Wen Yuming and said: "The young master said that the Five Elements Killing Formation has been given to you a long time ago, but He separated the Five Elements Killing Formation and gave it to you. This is what the young master gave you." After saying that, Ding Chunming gave Wen Yuming the jade slip that Zhao Hai gave him.

Wen Yuming took the jade slip, and when he mentally looked into the jade slip, he saw five magic formations in the jade slip. As soon as he saw these five magic formations, Wen Yuming was stunned, and then he He couldn't help but slap his head hard and cursed: "I'm so stupid." After saying that, he put away the jade slips, turned around and walked out.

Wen Wenhai said quickly: "Lao Wen, what's going on? What are you going to do?" After hearing what Zhao Hai said before, Wen Wenhai already knew that Zhao Hai must have given the Five Elements Killing Formation to Wen Yuming and the others. , it's just that they didn't find it because Wen Yuming was about to leave. Now he saw that Wen Yuming was leaving, so he asked. He actually knew that Wen Yuming wanted to return to Shenji Hall to study it carefully. This Five Elements Killing Formation, but he mainly wanted to know when the Five Elements Killing Formation could be set up, so he stopped Wen Yuming.

Wen Yuming paused for a moment, turned to Wen Wenhai and smiled bitterly: "You can rest assured when we go back to do the experiment. If our experiment is successful, then we will soon be able to set up the Five Elements Killing Formation, because the sect leader said The several magic formations that came out are the ones we use most frequently. We have always thought that there is nothing special about these magic formations, but we did not expect that when they are combined, it will be a five-element killer. Great formation.”

Speaking of this, Yu Yu couldn't help but look ashamed. He smiled bitterly and said: "The sect leader has reminded us many times that the more ordinary things are, the more they are the basis of a system. The formation symbols are like this, and the techniques are like this. But before But we did not include the magic circle. I have to go back now to compare different magic circles. I want to know how many good things we have missed. Oh my god, I am such a pig. The sect master has long been The best thing in the world was put into my hands, but I didn't notice it and thought it was just a stone. I will bear the guilt even to death."

Hearing what he said, Wen Wenhai and the others couldn't help but laugh. Chang Jun smiled and said: "Lao Wen, don't worry, I don't think the sect master will blame you, but the sect master didn't tell you about the formation. You discover it yourself, and you should also know that if you discover this matter yourself, it will make a much deeper impression than if the sect leader tells you directly. Okay, we won't stop you, but what do you want to do? We don’t care about research, but what we need most here now is the Five Elements Killing Formation. You must get it as soon as possible, because not only we need it here, but also those small bases, and the Blood Killing Battle Fort also needs it. So you must hurry up, and you must not miss our affairs. Once our affairs here are resolved, we will not care how you want to study them."
