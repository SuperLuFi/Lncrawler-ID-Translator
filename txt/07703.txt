Hu An walked out of his meditation room. He didn't feel any surprise. He had already come out once. After he woke up, he immediately wrote a letter to Emperor Shakti and was now on his way to the Jade Buddha. At the Zen Temple, when he passed the teleportation array and arrived at the Jade Buddha Zen Temple, he found that many people had already arrived.

When he arrived in the main hall, he saw Emperor Shitian already sitting in the hall waiting for them. Hu An walked to his seat and sat down, waiting for the others to arrive. After everyone arrived, Emperor Shitian Tian then opened his eyes, he glanced at everyone, and then said: "Okay, everyone is here. I have assigned tasks to everyone before. When everyone arrives at the real illusion, just follow the tasks I assigned. Okay, I called you here today not because I want to tell you about this battle, but because I want to tell you about the Blood Killing Sect and about the real illusion. I wonder if anyone has any thoughts about the real illusion?"

When everyone heard what Di Shitian said, they couldn't help but be stunned. They really didn't quite understand what Di Shitian meant. When Di Shitian looked at the faces of everyone, he couldn't help but smile slightly, and then he spoke. He said: "I don't know if you have ever thought about it. In addition to being used to train disciples and conduct such tests, that real illusion has no other use. Let's think about it carefully."

To be honest, Emperor Shitian was actually a little disappointed when he saw everyone's performance, because in his opinion, the real illusion had endless magical uses, but these people had never thought about it at all, which made him feel confused for a while. He smiled bitterly, but he still gave them some hints to see how these people would react.

Sure enough, when they heard what Emperor Shitian said, everyone was stunned for a moment, and then all of their faces showed pensive expressions. Naturally, Hu An was the same. As long as he thought deeply, he immediately understood what Emperor Shitian meant. At the same time, his face became serious, and then he immediately said: "Holy Lord, the real illusion has endless uses. Take alchemy as an example. We used to make alchemy, no matter how easy it is, it is actually There is a success rate. For some particularly precious elixirs, the materials are also very precious and very rare. If the refining fails, it will be all over. If there is a real illusion, it is really the same as the outside world. If so, you can practice it first in the real illusion. Anyway, all the medicinal materials there are fake. Even if you waste a lot of the refining, you won't be heartbroken. Once you are confident, you can really start refining the elixir. In that case, you will succeed. The rate will increase, and it can even guarantee 100% success. This alone makes people extremely enviable, not to mention that there is also the ability to accelerate time in the real illusion. Forty hours there, it is only quite a few hours outside. Four hours have passed, and the time difference in between is enough for people to do a lot of things."

Everyone in the hall nodded, they also thought of this, and Hu Jing also said at this time: "Apart from this, the only other thing is that if they start a war with us, they can completely destroy the battlefield. Record the situation above, and then put it into the real illusion to study, and finally find the best way to crack it. It can be said that facing such an enemy, we have no possibility of victory at all."

Everyone's faces were extremely solemn, but they still agreed with Hu Jing's words. Emperor Shitian looked at everyone's expressions, and then said: "Everyone is right, after having this real illusion, it is equivalent to having unlimited possibilities. Not only can it be used for refining elixirs, refining weapons, or fighting, it is also very convenient for improving skills, improving techniques, and learning some things. I have always been a little strange before, people from the Blood Killing Sect, If most of them ascended from the lower realm, then how did their strength become so strong in such a short period of time? It is very difficult for people who ascended from the lower realm to improve their strength. , but the Blood Killing Sect has so many masters, which is obviously very unreasonable. Now I finally understand that as long as there is this real illusion, it is not difficult for the Blood Killing Sect to become stronger."

Everyone nodded once. They had not thought about the magical effects of this real illusion before. Now that they started to think about the magical effects of this real illusion, they were really shocked. Only then did they discover that the people of the Blood Killing Sect , it is not unreasonable to be strong.

Emperor Shitian looked at the faces of everyone, and then said after a while: "Okay, I called everyone here today, and I want to tell everyone this. I just want to tell everyone that after this test, we will all join the bloody battle." , and this decision will definitely not make anyone regret it, and it is a good thing for everyone."

Everyone responded with a roar. Looking at it now, joining the Blood Killing Sect is indeed a good thing. Emperor Shitian then said: "Okay, everyone should go back. In eight hours, it will be the first time." It’s time to enter the real illusion for the second time. Then the war will begin. Fight hard. Don’t let it go just because you want to join the Blood Killing Sect in the future. No one will die in the real illusion, and there is no need to hold back. , that’s all we need to do is attack with all our strength.”

Everyone responded, and looking at everyone's appearance, Emperor Shitian waved his hands, and everyone saluted him, then turned and left, but this time each of them had a trace of relaxation on their faces. Expressions, and at the same time, there was a trace of expectation on their faces.

They suddenly discovered that joining the Blood Killing Sect seemed to have many benefits. Although they were all Buddhists and looked down upon these outsiders, in any case, they were all monks who pursued the path to immortality. They are still very concerned about it, so they now have no aversion to joining the Blood Killing Sect.

Eight hours passed quickly. When the hour came, no one needed to remind them this time. All the disciples in the heaven and human world activated the magic circle and entered the real illusion. Hu An also arrived at the real illusion at this time, and then he began to defend the disciples with all their strength.

While he was arranging his disciples for defense, he heard a voice saying: "Report, host, a large number of disciples of the Blood Killing Sect were found in the forest, and they are slowly coming towards us. Their speed is not Very quickly, but the number of people is very large, and wherever they go, they will plant some plants, I don’t know what they are doing, it looks very weird.”

When Hu An heard what the disciple said, he was stunned, and then his expression turned bitter. He really didn't expect that the people of the Blood Killing Sect would repeat the attack from the outside world again. This time It gave him a very strange feeling, but he still said: "Gather all the people in the temple, and let's go to the square outside the temple. I really want to see how effective these people of the Blood Killing Sect are in combat."

When the disciple heard what Hu An said, he couldn't help but be startled, and then a strange look appeared on his face, because he clearly remembered that Hu An's order was given when he was in the heaven and human world. He had issued this order once, that is, when he first discovered the Blood Killing Sect, he had issued such an order, but at that time they did not know that the other party was called the Blood Killing Sect. Apart from this, Hu An's order , the order given was exactly the same as when he was in the Heavenly Realm, that's why he had such an expression on his face.

However, he still responded and immediately went to deliver the order. Then everyone in Nan Hu Zun Temple gathered in the square outside the temple. Everyone held their weapons with strange expressions, and Hu An also held Holding the tiger head Zen staff, he stood in front of everyone, waving the Zen staff from time to time, making bursts of tiger roaring sounds.

And as he discovered the sound of tiger roars here, soon, there were also the sounds of tiger roars coming from several other directions, which made everyone's expressions even weirder, because they knew that maybe it was from several other buildings. The situation in the temple was the same as them, everyone followed the previous script again.

Not only them, but also Bai Yan and the others looked at each other in confusion after knowing this situation. Then Bai Yan glanced at Gu Yuanzheng standing beside him with a strange expression, and said: "Lao Gu, what do these guys want to do? Do they think that our attack this time is the same as the attack in the outside world, so they are also cooperating with us and acting out this drama? Are they too underestimated our Blood Killing Sect? "

Gu Yuanzheng's face was also very strange. He said solemnly: "It is indeed very strange. No matter how much I say, they may have their reasons for doing this. We just need to attack. I think we will attack as before. Method." Gu Yuanzheng will not be polite. He doesn't care what the reason is for the other party to do this, but they will not be polite. Anyway, this is a real illusion. Even if they kill all those people, they will not be polite. There won't be any real deaths, so there's nothing to worry about.

Baiyan smiled slightly and said: "Okay, then let's attack with all our strength. Inform all the disciples to prepare. Aren't the enemies all outside the temple? Then everyone should fly up and attack directly. Use the most violent attack to kill them directly." Get it for me, I really want to see how effective these guys are in fighting."

Immediately, a staff officer responded, and then went directly to deliver the order. Not long after, the Blood Killing Sect's army flew directly from the woods, formed a neat formation in the sky, and then headed straight towards the tigers in all directions. Zunji pounced on them. They were very fast, but their formation remained intact and looked very beautiful.

Hu An also received the news, and he immediately ordered: "Everyone, fly up. The people of the Blood Killing Sect want to attack us from the sky, so we have to give them a hard blow from the sky. I I want to see what their strength is and how they can act." Everyone responded, and then everyone flew up, each one tightly holding the weapons in their hands, and their faces, They even showed murderous intent, and some disciples' eyes flashed with wild and bloodthirsty light. It was obvious that the beastly nature was slowly awakening in their bodies!
