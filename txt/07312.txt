ah! A scream came, and the snake demon prince's head was cut off by Gu Yuanzheng's knife. Then the snake demon prince turned into a black smoke and disappeared directly. Gu Yuanzheng then put away the knife, and At this time, he also noticed that the island under his feet was slowly turning into black smoke, but he did not pay attention, but turned to look at Wen Wenhai and the others.

Wen Wenhai smiled at Gu Yuanzheng and said, "What's the matter, Lao Gu? Your hands are itchy today? Why did you take action yourself? Who is that guy? He didn't even get hit by the mushroom trick, which is good." Wen Wenhai and the others really didn't Knowing the identity of the Snake Demon Prince, that's why I asked.

Gu Yuanzheng smiled and said: "The one named Prince Snake Demon, his identity is not simple, he is the commander of the Yaksha clan coalition this time, hahahaha, as for why he didn't get the mushroom trick, then I really don't know. ." He laughed loudly while talking about the ancient expedition. He was actually quite grateful to the snake demon prince. If it hadn't been for the snake demon prince's sudden move, they wouldn't have been able to keep all the Yaksha clan's army behind. Here, although some Yashas have escaped, they are just two or three kittens and have no impact on the overall situation.

Wen Wenhai couldn't help being surprised when he heard what Gu Yuanzheng said, and then he couldn't help laughing and said: "So, we still have to thank him, but it's better to let him leave this world earlier. , maybe I can get a good pregnancy, hahahaha." Everyone else laughed along with him.

Gu Yuanzheng looked at the island that had completely disappeared, and then he said to Wen Wenhai: "Old Wen, the war here is over. Should we fight on the battlefield and prepare for the next attack?" Gu Yuanzheng I know that not many people from the Blood Killing Sect really contributed to this battle. Most of the disciples just ran forward behind the Blood Killing Battle Castle. As they ran, they found that the enemy had disappeared. Under this situation, they were naturally not tired at all. On the contrary, they felt unhappy because there was no battle. That's why Gu Yuanzheng wanted to tell Wen Wenhai whether they could continue the attack.

Wen Wenhai said with a smile: "It's time to prepare. Let everyone clean up the battlefield, and then go back and have a good rest. We will discuss it, and then we will attack with all our strength." Everyone responded, and then with a movement of their bodies, everyone Returning to the Xuanwu Space, Wen Wenhai first ordered the disciples who had been killed by Blood to fight on the battlefield. Then he came to the main hall and at the same time recruited all the core elders of the Blood Kill Sect. In the main hall.

When everyone arrived in the main hall, they found that Zhao Hai had also arrived. Everyone quickly saluted Zhao Hai. Zhao Hai waved his hands to everyone, and then said with a smile: "Don't be so polite, you performed very well this time, really. Very good, I'm very happy, seeing your performance now, I feel relieved, now you can really stand alone."

Everyone laughed. They could see that Zhao Hai was very happy today, so they were all quite relaxed. Zhao Hai looked at everyone, smiled slightly and said: "Our Blood Killing Sect must emphasize our own practice and improve our strength. At the same time, we cannot give up on external forces, whether it is magic weapons, spiritual plants, or spiritual plants. No matter beasts, we cannot give up these things, and all these things have only one purpose, which is to make us stronger. The reason why I emphasize that everyone’s own strength must be strong is because, if you just If you rely on external force, it will always be external force. Once one day, there is no support from external force, what will you do? You will not be able to do anything? So we must make ourselves strong, make ourselves strong, and one more thing The good thing is that when you are stronger, you will become more powerful when you use magic weapons. This is the normal development trajectory of a monk."

Everyone responded in unison, Zhao Hai looked at them, and then said: "Okay, everyone, sit down. Although our disciples of the Blood Killing Sect did not directly participate in this battle, it is also a good thing. , I said, we are here to train our troops. Now the training the Yasha clan can give us has almost reached the limit. They can no longer let us move forward, so there is no need for us to be polite to them. That is There is no need to use them to train troops anymore, just deal with them directly."

When everyone heard what Zhao Hai said, they all agreed. They also understood that Zhao Hai's meaning was very obvious, which was to tell them that what they did this time was not wrong, and there was no need to deal with the Yasha clan in the future. Likewise, if they have to fight against the Yaksha Clan, all things like mushrooms and Skyfire can be used. This is definitely good news for them. This means that if they want to deal with the Yaksha Clan in the future, they will not have to use it. There will be too many casualties.

After everyone sat down, Zhao Hai then continued: "Tell me, what are your plans next, Wen Hai, you tell me first, you are the commander now, you should know it, right?" Zhao Hai knew, This meeting was called by Wen Wenhai. There was nothing to summarize about this battle. So Wen Wenhai must have called everyone here for the purpose of fighting against the Yasha clan in the future, so he asked directly. .

Wen Wenhai stood up, smiled at Zhao Hai and said: "Boss, you really have a burning gaze. We really want to discuss the next plan this time. I mean, now the main force of the Yasha clan has been We have wiped out tens of billions of people. Although some of the Yakshas have escaped, it doesn't matter. What I mean is that we should attack with all our strength and attack from all directions to destroy the entire Yaksha world. , capture it as soon as possible, and then attack the next interface."

When Zhao Hai heard what Wen Wenhai said, he couldn't help but nodded and said: "It's really time to think about these things now. If so many of the Yaksha clan's army were wiped out at once, they shouldn't have much power to fight back. , we attack with all our strength, take down the Yasha clan as soon as possible, and then deal with other interfaces, it is indeed time."

Wen Wenhai nodded, and then he continued: "We have been delayed a lot of time here in the Yaksha Realm, and it is time to end the battle with the Yaksha Clan. However, there should be some masters here in the Yaksha Clan. We must You have to be prepared, the masters of the Yasha clan are still very strong."

Zhao Hai nodded, Wen Wenhai sat down, and Gu Yuanzheng also stood up and said: "Young Master, the masters of the Yaksha clan are indeed very strong. They can also use kung fu techniques. They fought against me before. That snake demon prince, his skill blessing is very good, I also spent a lot of effort to deal with him, and in my opinion, he doesn't seem to be the top of the Yaksha clan. If we meet the top masters of the Yasha clan, I’m afraid they won’t be their opponents, so we must be careful.”

Zhao Hai nodded, waved his hand for him to sit down, and then said: "No matter how many masters they have, as long as they dare to mess around, we will not be polite to them. If necessary, I will take action directly , after all, masters are different from ordinary disciples. If any of you fall into the hands of the Yasha clan, our losses will be considerable. Your strength is there, although everyone has it. A lot of lives, but after dying once, it will take a lot of time for the strength to return to its original level."

Wen Wenhai and the others know this. Like ordinary disciples, if they die once, their strength will decline, but their strength will not drop much. It is not difficult to return to the original level, but like Wen Wenhai and the others If these people's strength is reduced, it will not be easy to recover, so Zhao Hai doesn't want them to have any surprises, so he said this. Of course, they also understand what Zhao Hai means.

Zhao Hai looked at everyone and said in a deep voice: "Go and prepare, take down the Yasha clan as soon as possible. Remember my words, if you really encounter someone who is difficult to deal with, just tell me directly. I also have a long time." I haven’t taken any action anymore. I really want to take action recently. Okay, let’s go down.” Everyone responded, saluted Zhao Hai, then turned and left.

Zhao Hai said at this time: "Hu Wei, I heard that you two will stay for a while." The two of them responded and stayed, but the others left. As soon as they heard the two words Zhao Hai left behind, Personally, I know that Zhao Hai must have something to ask the two of them to do. One of them is in charge of the Shenji Hall and the other is in charge of the Lingzhi Hall. The things they are asked to do must be technical, so everyone Didn't even take it to heart.

Zhao Hai looked at the two of them, smiled slightly and said: "In recent times, your performance has been very good. I am very happy. I have you here this time. I have several requirements for you. The first is Hu Wei. , Hu Wei, your Ling Zhi Tang has done very well recently. I am very happy to see it. However, the movement of your bread tree and Babel vine is still a big problem. I think you can find someone from the undead clan on this point. People, just tell them, I said it, let them cooperate. Among the undead clan, there is also a clan of undead demon plants. Those undead demon plants can fly and their speed is not slow. You can learn from them. , also make some improvements to your spiritual plants."

Hu Wei responded. She was also thinking about this problem now. The combat effectiveness of Bread Tree and Babel Vine was not bad, but their moving speed has always been a big problem. Bread Tree's current moving speed is very slow, and Babel Vine is moving very slowly. The vine cannot move at all. This is indeed a big problem. They have been thinking about how to improve it, but they have never thought of the undead clan. Now that Zhao Hai said this, Hu Wei's heart rose. A glimmer of hope.

Zhao Hai turned to Wen Yuming again and said: "Lao Wen, you have done very well, but the power of the incarnation outside your body has not been exerted to the limit. On this point, I suggest you talk to the people from the Spirit Beast Hall. Let’s study it carefully together. As for how far we can achieve it in the end, it depends on you.”
