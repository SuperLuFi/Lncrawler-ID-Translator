c7682 Task

Everyone, you look at me, I look at you, everyone finally nodded, Chang Jun said: "Okay, then for one month, we should prepare for the attack on the heaven and human world. After everyone goes back, hurry up It took time to resolve the matters at hand. As for what the sect leader said about setting up a law enforcement department in each branch, I think this matter must be resolved separately. This matter can be solved by Uncle Yao and Zhu. Yong, Lao Ding, Lao Hu, you are responsible for everything. From now on, you will be responsible for all the affairs of the law enforcement departments. If there are any problems with law enforcement, you can handle them directly. If you really can't handle them, let us Let’s discuss it together. If we can’t make up our minds, we’ll report it to the sect leader to resolve it. What do you think?”

Making the law enforcement department independent is the core content of what Zhao Hai said this time, so when he heard what he said, everyone nodded. No one would object. Yao Jianhao is the most powerful and the most humane person in the sect. To be fair, although Hu Changfeng is a low-key person in the sect, his prestige has grown because of his training of disciples, and he has always been famous for being fair and selfless. As for Zhu Yong, he is the leader of the entire sect. The head of the intelligence department, it is indeed a waste not to let him participate in the law enforcement department, and he is also Zhao Hai's confidant. As for Ding Chunming, not to mention, he is the second master of the sect, and in the entire In the sect, except for Zhao Hai, no one can match his strength. To a certain extent, his status in the hearts of his disciples is higher than that of people like Yao Jianhao or Wen Wenhai. I believe he will save a lot of trouble by joining the law enforcement department, and with Ding Chunming and Zhu Yong here, absolutely no one will dare to offend the law enforcement department. These two are too close to Zhao Hai.

So after Chang Jun put forward this opinion, everyone nodded in agreement. Even Jiuling Lao and the others did not object. Jiuling Lao and the others have been learning about the Blood Killing Sect these days. They not only understand the Blood Killing Sect's abilities. Fa, those who are still understanding the Blood Killing Sect, the most important thing is the core elders of the Blood Killing Sect. They must know that the relationship between those core elders of the Blood Killing Sect and the sect leader is better.

After finally getting to know each other, they realized that Ding Chunming, who had always seemed extremely low-key in the Blood Killing Sect and did not seem to have much real power, was the person closest to Zhao Hai, because Ding Chunming was the one so far. Except for Laura and the others, the old man who has followed Zhao Hai for the longest time has always been Zhao Hai's guard before, and he is still now, but Zhao Hai is too strong and does not need their protection at all. He holds the position of instructor of the special disciples of the Blood Killing Sect. Although his status does not seem to be high, it can be said that he now controls the most powerful fighting force in the entire Blood Killing Sect. This fighting force is even greater than that of the Blood Killing Sect. The combat effectiveness of Sha Zong's cavalry team is even stronger.

Yao Jianhao was the person who helped Zhao Hai tremendously when he established the new Blood Killing Sect. In the end, he also brought the Troll Sect and joined the Blood Killing Sect as a whole. Zhao Hai has always respected him very much. Zhu Yong is the head of the Blood Killing Sect's intelligence department. This position is equivalent to Zhao Hai's eyes and ears. If he is not an absolute confidant, it is absolutely impossible to sit in this position.

Among these four people, the only one who is not very close to Zhao Hai is Hu Changfeng. However, Hu Changfeng is dedicated to training. He almost completely ignores any human affairs incidents, saying that he is The most impartial people in the Blood Killing Sect have no problems, so there is nothing wrong with letting the four of them be responsible for the law enforcement tasks of the Blood Killing Sect.

It is precisely because of these reasons that no one objected to Chang Jun's proposal. Yao Jianhao and the others did not say anything. The four of them stood up immediately, clasped their fists at everyone, and sat down directly. They also knew that this task They must take the next step and cannot refuse.

Seeing that they had accepted this task, Wen Wenhai and Chang Jun both breathed a sigh of relief, and then Chang Jun continued: "Okay, then I will leave this matter to you. Apart from this matter, When it comes to fighting, I think we should share our efforts. When fighting, we can be divided into two departments. One department is responsible for commanding the battle. This department is composed of me and my boss. Wen is personally responsible, but I want Bai Yan to be the frontline commander. The frontline commander I am talking about does not refer to the frontline commander in this interface, but in all future battles, the frontline commander will be all Judging from Bai Yan, Lao Wen and I will provide him with the greatest support from behind. Whatever the battle on the front is, it will be left to Bai Yan to direct it. Do you have any opinions?"

This time, everyone discussed quietly for a while, and then Gu Yuanzheng said: "I agree. Speaking of which, there are really not many people in the entire sect who can be better than Lao Bai in terms of command. I have no objection to him being a frontline commander." One person started, that would be easy to handle, and the others all agreed when they thought of Bai Yan's commanding ability.

Chang Jun nodded, and then said: "The second part of the war is the staff. This part is still the responsibility of the veteran. To be honest, the staff has made such rapid progress under the command of the veteran. It's really This really surprised me, so I completely agree to let Mr. Zhen serve as the commander of this staff."

No one has any objections to this at all, everyone agrees, because the staff department has always been managed by the formation boss, and the management is very good, so of course no one has any objections. Jin Lao and Bai Yan both stood up and saluted everyone, and they both accepted the task.

Chang Jun then nodded and said: "Elder Jiu Suan, you Jiusu Turtle clan, from now on, use the main development direction in the layout of the frontline arrays. There are still too few changes in the layout of our frontline arrays. The ones used on the front lines are still too few. There is a big difference between the magic circle and the magic circle studied by Shenji Hall, so you, the Jiu Shugui clan, should focus your main energy on this matter in the future, what do you think?"

The old man Jiusuan stood up and said in a deep voice: "Yes, these few battles have also made us discover this problem. When fighting the enemy on the front line, there are really too few magic formations we can use. It is very troublesome to set up some magic circles, and I also think that we must increase our research efforts in this area, so I took over this task."

Chang Jun nodded, and then he turned to look at Wen Wenhai, wanting to see if Wen Wenhai had anything else to say. Wen Wenhai glanced at everyone, and then said: "Elder Jiuling, the training of the Hai Clan, you You must keep an eye on them more. The Hai Clan will also be very important to the development of the sect in the future. Lao Gu and Lao Shu, you two must take good care of your clansmen. As for Hu Wei and Lao Wen, you From now on, let’s focus all our energy on research.” Both of them agreed, expressing their agreement that they would not object to this matter, because this is their job.

Wen Wenhai then turned his attention to Wu Long and the proprietress, and then said: "Wu Long, you will definitely practice hard in the future. I will prepare you to join the frontline team when fighting the enemy. Some reconnaissance tasks will be handed over to you, boss lady. In the sect, you are also a veteran in intelligence. I am going to transfer you to the front line to analyze some intelligence on the front line. This job will be left to you. You two, you two may be very busy in the future, as well as Elder Darkmoon, the ghost clan can be said to be the best reconnaissance force in the world, but now you are focusing your main energy on research. I just want to ask you if there are any clan members in your clan who don’t want to do research or want to fight. If so, you can let them join the team.”

When Elder Dark Moon, who had never had any sense of existence, heard what Wen Wenhai said, he couldn't help but nodded and said: "In recent years, there are really some tribesmen who want to participate in the battle. I will take them Transferred to the frontline team." Elder Dark Moon is the leader of the ghost clan, so he also knows the situation of the ghost clan very well.

In fact, there are a lot of ghosts in the Blood Killing Sect now. In addition to the old ghosts, there are also many new ghosts. These new ghosts are not very good at studying magic circles and so on. Interested, they prefer fighting. Elder Darkmoon was still troubled by this matter, but now it is better and this matter has been resolved.

Wen Wenhai nodded and said: "Let's do this. After they are transferred to the front line, they will be directly under the management of the boss's wife. Wulong, you will also be under the management of the boss's wife in the future. You are mainly responsible for the intelligence on the front line, that is, during the war. Intelligence, wartime intelligence is different from ordinary intelligence. Lao Zhu and the others are responsible for ordinary intelligence, while wartime intelligence is yours to take care of."

Several people all responded. The so-called wartime intelligence is actually the deployment of some of the enemy's troops, when they will send out troops, how many troops there are, and some information that can only be obtained during wartime. This information is also very useful for fighting. It works. Sometimes the accuracy of this kind of wartime intelligence may even directly affect the outcome of a battle.

The Blood Killer Sect has radar, so they didn’t pay much attention to wartime intelligence in the past, but when they were fighting the Hai Clan, they discovered that radar sometimes loses its effectiveness, just like dealing with underground enemies, radar It's a little bit beyond their capabilities. At this time, frontline intelligence personnel are very important.

And they may encounter various enemies in the future. If an enemy discovers their radar and cracks their radar, then their radar will be useless if they do not have this intelligence system. , then this situation is very dangerous for the Blood Killing Sect, so it is very necessary for the front line to have its own external intelligence system. The boss lady used to do intelligence, and her relationship with Zhao Hai is also Very good, so there is absolutely no problem in letting her be responsible for frontline intelligence.
