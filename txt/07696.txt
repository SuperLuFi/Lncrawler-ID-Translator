Gu Yuanzheng, who was standing next to Bai Yan, couldn't help but be stunned when he heard what Bai Yan said. Then he said with some confusion: "Buddha nature? If those monsters really have Buddha beasts, will they have no intention of war? If that’s the case, can we take over the Heaven and Human Realm without fighting?”

Bai Yan opened his eyes, shook his head, then looked at the endless forest, and said: "It won't be that easy. If I guessed correctly, there should be countless monsters in this forest. And every monster has its own territory. We should have entered the territory of four tiger monsters now, so those tiger monsters roar angrily, so regardless of whether they have Buddha nature or not, they will attack us. , will not let us go."

"Huh, come on. Are we still afraid of him? I really want to see how powerful the monsters here are." Gu Yuanzheng is not a good-tempered person, so he doesn't agree with what Bai Yan said. He doesn't really care. In his opinion, if there are enemies blocking their way forward, they can just destroy them. There is nothing to worry about.

Bai Yan smiled slightly and said in a deep voice: "That's right. If there are enemies, we can just eliminate them. Let's see what kind of enemies we will encounter this time." Although Bai Yan is also very careful about the people here in the heaven and human world, But to say that he is really worried about the threat that the people here in the Heavenly Realm will pose to them, that's really not the case. He really is not worried at all about this aspect.

As soon as he finished speaking, he heard a staff officer coming to Bai Yan's side and said to Bai Yan: "Elder, there is a disappearance from the front line. Please turn the screen to No. 13." This time, Zong Bu was killed with blood. They just used radar, and also asked the Kirigakure clan and the Alien clan to go to reconnaissance, so they could also feed back some projections, so the projections in front of Byakugan are now divided into many numbers, so that he can adjust them at any time. Different projections.

Bai Yan nodded, and then a moment later, he directly turned on projection No. 13. When Projection No. 13 was enlarged, the other projections would automatically shrink. This is a newly added function on the radar ship, and Bai Yan Now, he was completely stunned by the situation on the Thirty Thirty projection.

The reason why he was in a daze was because what appeared on Projection No. 13 surprised him. He did not expect that what appeared on Projection No. 13 would actually be a temple, and it was a very big temple. This temple covers a large area and has about ten miles of seats. There are various pavilions and pavilions inside. In the innermost part of the temple, there is a big Buddha. This big Buddha is probably several hundred meters high. He is sitting cross-legged on the lotus platform, with a majestic appearance that makes people have the urge to kneel down and worship him at the first sight. It is really surprising.

In front of this temple, there is a large square. On this square, there are many monks standing. They are all wearing gray robes, all of them are bald, and they all have weapons in their hands. , the leader is a tall old monk with a big beard. This old monk is holding a huge Zen staff in his hand. The appearance of this Zen staff is very special, it is as thick as a goose egg. The staff's head looks like a tiger's head, but it is a tiger-head Zen staff.

And the old monk waved the tiger-headed Zen staff from time to time, and every time he waved the tiger-headed Zen staff, there would be a huge tiger roar. When he saw this, his eyes were really stunned. He did not expect that the sound of the tiger's roar came from the tiger-head Zen staff, and that there would be a monk here.

He took a closer look at the weapons in the hands of these monks. There were not many types of weapons in the hands of these monks. There were only two types, one was the eyebrow-leveling stick, and the other was the Jie Dao. They were all held in one hand. He was holding a weapon, but his other hand was firmly on his chest, his head lowered, and he was chanting scriptures in his mouth, looking extremely solemn.

Seeing this situation, Bai Yan's brows completely wrinkled, and he said in a deep voice: "Monks? And why do I feel that the breath on their bodies seems to be living people? If they are real monks, then how can they Will they appear here? Could it be that they are monks from the Temple of the Emerald Buddha? When the Temple of the Emerald Buddha was destroyed, before the Temple of the Emerald Buddha was destroyed, the abbot of the Temple of the Emerald Buddha sent some Buddhists from their temple here? No, These monks don’t look very old, it’s been many years since the Emerald Buddha Temple was destroyed, so even if they are monks from the Emerald Buddha Temple, they can’t be so young, right?”

Not only rolled their eyes, but even Gu Yuanzheng and the others also frowned. These monks were really difficult to deal with. You must know that the Blood Killing Sect has always had a good impression of Buddhism, especially the people of the Jade Buddha Temple. The Dharma practiced in the Buddhist temple is different from the Dharma practiced by other Buddhist sects in the world of cultivation. It is very similar to the Dharma practiced by the disciples of the Blood Killing Sect. It is precisely because of this that the disciples of the Blood Killing Sect have a deep respect for Jade. The people in the Buddhist temple are still very fond of me.

It is precisely because of this that when they see these monks, their faces suddenly become ugly. They suddenly feel that something is wrong. If these people are really from the Jade Buddha Temple, then directly Just attacking them, there's really something wrong with that.

When he thought of this, Bai Yan immediately contacted Wen Wenhai directly. After Wen Wenhai connected to the communication circle, Bai Yan immediately told him the situation here. When Wen Wenhai heard what Bai Yan said, he was also stunned, and then he immediately He said, "Wait a minute, I'll be here right away." After saying that, he immediately broke off the magic circle, and the next moment he appeared in the radar ship.

As soon as Bai Yan saw Wen Wenhai, he immediately went up to him. Wen Wenhai nodded, glanced at him, and said in a deep voice: "What on earth is going on? Did you really find a monk here?" He was concerned about this matter. He was also very surprised, and what he thought was the same as what Bai Yan thought. If monks were really found here, those monks were probably from the Jade Buddha Temple, so it seemed a little weird that they were killing these monks. It was appropriate, that's why he rushed over in such a hurry.

Bai Yan immediately led Wen Wenhai to the magic circle and said to Wen Wenhai: "Old Wen, you see for yourself, these monks feel a little strange. They do have the breath of life on their bodies. They are not completely illusions. Are they real or not?" Phantoms, our radar can now distinguish them, these people have a very strong aura of life."

Wen Wenhai took a careful look at the radar, then nodded and said: "It is indeed the breath of life, but what is going on? Why do monks appear here? Is it really the time when the Jade Buddha Temple was destroyed? A Buddhist who escaped here? But is this possible?"

Baiyan shook his head and said: "It's really hard to say. It's possible. Now I'm worried about this. If they really belong to the Jade Buddha Temple, should we kill them? The sect leader said before However, the Buddhism practiced by these people at the Emerald Buddha Temple has many similarities with the Buddhism practiced by our Blood Killing Sect. Does that mean that they actually have a certain relationship with us? At least they are related to us. The sect master has a certain relationship, so I think it is best for us to report this matter to the sect master and let the sect master make a decision."

Wen Wenhai nodded, and then he immediately contacted Zhao Hai. As soon as the magic circle was connected, he immediately said to Zhao Hai: "Ju'er, there are some situations happening on the front line. I think you'd better come and take a look. "Wen Wenhai really didn't dare to make the decision in this matter, so he said this.

When Wen Wenhai said this, Zhao Hai was also stunned. At first, he really didn't pay attention to the things on the front line. In fact, he is also studying those Buddhist magic circles now, so he really doesn't care about the things on the front line. He didn't pay attention, but when he heard Wen Wenhai say this, he couldn't help but froze, and then immediately said: "Okay, I'll be there soon." After saying that, he moved, and the next moment he had appeared in the radar ship.

As soon as Zhao Haigang arrived in the radar ship, everyone in the radar ship saluted him. Zhao Hai waved his hand, then glanced at Wen Wenhai and the others, and then said in a deep voice: "Tell me, what is going on? "Zhao Hai is really very curious as to what happened to make Wen Wenhai and the others react like this.

Wen Wenhai immediately said: "Boss, it's like this. There are a lot of living people in front of you. They are real living people, and they are all monks. We now suspect that these monks may be people from the Jade Buddha Temple." , if they are really from the Temple of the Emerald Buddha, then do we still have to deal with them?"

When Zhao Hai heard what Wen Wenhai said, he was stunned. Then he quickly came to the radar projection, took a look at the projection, and then couldn't help but raise his brows slightly, and then said in a deep voice: "It's really a living person. , interesting, ordered the army to stop advancing, not to attack yet, I went to take a look, contact them and said, if they are really from the Emerald Buddha Temple, let's see if they will surrender. If they don't surrender, That’s saying something.”

Wen Wenhai and the others all responded, but Wen Wenhai still said: "Boss, let Lao Ding and the others accompany you. You can't do anything by yourself." Wen Wenhai was really worried about Zhao Hai, Zhao Hai is the most important person in the entire Blood Killing Sect. If something happens to him, it will be really troublesome.

When Zhao Hai heard what he said, he was stunned for a moment, then smiled slightly and said: "Okay, let Lao Ding and the others follow me and let them prepare." Zhao Hai also knew that Wen Wenhai did mean what he said. Yes, there were some things that did not require him to come forward in person, so he agreed to Wen Wenhai.

Wen Wenhai was overjoyed and responded quickly, then immediately notified Ding Chunming and the others in person. Soon Ding Chunming, Sheng Si, Cheng Wanchun, and Gouzi had arrived at the radar ship. As soon as they saw Zhao Hai, They immediately stepped forward to salute Zhao Hai, and at the same time, they all had a look of excitement on their faces.

These people actually have the title of Zhao Hai's guards, but they have almost never had the chance to protect Zhao Hai, and Zhao Hai does not need them to protect him, so they have always been regarded as the fighting force of the Blood Killing Sect. The strongest group is using it, and now they can finally protect Zhao Hai. How can they not be excited?
