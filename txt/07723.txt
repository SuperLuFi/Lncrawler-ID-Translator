He rolled his eyes and said with a smile: "This is not a problem at all. In fact, it is easy to solve. We can group several branches into a group, and we can change such groups from time to time. Even the disciples in the branch can be changed at any time. Just do the swap and there won't be any problems."

Chang Jun said in a deep voice: "Training alone is not enough. We can conduct competitions. If the competition results are better, we can give some rewards to groups or branches. The rewards do not need to be too heavy, but they can arouse their desire to win. In this way Only then will you really have a sense of competition, what do you think?"

Everyone else nodded, but at this time Zhu Yong said: "I think we can also hold competitions in other aspects, such as competitions within the Shenji Hall, various majors, We can hold a competition internally, and maybe the effect will be better."

Wen Wenhai nodded. What Zhu Yong said was very reasonable. Branch halls like Shenji Hall, Spiritual Beast Hall, and Lingzhi Hall are not focused on fighting. Each of them has its own characteristics. , allowing them to participate in the battle is actually a waste of their abilities. They should be placed in a position that is more suitable for them, so that they can play their greatest role, and this is what Wen Wenhai and the others want.

Wen Wenhai glanced at everyone, and then said: "Do you have any opinions on this arrangement? If you don't have any opinions, then we will carry out this plan. Although this plan sounds simple now, what kind of training will be carried out? , what kind of rewards will be distributed, how people from each branch will be allocated together, and how to conduct competitions all need to be prepared, so even if we pass this decision, there are still many things to prepare for, and there will not be much time to waste. , If you have any objections, please speak out directly and tell us the reasons for your objections."

Everyone was silent for a while. Emperor Shitian and others who attended such a meeting for the first time were very surprised. They did not expect that the Blood Killing Sect would handle things in this way. Zhao Hai issued an order and the people below were responsible for going there. Do it, and judging from their appearance, Zhao Hai doesn't care what they do, he only cares about the results.

He really suffered from this kind of management method, and the method proposed by the Blood Killing Sect was something they had never thought of before. In fact, if there were no resources like the Blood Killing Sect, such a method would not be possible. It worked, so what really surprised Emperor Shitian was the ability of the Blood Killing Sect.

When Wen Wenhai saw that no one objected, he continued: "Okay, as long as no one objects, let's discuss how to conduct confrontation training. Confrontation training is based on training that is closest to actual combat. All disciples who die during confrontation training will be banned from participating in the next three rounds of confrontation training, what do you think?"

Everyone nodded, rolled their eyes and said solemnly: "In the past, our confrontation training was just targeted training, such as specialized close combat training, or battle formation training. I don't think this is possible. If we want To truly achieve it and get closer to actual combat, there should be no restrictions. You can even provide them with some weapons like Mantianzhi, and at the same time, things like Plant Master, Formation Master, and Blood Killing Battle Fort can also be provided. It can be provided to them, and there is no guarantee that we will not encounter powerful enemies in the future, so we must train in advance."

Upon hearing what Bai Yan said, Wen Wenhai and the others were stunned for a moment, and then continued: "Okay, it can be done, and it must be done in various environments, such as in the sea, or in spaces where the magic circle cannot be used, or where it cannot be done. The flying space, etc., must be trained in various environments. Only in this way can we truly let those disciples experience what actual combat is."

Everyone nodded. Wen Wenhai's suggestion was actually very good. This is how actual combat training should be conducted. Otherwise, it cannot be called actual combat training. After all, they have already experienced several different situations in the Tianlong Babu Realm. The environment, some environments caused them to suffer a lot, so it is very meaningful for them to conduct such practical training.

Chang Jun said in a deep voice: "You can let Lao Ding and the others join in, and let those disciples learn how to face the masters. Only when they can save their lives when facing those masters, can they be considered to be true early." They have passed the test, I think after such arduous training, there won’t be any barriers between them, right?”

Everyone nodded. They all believed that after such training, there would be no problems between the disciples. After all, they shared the same sorrow. If under such circumstances, there would still be problems between them. Problem, then there really is nothing anyone can do.

The matter was settled like this, and then Wen Wenhai and the others discussed the details, and then Wen Wenhai gave the leader a task, asking their staff to prepare a detailed confrontation plan based on their opinions. The training plan is out. After all, the staff department is an expert in this area.

After the meeting was over, Di Shitian, Hu An and the others returned to the Jade Buddha Temple. This Jade Buddha Temple was not the Jade Buddha Temple in the Heavenly World. It was the Jade Buddha Temple newly built for Emperor Shitian by the Blood Killing Sect. The temple looks almost exactly the same as the Jade Buddha Temple in the Tianren Realm.

Following Emperor Shitian were Hu An, Hu Jing, Hu Xiang and Hu He. The four of them were not cabinet members of the Blood Killing Sect, but they were substitute members of the cabinet and were qualified to participate in this meeting, so They had been following Emperor Shitian during the meeting, so they naturally knew the content of today's meeting.

After the five people sat down, Emperor Shitian looked at Hu An and the four of them and said, "What do you think of today's two meetings? Come on, tell us." To be honest, for today's two meetings, what do you think? Di Shitian still had a lot of feelings from these two meetings, but he still wanted to hear what Hu An and the others had to say.

Hu An was silent for a while, and then he said: "Holy Lord, the disciples still have a lot of feelings about the two meetings of the Blood Killing Sect today, and these days, the disciples have also gained some understanding of the Blood Killing Sect. The Killing Sect can actually be divided into two parts. One part is the disciples of the Blood Killing Sect. This part includes most of the Blood Killing Sect disciples, and also includes branches such as the Shenji Hall and the Spiritual Beast Hall. This part is actually the real part. The managers are Elder Wen Wenhai and the others, and they are now members of the cabinet headed by them. This can also be said to be the main part of the Blood Killing Sect, while the other part is the logistics department."

Speaking of this, Hu An paused for a moment, and then said: "The logistics department of the Blood Killing Sect is almost completely independent. Elder Wen Wenhai and the others have no control over the logistics department, and the people in the logistics department are also very independent. Have less contact with other disciples. In fact, the Blood Killing Sect’s logistics department has a very small number of people, and the managers there are several wives of the sect leader.”

"The sect master's wives are not only powerful, but also have very strong management skills, and are even better at commanding troops. However, these years, with Elder Wen Wenhai and the others here, these ladies have not paid much attention to the matter of the Blood Killing Sect. , This may also be the intention of the sect master, otherwise, even if a few ladies manage the affairs of the Blood Killing Sect, there will definitely be no problems."

"The supreme ruler of the Blood Killing Sect is, of course, the Sect Leader. The Sect Leader is not only the ruler and founder of the Blood Killing Sect, he is also the God of the Blood Killing Sect, the only true god of the Blood Killing Sect. In the Blood Killing Sect, every person An elder can actually collect some power of faith. We also checked this time, because the Blood Killing Sect actually has believers, but their believers are different. Their believers also have their own lives. Yes, you can even practice. As long as you are strong enough, you can become a disciple of the Blood Killing Sect."

"I said Xinnu, Holy Lord, you may not know it well. I heard that Xinnu is a product of the lower world. People in the lower world have learned to use the power of faith. In order to get more power of faith, various sects in the lower world The door will raise faith slaves. These faith slaves are kept in a very closed space. What they have to do every day is to pray to the statue of the god to provide the owner of the statue with the power of faith. And these faith slaves are The people who were rescued by the Blood Killing Sect settled these believers and asked them to provide the power of faith to the elders who had been killed by the Blood. However, the lives of these believers are much better. Not only can they If you practice, you can also have a very good living environment."

"These believer slaves are also managed by several ladies. These are not important. What is important is that although the first elder will receive the power of faith, these elders provide the sect leader with the power of faith. This is not requested by the sect master, but the elders voluntarily regard the sect master as a god. In fact, in the Xuanwu space, the sect master is a god, because this Xuanwu space is made by the sect master, and the laws in the Xuanwu space are The power was also created by the sect leader, so the sect leader is a god here."

"The sect master can make all the people living in the Xuanwu space live forever, and in turn, the people in the Xuanwu space can provide the power of faith and other support to support the sect master's progress. As long as the sect master keeps moving forward, It will lead the entire people in the Xuanwu Space forward, and the people in the Xuanwu Space will be equivalent to immortality. Although it has been said before, the reality is almost like this, so the sect leader is in the Xuanwu Space, The one true God.”

"Following the sect master, we can ascend, keep ascending, and even gain immortality. Therefore, in the Blood Killing Sect, all the disciples regard the sect master as a god. This is not only because the sect is strong, but also because the sect master can carry Their ascension is also due to the contribution of the sect master. Without the sect master, there would be no Blood Killing Sect, and without the Blood Killing Sect, there would be no them. Maybe they had died somewhere long ago, and there would be no chance of ascension or immortality at all. Because of this, the disciples of the Blood Killing Sect all worship the sect master very much, so the sect leader is always aloof. What he says is the will of God in the Blood Killing Sect. No one dares to violate it. If anyone dares not to listen, countless disciples will kill him without the sect master taking action, and the first one to do so perfectly embodies this point."
