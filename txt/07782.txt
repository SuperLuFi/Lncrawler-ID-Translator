Because these iron cables are too huge, and after so many years, in order to facilitate walking, these iron cables have been covered with a layer of wooden boards, so they look like wooden bridges. Next to Tian Xuanzi and Jiu Jie are the beasts suppressed by the iron rope.

This beast is a big iron bull, three iron ropes, and three big iron bulls. These iron bulls are really huge. Tie Gao's height reaches about a hundred meters, and his length reaches an astonishing three hundred meters. The head of the iron bull is facing the direction of the iron rope, and there are two long and thick huge horns. One end of the iron chain is wrapped around the horns. The huge iron bull is coupled with a thick iron chain. , which makes the iron rope appear extremely strong.

Tian Xuanzi glanced at the iron rope, then thought about it, and then said: "Elder Jiujie, I think this is it. We walk to half of the iron rope, and then cut the iron rope until there is only a little bit left, and then retreat. When I come back, I'll break the iron rope, and finally cut off this end of the iron rope. As for the iron ox, let's just put it here. After all, it's too heavy, what do you think?"

Jiujie originally just wanted to cut off the iron rope directly, but now after hearing what Tian Xuanzi said, he felt that it made sense to do so, so that even if the people of the Shadow Clan wanted to repair the iron rope, they could It would take longer, so he nodded and said, "Okay, let's do it."

Tian Xuanzi nodded, and with a movement of his body, he climbed directly onto an iron rope. He swayed and disappeared from the place. Jiujie glanced at the direction where Tian Xuanzi disappeared, and did not say anything. As soon as he moved, he climbed directly onto another iron rope, and then his body swayed and disappeared on the iron rope.

Soon the two of them reached the middle of the iron rope. They glanced at the middle of the iron rope, and then they all started to move. They saw Tian Xuanzi raise the whisk in his hand, and then swung it towards the iron rope. Although the fly whisk seemed soft, in Tian Xuanzi's hands, it seemed to suddenly turn into a strange-shaped sword. With one slash of the sword, the wooden board was completely broken, and the iron chain under the wooden board was also broken. There was a click.

But the iron chain was not broken, only a sword mark appeared. Tian Xuanzi was stunned. He did not expect that his blow only left a sword mark on the iron chain. This really made him feel Very surprised, he is still very confident in his own strength, and don't forget his nickname, his name is Qingtian Yiqi Sword.

People say that there is only a wrong name, not a wrong nickname. The word sword in his nickname means that his sword is very powerful. With his current strength, does he have a sword in his hand? In fact, it is no longer important. He can do it completely. There is no sword in his hand, but there is a sword in his heart. Everything can be a sword, not to mention the whisk in his hand, which is also a magic weapon. In this case When he struck down with his sword, he could only leave a sword mark on the iron chain, but could not completely cut off the iron chain. This has shown how strong the iron chain is. It is really terrifying. .

However, although Tianjizi was stunned for a moment, he didn't say anything. He knew very well that the iron chain must be very strong, otherwise it would not be able to block the turbulent flow of energy. When he thought of this, he immediately flicked the dust He went down and hit the previous sword mark very accurately, which made the sword mark a little deeper.

Tianjizi didn't stop, and he slashed the iron bar on one side of the iron ring with his sword a few times. , until the iron bars were only slightly connected, he stopped. Then he moved and retreated directly towards the Sword of the Abyss.

After he returned to the Sword of the Abyss, he directly put his hand on the iron rope, and then exerted his strength, and the iron lock immediately began to shake. After the iron lock shook a few times, a click was heard. There was a loud noise, and then the iron rope broke directly. With a loud bang, the iron rope hit the mountain wall below the Sword of the Abyss.

Seeing that the iron rope was broken, Tian Jizi didn't say anything. He moved directly to the other iron rope. He moved a few times and reached the middle of the iron rope. Then he moved the iron rope. It was cut off. When he returned to the Sword of the Abyss, he found that Jiujie had cut off the iron rope he was responsible for and the iron rope Tianjizi was responsible for. They were all cut off by Tieniu. The horns are cut off.

Tian Jizi didn't say anything, and directly broke the last iron rope. Then with a movement of his body, he appeared at the horns of the bull. After a few more blows, he cut off the iron rope directly. In this way, three All the iron ropes leading to the Shadow Clan were broken, and half of the iron ropes fell directly into the endless abyss. It was impossible for the Shadow Clan people to repair the iron ropes even if they wanted to.

Then the two of them came to the east of the Sword of the Abyss, where there were two iron ropes leading to the Wanshan Realm. The two looked at each other, then moved, and each of them chose an iron rope, directly in front of Tieniu. At the horns, the iron rope was cut off, leaving only a little bit connected. Then he followed the iron rope and quickly returned to the Wanshan Realm. When he arrived at the Wanshan Realm, he saw Tieduo and the others, standing on the edge of the endless abyss. They didn't say anything when they were waiting for them, they just took action and broke the chains.

After breaking the iron chain, the two went to the horns and cut off the iron chain. The two iron chains fell directly into the endless abyss. They originally wanted to take back these two iron chains. After all, the refining materials of these two iron chains were also very good, and they would still be of some use after taking them back.

But when they thought about the weight of these two iron ropes, and when they thought that these iron ropes had already been refined and that there was a magic circle inside, it would be very difficult to refine them again, so they gave up. , just cut off the iron lock directly, there is no need to take it back.

After the two iron ropes were cut off, everyone let out a sigh of relief. Tianjizi turned his head and glanced at everyone, and then said in a deep voice: "Your sects are all on the edge of the endless abyss, far away from the endless abyss. Itâ€™s not far away. You should pay more attention to the situation here in the future, especially Tie Tuo. You should pay more attention to the situation at the Sword of the Abyss. If there is any change there, you must tell us immediately. do you understand?"

Tieduo responded, and then Tianjizi turned to look at Jiujie. Jiujie glanced at everyone and said in a deep voice: "We have solved the matter here for the time being, but you must also be careful and never relax. , the Shadow Clan people may have taken action now, so in the future, not only here, but also other iron ropes, we must pay attention and be more vigilant."

Everyone responded, and Jiujie turned to Tianjizi and said, "Master Tianjizi, I have nothing more to say. If there is nothing else, the poor monk will leave." Jiujie felt that here The matter has been dealt with. There is really no need for him to stay here anymore, so he wants to leave immediately.

Tian Jizi thought about it and found that nothing happened, so he nodded and turned to everyone: "Okay, nothing happens. Let's stop here today. Everyone, here in the Endless Abyss." I'll leave the matter to you. You can be said to be our first line of defense in the Wanshan Realm. You must pay more attention and say goodbye." After saying that, he gave everyone a fist.

Everyone hurriedly returned the salute, and then Tianjizi's body flashed with white light and disappeared. The same happened with Jiujie. He also saluted everyone, and then he also flashed with white light and disappeared directly. After the two of them left, the remaining Tie Tuo and the others looked at each other, but no one spoke. Finally, Tie Tuo said in a deep voice: "Everyone, farewell." After saying that, he gave everyone a fist in the air, He also disappeared in a flash of white light.

Although Tie Tuo and others are acting together today, their usual relationship is not very good. It can even be said that many of them are still enemies. The reason why they are acting together now is simply because of Tianjizi and Jiujie. , now that Tianjizi and Jiujie have left, there is naturally nothing to say between them, so Tie Tuo said goodbye and left directly. Others also left one after another. For a while, the place fell into silence. among.

Not long after Tieduo and the others left, several monks came to the side of the two iron bulls. Some of these monks were dressed as casual cultivators, while others were dressed as disciples of other sects. They were all different, but the leader was a tall monk with dark skin. He could tell at a glance that he was from the Xuanjia Sect.

The person from the Xuanjia Sect glanced at the severed iron chains on the two iron bulls and said solemnly: "This time, people from the Tianxuan Sect and Lei Zhangchan Temple all came, but just to destroy these two iron bulls." There must be something weird in this iron rope, and the news about this matter must be sent back as soon as possible to prevent people from Wanshan Realm from having any conspiracy."

Several other people also responded, and then another person said: "Elder Sun, I feel that something is wrong with this matter. I heard a news before that people in Wanshan Realm have completely They returned from the Black and White Battlefield, saying that the Black and White Battlefield was occupied by our Shadow Clan. Do you think they did this because of this incident?"

When Elder Sun heard what the man said, he was slightly startled, and then said in a deep voice: "This matter is indeed possible. They thought that the Black and White Battlefield was occupied by us, and they were afraid that we would come from the Sword of the Abyss. , directly attack the Wanshan Realm, so directly cut off the iron rope here, leaving us with no choice, it is very possible to attack the Wanshan Realm from here."

The monk who spoke before nodded and said: "Yes, I think so too, Elder Sun, what if this is really the case? Then won't our Shadow Clan's plan be in vain? Should we Think of a way?" He is obviously a monk, but he keeps talking about our Shadow Clan. It is obvious that he has already regarded himself as a Shadow Clan instead of a monk. This is really frustrating. People were very surprised.
