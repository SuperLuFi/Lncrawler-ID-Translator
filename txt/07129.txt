Watching the two people leave, Zhao Hai couldn't help but shook his head and sighed. He really didn't expect that the two people would react like this. Judging from their looks, they seemed to be afraid of losing their mission as scouts, and they didn't know What do you think, but Zhao Hai doesn't want to deal with so many people now. They perform better like this, so just let them go.

Laura also walked out at this time and said with a smile: "I said you don't have to worry. The alien race itself is a warlike race. Danger is nothing to them. Only fighting is the most suitable for them. Didn't you see When you didn't arrange this task for them before, Shun Li and Cang Ming were a little silent. You see how energetic they are now. That's because they like their current life, so you don't have to worry."

Zhao Hai nodded, and then said with a smile: "It's just because of Bai Suzhen's incident that I felt a little emotional in my heart. Their performance is naturally the best. By the way, what are Wen Wenhai and the others busy with now? Are you busy expanding again?" Zhao Hai almost guessed what Wen Wenhai and the others were busy with, and he just wanted to make sure by asking Laura.

Laura smiled and said: "Yes, they are busy expanding now. After this expansion, the scope of the Shadow Clan's law power is already very small, covering an area of ​​only about ten thousand miles. I'm afraid it will continue to expand." This is the final battle in the Snake World, but they don’t know what kind of enemy they will face this time, so they are all a little nervous.”

Zhao Hai smiled slightly, and then said in a deep voice: "You should also know that the great master of Wanshan Realm did not know where he knew some of the myths and legends on the earth. Among the myths and legends, there are many It’s about snake legends, but this time even the Legend of the White Snake is out, I really don’t know what will appear next.”

Laura nodded and said: "Yes, I don't know what will appear next. Maybe it is another familiar figure to us, but if we want to find someone stronger than them, I'm afraid there are not many. Really I want to know earlier, this is the last level in the snake world, what powerful characters will appear."

Zhao Hai smiled slightly. He was also very curious and really wanted to know what kind of people would be in this final stage of the snake world. In fact, it's not just him who is thinking about it, Wen Wenhai and the others are thinking about it even more. Wen Wenhai and the others are now gathered in the conference room of the Blood Slaughter Sect base, discussing this matter.

Wen Wenhai looked at the few people and said in a deep voice: "There is not much area left in the Snake World, so maybe our next battle will be the last one. Do you have any opinions on this matter? "Wen Wenhai really wants to listen to everyone's opinions, because he really doesn't have any confidence in his heart right now.

Chang Jun said: "In this last battle, I think the possibility of a large army fighting is not very high, because the enemy currently only occupies such a large area. If they really engage in a large army fighting with us, they will suffer a loss. It is definitely them, and it was the same last time at the sonic interface. The last ones to fight were not the armies. It should be the same this time. I am afraid that in the last battle, it will be the sect master who takes action again, and we can't solve it."

As soon as they heard what he said, everyone was silent for a while, and Shi Jin and the others looked even less good-looking. You must know that they are all from the Wanshan Realm. Originally, they thought that they would be the most powerful ones in the Blood Killing Sect. A group of strong people, but they did not expect that the strongest person in the Blood Killing Sect now is Zhao Hai, and they have seen all the previous battles. To be honest, they are really not sure that they can defeat those people. Among the enemies, only Zhao Hai can do it, so how can their faces look good?

However, other people did not think so. They had long been accustomed to the fact that Zhao Hai was the strongest being in the Blood Killing Sect, so their reaction was not as big as Shi Jin's, but this does not mean that How can their faces look good? There are tens of billions of people in the Blood Killing Sect. When they finally faced the enemy, it was Zhao Hai who came forward. This makes their faces look good.

Wen Wenhai's face didn't look good either, but he wasn't angry either. He knew what Chang Jun said was true, so he took a deep breath and said in a deep voice: "Old Chang is right, this possibility is the highest. , but we must be prepared, and we must not have any surprises. If the enemy really shows up with a large army, we can immediately enter the battle."

Everyone agreed, and then Wen Wenhai continued: "This incident also reminds us that we people are still far behind the real masters, and we must not relax at all. In the future, we can't let the sect leader come forward if we encounter any trouble. If this is really the case, then what use is there for us? I have never heard that that sect is like us. Whenever something goes wrong, the sect leader will be the one to deal with it. Come forward, do you think those of us are just living for a living? But now our strength is really not enough, so we must work hard to make ourselves stronger as soon as possible."

Everyone responded with a roar, this time the sound was louder than ever before. Wen Wenhai glanced at everyone, waved his hands and said: "Okay, everyone is going to get ready. Take down the Snake World. We should There is a period of rest, and everyone can use this period of time to summarize and make themselves stronger, but that is after this battle. After everyone goes back, they still have to be ready to fight. of."

Everyone agreed, then gave Wen Wenhai a fist, turned around and left. Wen Wenhai waited until everyone left, then turned to Chang Jun and sighed: "In the end, it is up to the boss to solve the problem, you Do you think we are too useless?" Wen Wenhai really felt this way, so he said this.

Chang Jun smiled and said: "You don't even look at how long we have been ascending. Can our training speed be compared with the sect master? If our training speed can really be the same as the sect master, then what do you think? Will the Blood Killing Sect still exist? Now everyone in the Blood Killing Sect worships the sect leader very much. If their strength can match that of the sect leader, I really don’t know if anyone will rise up to rebel against the sect leader.”

"They dare. If anyone dares to be disrespectful to the leader, I will kill every one of his heads." When Wen Wenhai heard what Chang Jun said, his eyebrows stood up. He had been following Zhao Hai for a long time, and he was very fond of Zhao Hai. Absolute loyalty, so when he heard Chang Jun speak like this, he immediately became angry. If someone really dared to be disrespectful to Zhao Hai, he would definitely kill him as soon as possible. There is absolutely no doubt about this. .

Chang Jun smiled and said: "Of course, if anyone dares to be disrespectful to the sect master, I will definitely kill him as soon as possible. I just said that, everything about our blood-killing sect disciples, almost It was all given by the sect master, how dare they disrespect the sect master. The training speed of those of us is probably not as fast as that of the sect master, so we can't be anxious, we can only do it slowly step by step. I believe we will definitely One day, he will become a master and help the sect master solve his problems."

Wen Wenhai nodded and said solemnly: "I also believe this. One day, we will definitely help the boss. That's all. It's useless if we don't talk about it now. Let's go prepare. The snakes we encountered all fought in groups. If the last piece of Shadow Clan's law power turned into snakes and attacked us, it would be equivalent to a big war, and we would need all the disciples of the Blood Sect. On the move."

Chang Jun nodded and said: "It is indeed necessary to guard against it. We cannot make empiricist mistakes. That would be very dangerous. I will make arrangements. Now that our expansion is almost over, it will be until our next attack. I believe it won’t take long, so it won’t hurt us to prepare earlier.”

Wen Wenhai said in a deep voice: "We must make sure that all the disciples cannot relax. The closer to the end, the more dangerous it is. After traveling a hundred miles, only half of it is ninety. We have passed the previous stages, but we fell at the last stage." Here, that is not what I want to see, and I believe that the boss will not want to see it either. The main test for the boss this time is our command ability. We cannot deal with too strong opponents, but if we can even command If we can't do it well, then we will be useless."

Chang Jun smiled and nodded: "Yes, we can't deal with enemies that are too strong now, but we must not have any problems with our command. I will make arrangements right away, and you should also be prepared." Wen Wenhai agreed. After a sound, Chang Jun hugged his fists, turned and left. The two of them were not together every day. Everyone had their own things to be busy with.

Under the attention of the senior leaders of the Blood Killing Sect, the slightly loose strings in the hearts of the Blood Killing Sect disciples suddenly collapsed. Everyone was preparing nervously, waiting for the end. With the arrival of the first battle, the atmosphere in the Blood Killing Sect has become unprecedentedly tense, even more tense than during the previous battles.

The Five Elements Ultimate Killing Dragon in the Five Elements Ultimate Killing Formation seemed to feel the tension of the Blood Killing Sect disciples. His swimming speed in the Five Elements Ultimate Killing Formation became faster, and even It also makes one or two dragon roars from time to time. You must know that this giant dragon is very powerful now. After the Blood Killing Sect's many expansions, the area of ​​their Five Elements Killing Formation has become larger and larger. , and the area of ​​the Five Elements Ultimate Formation is large, the Five Elements Ultimate Formation has naturally become more powerful, which also makes the giant dragon even more powerful. Now no one dares to underestimate this giant dragon. Dragon.

Zhao Hai was also watching the changes in the Blood Slaughter Sect in space. He was very satisfied with Wen Wenhai and the others' performance. Wen Wenhai and the others handled this matter very well. They still did not relax at the end, and He was fully prepared. Let's not talk about whether his preparation was useful. Such preparation alone made Zhao Hai feel happy. This was actually a sign of maturity.

Zhao Hai felt that letting Wen Wenhai and the others direct the attack on the Snake World this time was really the right choice. This decision really made Wen Wenhai and the others mature, and they could finally stop them alone. One side.
