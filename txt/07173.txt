c7173 Ready to fight

After half a month of upgrading, Zhao Hai called Wen Wenhai and the others to the main hall. After everyone arrived, Zhao Hai glanced at everyone and said with a smile: "Not bad, it seems that this time The upgrades have been completed well, then you can start your work. The second expansion is half a month late, so you have to work hard."

Wen Wenhai and the others didn't care at all, they all laughed. They also knew that Zhao Hai didn't mean to blame them at all. Wen Wenhai even smiled and said: "This time, for our Blood Killing Sect, That's a good thing. Now the disciples' enthusiasm for practice has increased a lot, but our expansion plan must also be carried out. The harassment of us by the yakshas these days has become much weaker. This means that they may They are already preparing to attack us."

The others all nodded. They had the same idea as Wen Wenhai. Not only did they want to attack the Yaksha clan, but the Yaksha clan would also attack them, because they were equal to invaders, and the former Lingkong commander did not If he dies, he will definitely want to take back his territory, so even if they don't attack the Yaksha clan, the Yaksha clan will attack them.

The Yasha clan had been attacking them before, but they were all small groups. An attack like this could only be regarded as harassment, because such an attack could not play a decisive role in the entire battle and could only delay them. Just stop them and slow down the Blood Killing Sect's actions. They did this to gain more time for the Yaksha clan. If the Yaksha clan wanted to attack the Blood Killing Sect, they would also need a certain amount of preparation time. When they were ready, they would naturally attack the Blood Killing Sect.

Now that their harassment has become smaller, this does not mean that the other party has given up attacking them. That is absolutely impossible. They will still attack, but they feel that they are almost ready to attack the Blood Killing Sect. Attacked, there is no need to engage in this kind of harassment war.

Zhao Hai didn't say anything, just nodded and looked at Wen Wenhai with a smile, which made Wen Wenhai more confident. He then said: "But the enemy's attack may still be waiting for a few days. If they If we attack right away, I'm afraid the harassment will stop completely, and this gives us time to prepare, so we can attack them first."

Wen Wenhai looked at the crowd and said: "The first step is to strike first. We have almost prepared everything before. Although we have stopped these days, our previous preparations have not been in vain. As long as we organize everyone, I believe we can start right away." , so I can only give you two days. After two days, we will launch an attack first, but at the same time, we must also prepare a good defense. If the enemy attacks us within two days, we cannot be unprepared at all. "

After finishing speaking, Wen Wenhai turned to look at Zhao Hai, wanting to hear if Zhao Hai had any opinions. Everyone's eyes were also focused on Zhao Hai. Zhao Hai looked at them and said with a smile: "Yes, you have done a good job. I have read the plan for your second attack plan before. It is very good. The staff has made progress. I believe that after a few times, they will have more plans. Big progress, this is a good thing for our Blood Killing Sect, I will leave the attack to you, if you need anything, you can come to me directly and go get busy."

Wen Wenhai and the others all responded, then bowed to Zhao Hai, then turned and left. After they left, Zhao Hai returned to the space. Laura and the others' current strength improvement can be described as a thousand miles. In the space There are countless good things that can increase their strength. Now they don’t have to worry about the endurance of their meridians, so they will naturally make rapid progress. Zhao Hai calculated that with Laura and the others’ training speed, it won’t take long. In time, their strength will be similar to Wen Wenhai and the others, or even surpass Wen Wenhai and the others.

Laura and the others have more ascension interfaces than Wen Wenhai and the others. Although they do not rely on their own strength for each ascension, they still get the benefits of ascension. The potential of their bodies is actually very huge. , before, it was just because of the speed of practice that it has not been effectively developed, but with this method, their body's potential has been fully stimulated, so their speed has improved so much. quick.

Moreover, Laura and the others no longer need to sit there and practice every day. They just need to let the exercises run in their bodies by themselves. They can also do other things, which will not affect them at all. This method was not used before because this method must be controlled well, so it requires distraction. After all, their physical strength is not as good as Zhao Hai. If the meridians are not handled properly, the meridians will be damaged, which will be troublesome, so Laura and the others have not used this method before.

But now you don’t have to worry about the damage to the meridians. Just let the exercises run at full power. There is no need to worry about the meridians. This is actually simpler. You don’t need too much control, so the exercises can run on their own without too much effort. If you pay attention, they can do their own thing.

Just like now, Laura and the others are directing the Necromancer clan to prepare for the war. In the Blood Killing Sect, except for the Necromancer clan and Zhao Hai, no one else knows that when the Necromancer clan is taking action, The one who actually commanded them to fight was actually Laura, not the Ancient Expedition and the King of Hell who ordered them, but no one knew this.

Laura and the others are very happy now, and can command the undead clan to fight again, and a problem they have been worried about before has also been solved. What they were most worried about was their strength. Now this problem has been solved, as long as they are in the past After a period of time, I believe that their strength will become stronger, and even reach the level of Wen Wenhai and the others, then they will be completely relieved.

Looking at how busy Laura and the others were, Zhao Hai didn't say anything, just smiled. It wasn't that he liked to push things out and leave everything to Laura and the others, but that Laura and the others liked this so that they could exist. In the past, Laura and the others ascended with Zhao Hai, but because Zhao Hai had just ascended to the upper realm and did not have the ability to protect himself, they could only stay in the space, and Zhao Hai was busy outside. Things are going on, and I am afraid that others will discover the existence of the space, and I don’t feel comfortable entering the space. Although I can talk to Laura and the others, the opportunities for real meeting are very few.

In that case, Laura and the others will feel very lonely, and may even feel that their lives are meaningless and will only drag down Zhao Hai. Zhao Hai also discovered this later, so he gave Laura and the others Arrange things and leave all kinds of things to Laura and the others to keep them busy. They will not have such thoughts, otherwise it will be dangerous.

Zhao Hai is very clear that the laws in space have actually existed for a long time. People who enter the space, unless Zhao Hai agrees, can live forever. At least as long as Zhao Hai is alive, the people in the space will also be able to live forever. You can live, but the deaths of Merlin, Green, and the ghosts made Zhao Hai understand that it turns out that a person's death has nothing to do with his strength, or even the laws, but with his thoughts. Relatedly, people can choose to die. If their heart dies, then they will die, and it is a death that no one can save.

It is precisely because of this that Zhao Hai makes Laura and the others busy. He does not dare to let Laura and the others have the idea that life is meaningless and they have had enough, because once they have this idea, then They may be really in danger, or they may become inner demons. At that time, they will really be doomed, and even Zhao Hai may not be able to save them.

It is precisely because of this that Laura and the others like to do these things now. They have always been in charge of the logistics of the Blood Killing Sect, but the logistics of the Blood Killing Sect is really very simple. As long as the work is arranged, you don't have to worry too much. Now that we have an optical computer, management is more convenient, so Laura and the others still have a lot of free time every day.

But now because they have to practice, they will not have the idea that they have lived enough, but they still like to command the battle. They have always commanded the undead clan to fight in the past, and it is the same now. The spirit clan is like their toys. As for Zhao Hai, he is not really heartbroken by the death of the undead clan. His main concern is Laura and the others, so he will not object to Laura and the others at all. Not to mention that Laura and the others are actually very talented in commanding battle methods. As far as the current Blood Killing Sect is concerned, there are really few people who can match them, and it can even be said that there is no one. In this regard, Zhao Hai is not as good as them.

The reason why Zhao Hai doesn't want to care about these things is because he is actually the person in the Blood Killing Sect who needs training the most. Although his strength can be said to be the strongest in the Blood Killing Sect, he knows very well , his enemy is stronger, he is here now, the people of Shadow Clan may not be able to do anything to him, but what if he leaves from here? Once he reaches the Wanshan Realm, what if he takes the name of the Blood Killing Sect? Will the Shadow Clan ever let him go? Impossible, absolutely impossible. The Shadow Clan people will definitely not let him go. They will definitely come to deal with him. By then, he will have to face many masters. Maybe there will be someone from the Wanshan Realm. For a person in the upper world, if his strength is not enough at that time, he will be finished. As soon as he is finished, the Blood Killing Sect will be finished.

He doesn't want to die, he wants eternal life, he wants all the disciples in the Blood Killing Sect to be immortal and follow him to the end, so he must make himself stronger as soon as possible, and it is precisely because of this , so he doesn’t want to worry about too many things, he wants to practice, and he wants to make himself stronger.

And Zhao Hai's practice is not only about spiritual energy, but also about the law and the understanding of the Tao. When his strength has reached his level, the most important practice is the law and the understanding of the Tao. Accumulation comes second.
