After Old Liu Tou left, Zhao Hai let out a sigh of relief. From the current point of view, this matter seems to be a dead end, but it does not mean that there is no way to survive. But is this way of survival really feasible? What he said didn't count, they had to look at Hu Zhi's, so they could only wait now.

Then Zhao Hai also told Xiao Jiu about this matter. After hearing the whole story, Xiao Jiu really didn't know what to say. He was also very troubled by this matter. In his opinion, This matter is really a headache, and there seems to be no solution.

After such a mood, four days passed in a row. During this period, Zhao Hai cooked the iron-feathered bird, waiting for Hu Zhi and the others to drink the soup when they came back, but on the fourth day At night, Zhao Hai and the others had already rested. Suddenly there was a commotion in the town. Zhao Hai immediately sat up from the bed and rushed out of the room.

Xiaojiu also ran out of the room at this time. Zhao Hai said loudly to Xiaojiu: "Xiaojiu, look at the children. I'll go and see what's going on." After saying that, he moved and walked straight towards He walked outside the courtyard and disappeared in the blink of an eye, but Xiaojiu arrived directly at Zhao Hai's courtyard.

When Zhao Hai arrived at the main street of the town, he was shocked because he found that it was the people who collected the medicine who had returned, but these people now looked very embarrassed, and many of them had They were all injured, but what surprised Zhao Hai was that he didn't see Hu Zhi and Scarface.

Zhao Hai moved and fell directly in front of those people. Then he looked at a person from the Ancient Sword Gang. That man was an old man from the Ancient Sword Gang and was following Lanka's father. He looked at the man and said: "Broken Knife, what's going on? Why are you injured? Where's Brother Hu? Where's Scarface?"

Broken Knife is that man's nickname. He got a Broken Knife from an ancient battlefield and has always used that Broken Knife as a magical weapon, so he got such a name, and this Broken Knife is really a It was a very good magical weapon. It was very sharp and could release knives, so he kept using this magical weapon. He was considered a master among the Ancient Sword Gang.

When Duandao heard what Zhao Hai said, his expression turned very ugly. He said solemnly: "We encountered an attack. Brother Hu and Scarface were both killed!" When he said the last sentence, his The circles under his eyes were already red, and there was a look of extreme pain on his face.

When Zhao Hai heard what he said, he was stunned, and then said in a deep voice: "Impossible, how could Brother Hu die? How could Scarface die? Where are the corpses? Where are the corpses of the two of them?" Zhao Hai really There was no way to believe that Hu Zhi and Scarface would die. In his opinion, Hu Zhi and Scarface should not be attacked.

Broken Blade said in pain: "I couldn't get it back!" At this point, he couldn't say any more and started crying. However, his words made Zhao Hai freeze for once. He was really I couldn't believe that Hu Zhi and Scarface were both really dead, and he couldn't even get the bodies back.

Zhao Hai's face was ashen, and he said in a deep voice: "Stop howling, tell me, what happened, and who attacked you." Zhao Hai thought it was the hands of those who had transcended salvation again, but he had to To confirm, he didn't quite understand what those people who were saving people meant. Could it be that those people who were saving people were here to kill them, not to kill Lanka?

Duandao and the others were all frightened by Zhao Hai's loud shout. The scene suddenly became quiet. It took a while for Duandao to react. He glanced at Zhao Hai and said with a wry smile: "It's some Loose cultivators, but we don’t know who they are, those guys all have their faces covered, so we can’t see their faces clearly.”

Zhao Hai's face was still very ugly. He glanced at the others and found that almost everyone was injured, and some of them were seriously injured. He immediately shouted: "Everyone, go home and treat your injuries immediately." , Feihua, Di Ting, you two go on guard to prevent the enemy from following you and coming to the town, but we don’t know, Broken Blade, you follow me.”

Duandao and the others responded, and the two people named Feidao and Di Ting immediately responded and went out to guard. One of them was very fast, so they called Feihua, and the other People have very good ears, so when they are called, they are all nicknames. As for their original names, no one has called them by their original names for a long time.

Zhao Hai led Duandao and the others back to the yard, and found that Lanka and the others had all woken up. They were all gathered by Xiaojiu to Shizhang. Zhao Hai thought for a while and said in a deep voice: "Duandao, you guys first heal the wounds." Take care of it, Lanka, come with me, and go to the secret room to take shelter first." After saying that, Zhao Hai led Lanka and the other children to the woodshed, and then hit a magic formula on the ground. There was a person under the woodshed. There was a large secret room, which was actually prepared by Zhao Hai temporarily. He asked Lanka and the others to go to the secret room, and then restored the secret room to its original state. Then he took a look at Broken Blade and the others.

Everyone like Duandao and the others were injured. Except for Feihua and Di Ting, whose injuries were lighter, the injuries of the others were not minor. Two of them were seriously injured. They have gone to the hospital now. They went to rest, but Duandao and the others simply treated the wounds and gathered in the living room. They knew that Zhao Hai must have arranged something.

At this time, a sudden scream came. Duan Dao's expression changed and he immediately said, "It's the sound of Fei Hua. It seems that the enemy is coming." After saying that, he stood up directly and lifted up Duan Dao. The knife goes out. However, he was pulled back by Zhao Hai, and Duandao looked at Zhao Hai with some confusion.

Zhao Hai looked at his appearance and said in a deep voice: "Okay, I'll handle this matter. You guys can rest here first." After saying that, he moved out of the room and disappeared in a flash. Figure, but Broken Blade and the others were stunned there, but they reacted immediately and were about to chase after them, but they were held back by Xiao Jiu.

Duan Dao looked at Xiao Jiu with some confusion and said: "Xiao Jiu, why are you pulling me? Go and help Brother Ying. Those guys who are chasing us must be here. Those guys are not easy to mess with. We must go Help Brother Ying." Duandao still cares about Zhao Hai very much. He has also fought against those enemies. He knows that those enemies are very powerful. Zhao Hai may suffer in the past alone, so he wholeheartedly wants to help. .

Xiao Jiu said in a deep voice: "Let's wait here. Don't forget, Brother Ying has a Dharma." After saying that, he turned to look outside. In fact, he was worried that someone would come here and find Lanka. What he was worried about was not the casual cultivators, but the men in black. Compared to the casual cultivators, the men in black were the most troublesome existence.

At this time, Zhao Hai had already appeared on the main street of the town. He had already seen a group of people surrounding two people and attacking them non-stop. The two people surrounded were Feihua and Diting. . Zhao Hai snorted coldly, moved his body, and rushed over. While he was in mid-air, he shouted loudly: "You dare to come to our Linyuan Town to act wild. You really don't care about life and death. You must die!" Then he punched him directly.

Although those people heard Zhao Hai's voice, Zhao Hai's speed was too fast. Just when they heard Zhao Hai's voice, Zhao Hai's attack arrived, and he punched a man whose face was covered. On the chest of the casual cultivator, the casual cultivator was directly hit and flew out, and also knocked down another casual cultivator behind him. The two flew out at the same time, but after falling to the ground, they did not get up.

Zhao Hai then rushed towards another casual cultivator and punched him again. The man obviously reacted. The long knife in his hand stabbed Zhao Hai's throat. As for Zhao Hai's attack, His punch was indifferent. The sword was longer than his arm, so if the two of them attacked each other like this, his sword would definitely hit Zhao Hai's throat first. If Zhao Hai was smart, If he can definitely avoid the long knife, then Zhao Hai's punch will naturally resolve it.

Zhao Hai turned a blind eye to the long knife. His fist still struck forward, and his throat hit the long knife. However, he heard a click and the long knife was directly hit by his throat. It was broken by the impact, and his punch hit the man's chest squarely. The man's figure also flew out and hit a person behind him. After the two flew out, they fell There was no sound on the ground.

At this moment, there was a knife and a sword, attacking directly at Zhao Hai's back. The sword pierced Zhao Hai's back, and that knife was directed towards Zhao Hai's neck. Hai stood there without moving. Then he heard two clanging sounds, and one sword and one sword stabbed directly into his body. However, when the long sword struck Zhao Hai's neck, it seemed like it had struck the iron. On the top, a spark unexpectedly appeared, and after the long knife stabbed Zhao Hai, it bent directly into a bow shape. Fortunately, the sword looked good. The man stepped back and the sword recovered. As is.

But at this moment, Zhao Hai grabbed the casual cultivator who was using the sword, then turned around and threw the casual cultivator who was using the sword towards the casual cultivator who was using the sword. The sword cultivator was still retreating, unable to dodge at all. He quickly stretched out his hand to catch the sword cultivator.

Creak, creak, the sound of two bones breaking. The man who wielded the sword had both arms broken. Before he could scream, his whole body was hit by the casual cultivator who wielded the sword, and then there was a mouthful of blood. It spurted out, and then the two of them flew back and disappeared.

The people who attacked Feihua and Diting were no more than a dozen people in total, and six of them were dead now. When the people who got off the train saw this situation, they were all frightened, and one of them roared. , turned around and wanted to run away, but Zhao Hai did not give them this chance. He directly kicked the swords left by the dead casual cultivators on the ground towards those who escaped, and those swords directly turned into a line. The phantoms directly penetrated into the bodies of those people, and some swords even killed two people in a row. Then they flew far away, and then stuck into the ground or into the wall, and then stopped. But of those who attacked Feihua and Di Ting, none were left, and they were all dead.
