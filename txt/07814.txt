Lanka is a very smart child, otherwise he would not have been able to live for several months without anyone taking care of him, and he was living a good life, and could even eat meat from time to time, so he was learning to write. When he was young, he also learned very quickly and very seriously.

Lanka's father also taught him to read before, and others also taught him, so when he learned to read, he didn't actually feel too strange. Zhao Hai taught him very well, so Lanka learned it well. It was so good that time passed by without even realizing it.

An hour later, Zhao Hai also finished the day's reading practice. In this hour, Zhao Hai taught Lanka a lot of things. He not only taught Lanka how to read, but also taught Lanka a lot about himself. What you need to know is told in the form of some stories.

After finishing the reading teaching, Zhao Hai took out the contract he had made with Old Liu Tou, and then handed the contract to Ranka. Ranka held the contract and looked at it with some confusion. Zhao Hai, Zhao Hai smiled slightly, then moved his hand, and there was an extra bracelet in his hand. This bracelet was not very beautiful, it looked like a very ordinary silver chain, here in Wanshan Realm , many children will carry this thing, firstly for beauty, and secondly for safety. Zhao Hai was also here in Linyuan Town. He saw that the children here were wearing this thing, so he brought one.

But this bracelet of his is not just for good looks. It is a piece of space preparation. At the same time, this bracelet is also a defensive item. Zhao Hai put the bracelet on Lanka and then said to Lanka: "Lanka, please give me the bracelet." A trace of spiritual power has been input into it, so that this bracelet can recognize you as its master."

Although Ranka didn't know why, he still responded, and then input a trace of mental power into the bracelet. After the mental power was input into the bracelet, a light lit up slightly on the bracelet, and then disappeared, and the bracelet It's still a bracelet, it doesn't look any different.

However, Lanka's eyes lit up, because at the moment when the bracelet recognized its owner, he already knew the purpose of this bracelet. There is a large inner space in this bracelet. This inner space is the ordinary space preparation room. However, this same space is very huge, about 10,000 cubic meters, which is very huge and can hold a lot of things. It is much stronger than the space equipment he used before.

And he also has the ability to defend. As long as he needs it, this bracelet will protect him without even having to command him. Therefore, Lanka likes this bracelet very much. He immediately took out a bracelet. , took out all the things inside, and put them into the bracelet.

In fact, Lanka doesn't have many things. The most things in his hands are some things that his father left to him in the past, and some magic weapons. Those magic weapons are not high-end goods. They are all scattered by him. After repairing, he kept the things he robbed because the magic weapons were complete. Now it was the sword that his father left him. As for the sect token, he had never seen it at all. .

Zhao Hai watched Ranka put away all those things, then smiled slightly at Ranka and said: "Okay, put this away too." After saying that, he gave the contract to Ranka, Ranka had space. Zhao Hai had known about the equipment for a long time, and he had no intention of asking for Lanka's space equipment. It was his own thing, so what was he going to do?

Lanka looked at Zhao Hai with confusion, and then asked: "Master, what is this?" He really didn't know what it was. He didn't open the contract to read it. He took what the master gave him. , but he still had to ask. He was afraid that it was something particularly precious that he had accidentally damaged.

Zhao Hai smiled and said: "That is a contract, signed by your Grandpa Liu's grocery store on my street. I gave your Grandpa Liu a sum of spiritual stones and bought a stake in his grocery store. From now on, every month, you Grandpa Liu will give us two layers from his monthly income. I wrote your name on this contract. You should keep it well so that we can have it every month in the future. It’s a fixed income.”

People say that the children of the poor become rich early. During these few months without anyone taking care of them, Lanka already knew the importance of spiritual stones. He knew very well that if they had a fixed income every month, it would be very important to them. He said how important it is. With a fixed income, they don't have to go out and take risks. They have food to eat every day. This is really important to him.

So Lanka immediately opened the contract carefully and took a closer look. Although he didn't recognize some of the words on the contract, he still understood the general meaning. After reading it, he carefully read the contract again. After folding it, he handed it to Zhao Hai and said to Zhao Hai: "Master, this is too important, you should put it away."

Zhao Hai looked at Lan Ka's appearance and couldn't help but smile slightly and said: "No, just keep it. Once it's done, we're going out to train the little black demon." When Zhao Hai said this, Lan Ka Ka had no choice but to carefully put away the contract, and then followed Zhao Hai out of the yard.

The two of them soon arrived at the main street of Linyuan Town. As soon as they arrived on the main street, many people greeted Zhao Hai, and Zhao Hai returned the greeting with a smile, while Lanka also had a trace of tenacity on his little face. With a bright smile, he is really very happy, because starting from today, he will have a fixed income every month from now on, so he is very happy.

Zhao Hai looked at Lanka and smiled slightly. Without saying anything, he led Lanka and the little black demon out of the town. When they got outside the town, they walked not far and went directly into the woods next to them. Here, they came out to exercise, so naturally they couldn't stay on the avenue all the time. Not many monsters would appear there.

After entering the woods, Zhao Hai glanced around, turned to the little black demon and said: "Little black demon, go to the tree by yourself and see if you can find any monsters. Go ahead." The little black demon squeaked. He let out a cry, then jumped up and climbed directly onto the tree. After reaching the tree, he jumped up and disappeared.

Seeing that the little black demon disappeared, Ranka couldn't help but show a worried look on his face. Zhao Hai looked at Ranka's appearance and said with a smile: "Don't worry, the little black demon originally lived in the woods. In the woods, Here, nothing will happen to him. Let’s move forward slowly. Come on, let me test you. Tomorrow I will teach you about a lot of plants and see if you still remember this kind of thing. What kind of plant is it..." The two of them kept walking forward while asking and answering questions. Although Ranka was still a little worried about the little black demon, he was still studying very seriously. He still learned what he taught him yesterday. Remember them all.

The two walked forward for about a quarter of an hour when they heard the little black demon screaming and jumping down from the tree. The hair on his body was a little loose, and it looked like he had been fighting with something, but it looked like He didn't suffer any loss, but his appearance shocked Ranka. He immediately picked up the little black demon and asked repeatedly: "What's wrong? Little black demon, how are you? Are you injured?" ?”

Zhao Hai looked at the little black demon and said with a smile: "He is fine. It seems that he had a conflict with something, but he did not suffer any loss. Maybe he has killed that thing and is coming back to express his gratitude." Good job." After saying that, he looked at the little black demon and said with a smile: "Little black demon, what did you fight with? Lead us to see."

The little black demon squeaked a few times, then raised his little paw, pointed in a direction, and kept shouting. Looking at him, Zhao Hai turned to Lanka and smiled and said: "Let's go, Go over and take a look." Lanka was relieved at this time, hugged the little black demon, and walked in the direction he pointed.

After walking for a while, the two of them saw a snake lying under a tree not far ahead. This snake was as thick as an arm and more than ten meters long. Although this snake was among the snakes Zhao Hai had seen. , not really big, but in this forest, I’m afraid it’s not even a little guy.

Zhao Hai glanced at the snake, and then said: "Yes, this snake is poisonous, but precisely because of this, this snake is still very valuable. The snake skin and snake venom can be exchanged for the sword spirit." Stone and snake gall can also be used as medicine, so just put it away, this can be considered as our income today."

Ranka responded and immediately put the snake away. At this time, Ranka also saw how the snake died. The snake was possessed by the little black demon and used an ice pick to remove it from his body. His eyes were pierced and he was stabbed to death. He really didn't expect that the little black demon could be so powerful.

Zhao Hai didn't seem to be surprised at all. He then said to the little black demon: "Little black demon, go ahead and fight other monsters. War is the best training for you now. What's inside your body now?" Those space beads don't need to be expanded immediately, and you don't need to learn too many spells right away. As long as you learn all the spells you know now and practice them, your combat effectiveness will be It’s very strong, and what you need now is this kind of practical training, so go ahead.”

The little black demon squeaked twice, then jumped from Lanka's body to the tree, and disappeared in a blink of an eye. Zhao Hai did not lie to him. The little black demon really needs to improve himself through actual combat. In terms of combat power, monsters like the Little Black Demon that have opened their spiritual intelligence are not the same thing as those monsters that have not opened their spiritual intelligence. They can understand what Zhao Hai said. Although no one is that smart, but As long as they are taught well, they can still practice like monks.

The little black demon now has no shortage of energy in his body, and he also has no shortage of means. Zhao Hai has noticed before that he knows a lot of magic spells, and he can almost all the five elements spells, although they are all low-level ones. But as long as they are used properly, the attack power of these spells is also very powerful, so Zhao Hai is not in a hurry to teach the little black demon new things, but lets him practice what he has learned now. If he practices all the things he knows now, his combat effectiveness in the future will definitely not be too bad, and this will also save him a lot of detours.
