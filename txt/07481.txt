c7481 Greatsword

Following Bai Yan's order, all three cavalry queens were dispatched. These three cavalry were different from the disciples of the Blood Killing Sect. They practiced the art of combined attack from the very beginning, and they would not fight separately, because they almost There is no chance to fight separately. They all charge as a group, so their attack will be more powerful only if it is a collective charge.

These three cavalrymen were like three sharp swords, rushing directly into Kun's army. Those Kuns also formed a formation, but the formation was not very good, so these three cavalrymen followed behind. Rushed into the group. And after they passed by, each Kun turned into black smoke and disappeared. The speed at which they eliminated those Kuns was much faster than the disciples of the Blood Killing Sect.

Watching the charge of the three cavalry with white eyes, he couldn't help but reveal a smile on his face, and then said: "Okay, very good, come on, give the order, the fifth brigade will change into a drill formation, attack from the front, and the seventh brigade will attack from the front. The main team changed its formation into a sword formation and moved forward, while the other teams used a strangulation formation to face the enemy separately."

The staff officer immediately passed on the order. Following his order, he saw that among the enemies in front of Kun, not far from the puppet cavalry, two 100,000-person brigades suddenly changed their formations, and one 100,000-person brigades suddenly changed their formations. , directly turned into a huge drill, and rushed straight into Kun's formation, while another formation of 100,000 people suddenly turned into a huge fan-like formation lying flat. In the formation, all the fan blades were constantly rotating, and wherever they passed, Kun was swept into black smoke and disappeared directly.

At this time, Wen Wenhai and his squadron also arrived at the battlefield and directly joined the battlefield. However, Baiyan still issued orders one after another from time to time. Following his orders, the various brigades in the Blood Killing Sect began to attack from time to time. They would change formations, and their formation changes would be just right, often causing greater damage to those Kuns.

Time passed little by little. Although the number of Kun Lai this time was ten times that of the last time, the time it took the Blood Killing Sect to deal with them was not much more than the time spent last time. This time It's all because of Bai Yan's good command. His command of the various brigades has almost become an art, allowing those brigades to exert their maximum power. Only then can these Kun be defeated in less than thirty hours. , all destroyed.

After the last Kun was killed, Bai Yan let out a long sigh, and then he raised his head. But the moment he raised his head, a light flashed in his mind, and he suddenly remembered After hearing what Sheng Si said before, he immediately turned to look at Sheng Si.

At this time, Sheng Si also opened his eyes and was looking at him with deep meaning. Baiyan suddenly understood. He suddenly understood what Sheng Si meant. He also suddenly understood Zhao Hai. What he meant was that he couldn't help but show a hint of gratitude in his eyes, and then he gave Sheng Si a fist in his arms.

Sheng Si also smiled at him, then hugged his fists at him, and then closed his eyes again, but after he closed his eyes, Sheng Si said: "It's not the time now, wait for the next one After the war." After saying such a meaningless sentence, Sheng Si closed her eyes and stopped talking.

But Bai Yan understood what Sheng Si meant. He didn't say anything. He was about to go to the command hall for a meeting. Suddenly a staff officer walked up to Bai Yan and said to Bai Yan: "Elder Bai, what was just heard from Elder Wen Please take a look at the letter." After saying that, he handed a jade slip to Bai Yan.

Bai Yan was a little puzzled. He took the jade slip and mentally went to the Jade Slip City. He saw the writing on the jade slip: "Old Bai, I just received the order from the leader. This time the war meeting will not be held." , the boss's order is to give you full authority to command the next battle with Kun. All the disciples of the Blood Killing Sect who participate in the battle will obey your orders, including us and Lao Ding, all of them will obey your orders. You are good. Get ready."

Upon hearing these contents, Bai Yan was stunned at first, but then he immediately understood what Zhao Hai meant. Bai Yan couldn't help but put away the jade slip. Then he took a deep breath and looked up at the ceiling of the headquarters. His eyes seemed to have penetrated the ceiling, penetrated the entire radar ship, penetrated countless spaces, and saw a figure sitting cross-legged in the sky, looking down at him, with a smile on his face. The smile is so warm.

Looking at that person, Baiyan couldn't help but smile on his face. He knew who that person was. That person was Zhao Hai, and Zhao Hai was training him now and giving him a chance. If he could seize this opportunity, he would It's up to him. When he thought of this, Bai Yan's eyes couldn't help but show a firm look. Then he turned around and sat next to the radar screen. Then he slowly closed his eyes, as if falling asleep.

Time is moving forward bit by bit. There is no abnormality in the Blood Killing Sect. Wen Wenhai and the others do not have any objections to letting Bai Yan command this battle. They all know very well that Zhao Hai asked Bai Yan to do this. There must be a reason for that. Naturally, they won't have any objections, because Byakugan's command ability is there. To be honest, Byakugan's ability to command and fight is still stronger than that of Gu Yuanzheng. On some.

It's just that the Blood Killer Sect doesn't need strong command ability at all when fighting, so his command ability has never been taken seriously. Now it just seems to be taken a little more seriously. There is nothing special about it, and Wen Wenhai and the others It is very clear that Baiyan must have some special circumstances, otherwise Zhao Hai would not do this.

Soon it was time to attack. Bai Yan didn't need anyone to remind him. He slowly opened his eyes. He sat in front of the radar screen without saying a word for three whole days, so now he only needed to open his eyes. Open your eyes and you can see the radar screen and give orders directly.

After taking a look at the radar screen, Bai Yan said in a deep voice: "Action." The staff officer responded immediately, and then gave the order directly. Then the Blood Killing Sect's army began to advance at a very fast speed. In less than three hours, they had reached a distance of thousands of miles, and then the army stopped.

After the Blood Killing Sect's army came to a stop, Bai Yan said: "Order, all disciples expand their formation, and at the same time begin the first test, transforming their bodies into the shape of a sword, but the sword must be It needs to be bigger, and at the same time, Yin and Yang thunder pools are added to the sword body, and Buddha power, murderous aura, sword intention, and sword formations are added. In addition to these magic weapons, other magic formations can also be added to the magic weapon. This depends on the preferences of the disciples. It is up to them to decide. But please note that the length of this sword cannot be less than one hundred meters. The shape can be whatever they like. After the test is completed, put away the external incarnation. , waiting for my order."

The staff officer was stunned for a moment, then he immediately responded, and then went to pass the order. Soon the army's formation was opened, and then all the disciples began to transform their external avatars. They all turned into the shape of swords, but this shape turned into various shapes according to their own preferences, but none of them were less than a hundred meters in length.

And these swords are also very strange. After these swords were formed, the sword bodies of these swords have undergone some changes. The sword body of this sword is divided into three parts. The blade part is obviously very sharp and shining with cold light. It makes people dare not look directly. Everyone knows that it is because the sword's intention and sword intention are concentrated in that position, and the sword reacts.

As the sword blade moves in, there is a layer of blood-red light. This layer of blood-red light seems to be coming from the sword body, carrying a very strong smell of blood, and this layer is exactly what it is. It is the effect of the blessing of murderous intent. The sword body blessed with murderous intent will have even greater lethality.

The last part is the spine of the sword. That part is golden. Although the color is very gorgeous, it has a solemn and majestic feeling on the sword. It makes people feel very peaceful when they see it. This feeling is very It's strange, and the reason why this happens is because there is the blessing of Buddha's power, and Buddha's power is the most effective way to deal with those Kuns.

After all the disciples had tried it, they put away all their external avatars and sat there quietly, waiting for the enemy to arrive. At this time, Baiyan didn't have any demands anymore, just quietly. Sitting there, quietly waiting for the enemy to appear.

A piercing siren sounded, and all the disciples of the Blood Killing Sect were in high spirits. At this time, Byakugan slowly opened his eyes. He glanced at the screen. At this time, countless small dots appeared on the screen. , Baiyan zoomed in on the screen, and found that those small dots were all those Kuns, but the appearance of those Kuns did not change at all, they were still the same.

When he saw this situation, Bai Yan couldn't help but let out a sigh. He was really afraid that those Kuns would change their appearance. If those Kuns changed their appearance, it would mean that those Kuns had evolved. When they were dealing with them, they would It will be even more difficult. There is no change now, which means that those Kuns are not attacking and they can attack normally.

Soon, the Kun Peng entered the Anti-Blood Killing Sect, which was still about a thousand miles away. Those Kun didn't seem nervous at all. They already knew that the current Blood Killing Sect would not attack them at this distance. Yes, people from the Blood Killing Sect will attack them only when they are hundreds of miles away from the Blood Killing Sect.

But what they didn't know was that just when they entered within a thousand miles of the Blood Killing Sect, Bai Yan suddenly ordered: "All disciples, turn your external body into the giant sword before and attack." As he followed After the order, all the disciples of the Blood Killing Sect immediately transformed their bodies into giant swords, and then the giant swords rushed forward. However, they still maintained their formation while rushing forward. Shape, and looking at it this way, the entire Blood Killing Sect's attack was like a rain of swords. Countless flying swords were like schools of fish in the ocean, rushing forward, and it looked like a mess. , but it is orderly, a certain order has been maintained internally, and the actions have not been affected at all.
