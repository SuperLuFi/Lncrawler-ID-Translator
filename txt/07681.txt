Zhao Hai's decision to form this cabinet was not an impromptu decision. In fact, almost all the affairs of the Blood Killing Sect are handled by these people. The cabinet members and alternate members are all the more prestigious elders of the Blood Killing Sect. , and each of them is responsible for different things. Now it is just to make their identities more clear, so that other core elders will come out to stop them from doing anything in the future.

With this cabinet, it will be easier for Zhao Hai to deal with anything in the future. After all, Zhao Hai can handle some small things, and Zhao Hai is not afraid that these cabinet members will rebel against him or give him to him. First, because his prestige in the Blood Killing Sect is unparalleled, and these people are absolutely loyal to him. Second, there are many of his servants among these cabinet members. With these people around, Shen Every move in the pavilion is under his surveillance, and it is impossible for him to cause any trouble.

After announcing this matter, Zhao Hai continued: "In the future, the first branch of the Blood Killing Sect must have an automatic exchange machine. In this automatic exchange machine, you can accept tasks by yourself, and you can go on it by yourself. To exchange what you need, the automatic management system in the sect must also be better utilized. The deans of each branch must also report the management of each branch from time to time. If there is any problem with that branch, It must be reported through the automatic management system, so that the sect can solve it in the shortest possible time. If anyone fails to report the problem after discovering it, then if there is a problem in the future, the dean will be the first to be held accountable. Responsibility, the elders at all levels and the heads of each branch must also take responsibility. At the same time, all branches must also have a real law enforcement department. If something goes wrong, the law enforcement department must also have a certain amount of responsibility. Responsibility, the law enforcement department is not allowed to interfere with the dean's management, and the dean has no direct jurisdiction over the law enforcement department. The powers of the two departments are separated. Do you understand what I mean?"

When everyone heard what Zhao Hai said, they immediately said loudly: "Yes, Sect Master, we will understand." Of course they understood. Zhao Huo's meaning was very obvious. From now on, the dean will be responsible for managing the ordinary disciples of the Blood Killing Sect. And this dean is, in other words, the manager of a courtyard where the disciples of the Blood Killing Sect live. These courtyards may be large or small. The large ones may have tens of thousands of people, while the small ones may only have a few thousand. Each courtyard has a dean. At the same time, there is also a law enforcement department in this courtyard, and the power of this law enforcement department is separate from that of the dean. The law enforcement department does not have the power to manage this courtyard, and the dean does not have the power to manage the law enforcement department. They belong to two different systems. .

In this way, if something happens to the dean or if there is any problem, the law enforcement department can directly take care of it or report it. If the law enforcement department does something wrong, the dean can also report it, so that the courtyard can be There will never be a situation where one person speaks the loudest.

Zhao Hai glanced at everyone, and then said: "If the Blood Killing Sect wants to develop, management must be done, but at the same time, we must also pay attention to the management methods. We must not manage chaos, but we must not avoid chaos. At this level, You have to take control of it yourself. As for logistics, you don’t have to worry about that. As long as it is what you need, just report it directly. The cabinet can communicate directly with Laura and the others. Our previous reward system of the Blood Killing Sect will not change. , Okay, that’s all for today, let’s all leave. If anything happens, the cabinet members can decide for themselves.” After saying this, Zhao Hai disappeared in a flash.

When Wen Wenhai and the others saw Zhao Hai leaving, they couldn't help but smile bitterly. Then Wen Wenhai turned to look at the others, and then said: "Okay, everyone, it seems that the sect master really doesn't want to care about the sect. Things have happened, but today, on behalf of the newly established cabinet, I would like to say a few words to you. Although the sect has said that we will hand over the affairs here to our cabinet to manage, you are the core elders of the sect. We absolutely cannot ignore anything, so everyone, although our cabinet manages the entire sect, it does not mean that everything will be fine for you. Things that were yours to manage before are still yours to manage. The sect leader is just giving us a bigger deal this time. He only has some power so that he can just be lazy."

When everyone heard what he said, they couldn't help laughing. In the Blood Killing Sect, there were not many people who dared to say that about Zhao Hai. Wen Wenhai was just making a joke. He had the closest relationship with Zhao Hai. That's why he dared to talk to Zhao Hai like this. Others didn't have such courage.

But everyone also knows that what Wen Wenhai said is not wrong. In the past, they, the core elders, also had their own affairs, but they could directly report the matters they managed to Zhao Hai, but now they have to It must be reported to the cabinet, and then the cabinet will decide whether to report it to Zhao Hai.

However, no one objected because they knew very well that Zhao Hai rarely took care of things in the sect. In fact, many things in the sect were now handled by Wen Wenhai and others. However, Wen Wenhai and the others only received temporary authorization from Zhao Hai in the past, but now they have decided on this title directly.

Seeing that no one objected, Wen Wenhai also let out a sigh of relief. Then he turned to everyone and said: "Okay, everyone, let's go back and do our own business. We, too, have to have a meeting for a while. We still need to study carefully how to divide the labor."

Everyone responded, then stood up, saluted Wen Wenhai, then turned and left. After everyone left, Wen Wenhai turned to the other cabinet members and alternate members and said, "Okay, everyone, let's discuss how to deal with the sect's affairs in the future. It seems that the sect leader is serious this time. I don’t plan to take care of too many sect affairs anymore, so I just leave everything to us.”

Everyone also smiled, and Yao Jianhao said: "It's nothing to blame us. The sect master really needs to put all his attention on training now. The sect master is our sect's Dinghai Shenzhen. As long as the sect master has the strength, If it is strong enough, then our Blood Killing Sect can run rampant in any interface, so for things like managing the sect, it is better not to disturb the sect master too much." Everyone also nodded.

If an ordinary person were to say that the emperor should practice Taoism in the palace every day and pursue immortality, and leave small things like running the country to us, the emperor would definitely chop off his head and wait for the Chinese New Year, because When you say this, you clearly want to seize power.

But in the world of cultivation, no one has an opinion when Yao Jianhao said this, because in the world of cultivation, the leader of a sect is not necessarily the most powerful person in the sect. The supreme elder of a sect is the one who The person who really has the final say in the sect, the sect leader is just the manager of the sect. Compared with the Supreme Elder, his identity and status are still far behind. Why does this happen? Just because of strength.

The world of cultivation respects strength. If you are strong, your status in the sect will naturally be high. If you become the supreme elder, you will have a higher status than the sect master. The supreme elder usually concentrates on hard cultivation. , didn't want to manage the affairs of the sect, so I found one and let him manage the sect. Therefore, the status of the sect leader of some sects is really not as high as that of the Supreme Elder.

The Blood Killing Sect is a little different. There is no Supreme Elder in the Blood Killing Sect. The most powerful person in the Blood Killing Sect is Zhao Hai, and he is the leader of the Blood Killing Sect. Zhao Hai also thought about taking the leader He wants to give up his position to others and become a supreme elder himself, but that is not possible. If he really says that he does not want to be the sect leader and gives up his position as sect leader, no matter who he gives it to, he will become the entire Blood Killing Sect. The public enemy of the sect, so he could only be the leader of the sect. In the end, he had no choice but to create such a cabinet. There were still a lot of cabinet members, but the disciples of the Blood Killing Sect all understood what was going on.

Now in the Blood Killing Sect, Zhao Hai is the supreme ruler. No one dares not to listen to what he says, and Laura and the others control the logistics department, which can be said to be the lifeblood of all Blood Killing Sect disciples and also the Blood Killing Sect’s money. Bag, and Wen Wenhai and the others manage the daily life of the Blood Killing Sect disciples, so as to ensure the normal operation of the Blood Killing Sect.

Everyone came to a small conference room. After sitting down, Wen Wenhai looked at everyone and said, "To be honest, I am really not prepared at all for what the boss said about the cabinet today. I just went into retreat." When I came out, I didn’t know much about the current situation of the sect. Now I am asked to manage the cabinet. I am really confused. Fortunately, everyone is still here, so I have nothing to worry about. The boss established this The purpose of the cabinet is to allow us to be more legitimate when we manage the sect in the future. In fact, what we did before is what we still do now, so we actually have nothing to worry about."

Everyone also nodded. This is indeed the case. The reason why Zhao Hai created this cabinet is indeed just to correct their names. In the past, the management of the Blood Killing Sect was also carried out by them, but now it is just. Just let them be justified in what they are doing.

Wen Wenhai then said: "Now that we have at most two interfaces, we can leave here. The boss must have a sense of crisis. He doesn't want us to be oppressed by other sects when we go to Wanshan Realm. So now he wants to use more of his defense time for training, so he has left the management of the sect to us, and we just need to do a good job."

At this point, he paused for a moment, and then said: "There are still a lot of things going on with the sect recently. Let's set a goal first. In one month, we will deal with all the sect's things. After getting it straightened out, we will prepare to attack the world of heaven and humanity. What do you think? If everyone agrees, then we will take this goal as the standard and start making full preparations. If you don't agree, tell us your reasons. "
