c7001 reconnaissance

After the Blood Killing Sect occupied all the new territories, Zhao Hai's research was completed. He directly distributed these two magic formations to the Blood Killing Sect's disciples, allowing the Blood Killing Sect's disciples to Immediately add it to the incarnation of the Dharma Form and Energy Array, so that these two arrays can function as quickly as possible. .

Of course, Zhao Hai also told the disciples of the Blood Killing Sect what the functions of these two magic formations were. The disciples of the Blood Killing Sect heard that these two magic formations warmed and protected the soul. They were all very surprised. They immediately put these two magic arrays into the incarnation of the Dharma Form and the Energy Array, but the effect was very obvious. They felt the connection between themselves and the Dharma Form. It seemed to be even closer, which surprised them both.

However, this time it can only be regarded as a small upgrade. It was completed quickly and did not take much time. Zhao Hai and the others also knew that now that their territory was expanding, they could proceed to the next step, and their The next step is to further expand their territory.

Everyone gathered in the main hall of the Blood Killing Sect. Zhao Hai looked at Wen Wenhai and the others and said solemnly: "We defeated the enemy again and again, and the territory of the Blood Killing Sect expanded again and again, but we can't It’s going to stop like this, and we have to keep moving forward until we take down the entire interface.”

Everyone nodded, and everyone looked very excited. Of course they wanted to take down the entire interface, but they still had to think carefully about what to do next. To be honest, the first few times The attack really scared them, especially the last one. When they heard that the last attack almost ignored all defenses and directly attacked people's souls, they felt scared in their hearts.

Soul, that's the soul. Monks have always been wary of souls, especially their own souls. Almost no one of them dares to conduct research in this area, because if they don't do it well, their souls will fly away, so they don't dare to mess with it. Come on, it is precisely because of this that the monks' research on the soul is actually still far behind.

The enemy's final blow was to directly attack the person's soul, which was terrible. If other disciples of the Blood Killing Sect had been outside at that time, the consequences would have been really unimaginable. It is precisely because of this, so They now have some concerns about what to do next. If such a powerful offensive method appears, their losses will be huge.

Zhao Hai glanced at everyone and knew what they were thinking. He smiled slightly and said: "Wen Hai, have you designed the several ways to improve our disciples' fighting methods that you were asked to propose before? If so, then Take it out and let me see it." Zhao Hai really wanted to see what kind of fighting method Wen Wenhai and the others had designed.

Wen Wenhai responded, immediately took out a jade slip, handed it to Zhao Hai, and then said: "Boss, these are some new fighting methods we have designed. Take a look." Wen Wenhai Hai said this, telling Zhao Hai that these fighting methods were designed by all of them after discussion, and they were also the most satisfactory, and let Zhao Hai see if there were any problems.

Zhao Hai nodded, and then he took a look at the fighting methods designed by Wen Wenhai and others, and found that this fighting method has really changed a lot. These fighting methods are mainly two methods: positive and strange. The correct method is a face-to-face positional battle. The two sides set up a large formation and fight head-on. Qi actually means to use surprise troops to attack the enemy with small groups. These small groups can be called Qi.

In the frontal attack, Wen Wenhai and the others mainly used strong soldiers, spears, sword and shield soldiers, and heavy armor soldiers. The soldiers were divided into two types, one was infantry and the other was cavalry. Each infantry group consisted of ten people. Of these ten people, two were wolf soldiers, four were sword and shield soldiers, two were spearmen, and two were slave soldiers.

The cavalry is a team of its own. They are all heavy cavalry. Both the people and the mounts are heavily armored. They are armed with lances, sabers, and bows and arrows. They can attack from both distance and distance, and they are very powerful. This design is very reasonable. , Zhao Hai still appreciates it very much. After all, when the two armies are facing each other, the most important thing is to have a dignified formation.

The large formation set up by Wen Wenhai and others is based on various formations and the cooperation of various arms. During the battle, they can stand in their positions at any time. When necessary, they only need to give an order from the commander. Next, all soldiers can put the formation talisman at their feet at the first time, so that a large formation is completed. Moreover, such a large formation will not affect the forward and backward movement, and can still operate normally. This is the most important thing. .

After Zhao Hai saw Wen Wenhai's design, he nodded with great satisfaction, then turned to Wen Wenhai and said: "Very good, you can train the disciples in the real illusion, so that they can become familiar with it as soon as possible. This kind of battle method, Laura, you must also use the three-dimensional battle formation method that you used when you commanded the undead clan to fight. We don’t know what kind of things we will encounter in the future. Your The three-dimensional battle formation method still has its own uniqueness. In the past, we did not use it as a disciple because the training of the three-dimensional battle formation method took too long. Now we have external incarnations. It will be much easier to train in the real illusion, and this kind of battle formation method can also be put to use."

Laura responded, Zhao Hai turned to Wen Wenhai and the others and said with a smile: "The three-dimensional battle formation method is actually a fighting method that Laura and the others developed a long time ago. This fighting method also focuses on disciples. , but it is a large formation in the air, and if the large formation in the air is flat, it will be too thin, because the enemy will attack you from above and below. At that time, you We may not be able to defend against the big formation, so we have this three-dimensional battle formation method. Disciples will also have to learn it in the future. After all, no one can say what kind of enemies we will encounter in the future."

Wen Wenhai and the others all responded. Many of them didn't know that Laura and the others had such abilities, so they all looked at Laura and the others in surprise. Laura and the others didn't say anything, they just sat there with calm faces. The three-dimensional battle formation technique was very difficult, and they had no way to explain it now, so it was better not to say anything.

Zhao Hai smiled and said: "That's it for the battle formation training. Let's talk about the attack. In fact, we made a mistake the first two times we attacked. This mistake was that we just defended At our point, we have only been thinking about advancing step by step and finally taking down the enemy, but we never thought that we could also enter the Shadow Clan to conduct reconnaissance."

When Zhao Hai said this, everyone was stunned. They really had not thought of this. There has always been a difference between the laws of heaven and earth here and the laws of heaven and earth of the Shadow Clan, so they have never They had thought about entering the Shadow Clan for reconnaissance, but now that they heard what Zhao Hai said, they felt that they had indeed forgotten this aspect.

Zhao Hai glanced at them and said in a deep voice: "Our power of law is very different from that of the Shadow Clan, but don't forget that we have actually obtained the Shadow Clan's Wheel of Law a long time ago. , we need to use this wheel of law on our external incarnation, so that we can pretend to be members of the Shadow Clan. As long as we can do this, then we can conduct reconnaissance on the Shadow Clan."

When Wen Wenhai and the others heard what Zhao Hai said, their eyes lit up, but then Wen Wenhai said solemnly: "But boss, we can pretend to be Shadow Clan people, but here in the sonic interface, there are very few Shadow Clan people, and They all also know how to atomize, so if we send people to detect the power of the Shadow Clan's laws, we may be discovered by them soon."

This is also one of the reasons why the Blood Killing Sect cannot conduct reconnaissance on the Shadow Clan, but Zhao Hai has already thought about this problem. He said solemnly: "I finally thought of a way, that is, let the Mist Hidden Clan Go and conduct reconnaissance in the power of the Shadow Clan Law. They can enter the underground and move outside without any restrictions. In addition, there is no divine light here. Although they operate underground, there will be some effects. , but the impact is not very big. After all, even if there is divine light, it doesn't matter, our armor is very different from the original."

When everyone heard what Zhao Hai said, they all nodded. Wen Wenhai said in a deep voice: "This is feasible. It would be very beneficial for us to let the Kirigakure clan investigate the situation. We don't have to worry even if we are here. No." We know what methods the enemy will use to deal with us." Everyone else nodded in agreement.

Zhao Hai looked at them and smiled slightly, then turned to Wulong and said: "Wulong, did you hear that? I leave this matter to you. Remember, we must ensure the safety of your clan. Do you understand?" Wulong is the leader of the clan, so he is naturally qualified to participate in such a meeting, but he did not expect that he would suddenly get this order.

Wulong is very warlike. He has long wanted to join the war, but he has never had a good opportunity. Now that the opportunity has come, he will not let it go. He immediately stood up and said to Zhao Hai: "Yes, justice Father, I will make arrangements right away, and I will never let you down." Wu Long is Zhao Hai's adopted son. He is absolutely loyal to Zhao Hai, and he almost grew up watching Zhao Hai, so he He has always called Zhao Hai his adoptive father, which surprised no one.

Zhao Hai nodded, then smiled slightly and said: "Go and make arrangements now, people will be sent out immediately, go ahead." Wulong responded, turned around and left. Then Zhao Hai turned to Wen Yuming and said: "Lao Wen, you send people from your Shenji Hall to install soul defense arrays on each blood-killing battle fort. Although this kind of array is said to be installed on us, In the incarnation of the energy array, the best effect can be exerted, but when installed on the Blood Killing Battle Fortress, it also has certain defensive capabilities, especially for direct attacks on the soul, their defensive effect is still good. Install it on the Blood Killing Battle Fort to make the people in the Blood Killing Battle Fort safer."
