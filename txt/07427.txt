Wen Wenhai and the others are really not so nervous now. Since the disciples of those small teams learned to fuse the dharma and the energy beast array, they really don't worry about how to deal with the Dapeng clan, because in their It seems that their teams are now capable of dealing with the Dapeng clan.

It is precisely because of this certainty that Wen Wenhai and the others did not take this failure to heart at all. In their opinion, they were actually too careless this time, and at the same time they also somewhat underestimated the huge consequences. With Peng's strength, if they had prepared early, that Dapeng would definitely not be able to escape.

When Gu Yuanzheng heard what Wen Wenhai and the others said, his expression softened, and then he also smiled and said: "Yes, you are right. This time we were indeed a little careless. We thought we were ready, but there are still Some places are not well prepared. We have always thought that Zhanzhi Fortress is the strongest point of our Blood Killing Sect, but we have all forgotten that the situation is different now. The combat power of Dapeng is very powerful, and he is exactly the Attacking the one we think is the strongest is a desperate effort, but fortunately, he will come again at night, so there is nothing to worry about."

Wen Wenhai nodded and said with a smile: "Yes, you don't have to worry about anything. Now all the disciples of our Blood Killing Sect can use the fusion method. As long as they train, they can use the combination of the fusion method and the energy beast formation. When the time comes, it will not be easy to deal with those Dapeng, so you don’t have anything to worry about.”

Everyone nodded, and Wen Wenhai said to Gu Yuanzheng: "Also, Lao Gu, this time I actually want to criticize you. Have you been too honest recently? What kind of battles have Lao Zhen and the others made? You just follow the plan and don't make any changes on your own, which is different from your past."

Gu Yuanzheng's temper is actually not very good. In the past, when he was commanding battles, he would often make some changes before the battle, but recently this has become less and less common. That's why Wen Wenhai said this. At that time, the battle plan was very detailed, and it was impossible to compare with the generals' on-the-battle command, because the situation on the battlefield can be said to be changing rapidly. No one knows when and what kind of things will happen. When the time comes, it will depend on the generals. Take command on the spot.

When Gu Yuanzheng heard what Wen Wenhai said, he was a little embarrassed. He said to Wen Wenhai: "Isn't this the battle plan made by Mr. Zhen and the others? Is it too detailed? I can't find anything wrong with it. In my opinion, their battle plan was already perfect, so I didn’t think too much about it.”

When Wen Wenhai heard what he said, he couldn't help but smile, and then said: "You still have to think more about it in the future. After all, you are the frontline commander. Even we don't know as much about the situation on the frontline as you do, so you must You have to think more and make more preparations. The frontline commander does not just let you command the battle with a battle plan. You must have your own ideas. In a real battle, you don’t have to listen to what I say. , let alone others."

Gu Yuanzheng nodded without saying anything. What happened this time was also a lesson for him. He must pay more attention when commanding battles in the future. Although the battle plan is perfect, it is not Almighty. At the same time, this incident also reminded him that he must delegate some of the command power on the front line and hand it over to the squad leaders below, allowing them to make some changes when necessary, because they are the The ones who are actually on the front lines, fighting the enemy.

Delegating power does not mean letting them do whatever they want. They still have to execute orders, otherwise it would not be an army. There is a degree in between. How to control this degree depends on Gu Yuanzheng, Wen Wenhai They believed that the Ancient Expedition would be successful, after all, he was also an old commander.

Wen Wenhai wasn't talking about Gu Yuanzheng. After all, Gu Yuanzheng was an old man. He knew the seriousness of the matter, so he said directly: "Okay, that's all for today. Wait until the roc comes in the evening." , we can’t let him run away, we must deal with him. After we deal with that guy, we will rest for a while and let all the disciples train well, sharpen their swords and chop firewood, and then in Get rid of them."

None of them had any objections. Now they had faced off against the roc. If they didn't take care of the roc, they wouldn't even be able to sleep well. Naturally, they wouldn't be able to train with peace of mind, so they had to deal with the roc first. As long as Dapeng is taken care of, he can then train with peace of mind.

When Wen Wenhai saw that no one objected, he nodded to everyone and said: "Okay, everyone has no objections, let's take action. We dealt with that guy first yesterday, and then we went to have a good training. Everyone Get ready, Lao Gu, if you need any decorations there, just tell us directly, you are welcome to tell us."

Gu Yuanzheng nodded. They really didn't need any arrangements there. In fact, they had already arranged the magic circle. If they hadn't been careless and didn't activate the magic circle, they would never have let the roc escape. Lost, so the Ancient Expedition did not make any requirements because there was no need for it.

The day passed like this. Gu Yuanzheng and the others had been waiting for the big roc all day. The big roc had escaped from their hands twice. They absolutely could not let him escape again, so Gu Yuanzheng They had been waiting for him during the expedition. They were waiting for the big roc to come and took care of him.

Not long after Shen Shi in the afternoon, a black spot appeared on the radar. Looking at the black spot, Gu Yuanzheng could not help but reveal a sneer on his face, and said in a deep voice: "The combat effectiveness of these Dapeng is good, but It is a pity that these Dapeng are affected by the power of law and can only take fixed routes and fixed times every day. In this way, it will be too easy for us to deal with them. Pass the order and all the magic circles will Open them all, and you must not let him escape this time. If you let him escape, I, the frontline commander, will no longer have to do my job."

Someone immediately responded, and the staff officers immediately issued the order. The disciples of the Blood Killing Sect were all waiting there, but the big roc did not stop or take a detour, and rushed directly into the Blood Killing Sect. In the base, at this time, as soon as he entered the base, he immediately felt a weight on his body, but he did not stop, but flapped his wings vigorously, and wanted to speed up.

At this moment, a big net came up to cover the face. This big net was of course made of Babel Vine. A look of ridicule flashed across the eyes of the Dapeng, and he rushed forward. All the Babel Vine, Everything was interrupted by him, but at this moment, Dapeng felt as if his body was suddenly pressed up a big mountain, which made his figure fall down involuntarily, and he almost fell directly Just fell into the woods.

Dapeng felt something was wrong with him. He turned around and looked at himself, only to find that there were many small steel balls on his body. These small steel balls were not very big, but they weighed as much as the mountain. The most important thing coming from these small steel balls was that these small steel balls seemed to be constantly absorbing the power in his body. This feeling really made him feel very uncomfortable.

He shook his body, trying to shake off these small steel balls, but he failed. The small steel balls seemed to be attached to their bodies and could not be shaken off at all. At this moment, one by one, Giants also appeared in front of him, and then those giants turned into rivers of blood and rolled towards him.

The Dapeng naturally knew how powerful the blood river was. To be honest, he really didn't want to fight with the blood river, so he moved his body and got into the woods. It seemed that he still wanted to use the old method. Get out from under the woods and escape this disaster.

But it was a pity that this time he made the wrong calculation. Just as he was heading into the woods, the trees in the woods suddenly swayed their branches and hit him straight at him. At the same time, the woods suddenly rose up. There was a repulsive force, as if something was pushing him upwards, but he couldn't get down.

Just when the Dapeng was stunned, he saw a long golden arrow shooting towards him like lightning. He wanted to hide, but he couldn't escape because he just wanted to fall into the woods. All his power was directed downwards, but because he was pushed by the repulsive force released from the woods, his force and the repulsive force in the woods reached a kind of competition process. At this time, he wanted to Changing tactics is almost impossible.

The arrow shot into Dapeng's body immediately. Dapeng let out a mournful cry and was immediately pushed up into the sky by the repulsive force in the woods. At this moment, the repulsive force suddenly disappeared. It disappeared, and the Dapeng fell downwards. But at this moment, there was a flash of sword light, and the Dapeng's head was cut off with a single blow of a big knife. The Dapeng didn't even let out a last scream. If it is sent out, it will die immediately.

Seeing the big roc turn into black smoke and disappear, Gu Yuanzheng took a deep breath. To be honest, he was really afraid that the big roc was running away. If the big roc was running, then he would be afraid. He really has no face to be the commander-in-chief of the front line. If he lets the same enemy escape in his hands three times, how can he have the face to be the commander-in-chief of the front line?

After taking care of the Dapeng, Gu Yuanzheng was relieved. He turned to the staff beside him and said: "Go, give the order, all the disciples go back and rest. We have to rest for a few days to prepare for training, and then attack the Garuda Realm." , so stop expanding externally and go ahead." The staff officer immediately responded, then turned around to give the order, while Gu Yuanzheng went to find Wen Wenhai and the others.

When Gu Yuanzheng arrived at Wen Wenhai's command hall, he found that almost all the core elders had arrived. He was stunned for a moment, and then saluted everyone, and everyone returned the salute with a smile. Wen Wenhai looked at Gu Yuanzheng. , also smiled and said: "Lao Gu, you did a great job. What you did this time was really great. You took care of the enemy cleanly. Well done." This time Gu Yuanzheng and the others did indeed It's so beautiful that Wen Wenhai admires Gu Yuanzheng a little.
