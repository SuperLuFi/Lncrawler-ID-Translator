c7562 action

The people of the Languang Zhang Yu clan are not very good-tempered, so when they heard what Bafang said, they all shouted to avenge their own clansmen. Looking at their appearance, Bafang's expression slowly relaxed. , he is actually still very worried. If all the people in the clan oppose joining the Blood Killing Sect, it will not be easy to handle. Now looking at their appearance, Bafang knows that there is no way to join the Blood Killing Sect. .

Thinking of this, Bafang continued to speak: "I think you all know very well how the Dragon King has treated us over the years. The Dragon King has never forgotten to suppress our clan in these years. How many Dragon King's are there in Pearl City now? People, even if I don’t tell you, we know very well that the Dragon King is unkind, so don’t blame us, the Blue Light Octopus Clan, for being unjust. Moreover, I went to see the Blood Killing Sect before, and the leader of the Blood Killing Sect even came out to see me in person. , you must know that the strength of this sect leader is stronger than the Dragon King. He was also very polite to me, and told me that as long as our Blue Light Octopus clan joins the Blood Killing Sect, we will become members of the Blood Killing Sect. We have whatever the disciples of the Blood Killing Sect have, and we will never look down upon us. Now, I just want to ask all of you whether our Blue Light Octopus clan wants to join the Blood Killing Sect. I think you should also be very interested. We know clearly that the Blood Killing Sect is so strong. If we don’t join the Blood Killing Sect, then we will be the Blood Killing Sect’s enemies. By then, even if we want to seek revenge from the Dragon King, it will be impossible. This matter, I can’t make the decision alone, so I just want to hear your opinions, let’s all talk about it.”

As soon as Bafang said this, everyone in the conference room immediately became quiet. They also knew very well that this matter was also very important. If they did not join the Blood Killing Sect, they might have to take revenge before they could take revenge. They were wiped out by the Blood Killing Sect. Judging from what Bafang said about the Blood Killing Sect, it is absolutely impossible for them to be the Blood Killing Sect's opponents.

But they were a little unwilling to let them join the Blood Killing Sect like this. It was precisely because of this that they seemed to have a headache. They didn't know what to say for a while, so no one spoke. Sitting there silently, this really surprised Bafang.

However, Bafang also knew that he could not force them now, and he also understood the mood of these people. To be honest, if he had not seen the strength of the Blood Killing Sect with his own eyes, and how the people of the Blood Killing Sect dealt with those striped shells, Yes, he didn't want to join the Blood Killing Sect. After all, joining the Blood Killing Sect would be tantamount to betraying Shenlonghai Kingdom. They really didn't want to take such a name, so everyone didn't dare to speak casually.

Bafang looked at everyone and said in a deep voice: "I know everyone is in a dilemma and don't want to say anything, so let me say it first. My opinion is that we can join the Blood Killing Sect. Join the Blood Killing Sect. , there is nothing wrong with becoming a disciple of the Blood Killing Sect. Let’s not talk about anything else. After joining the Blood Killing Sect, we can get countless skills and countless materials. There is nothing wrong with this. It is better than being in Fighting to the death here is strong, who are we fighting to die for here? For ourselves? For ourselves, we can not die, but for the Dragon King? The Dragon King can be said to be our enemy, why should we fight to death for our enemy? ? For the other people in the Shenlong Sea Kingdom? The Blood Killing Sect has said that they can also join the Blood Killing Sect, and they don’t want to kill them even after the Blood Killing Sect. For our inheritance? The Blood Killing Sect doesn’t want to steal our inheritance, So now I really can’t figure out why we must die in battle.”

After hearing what he said, everyone nodded. It was indeed as Bafang said. They really couldn't find a reason to die in battle now. For their own sake, they could join the Blood Killing Sect so that they would not die. For the sake of inheritance, the Blood Killing Sect also looks down on your inheritance. For the Dragon King, it is even more impossible. The Dragon King is now their enemy. Will they die fighting for their enemy? Their brains are sick, so in this way, they really have no reason to die in battle, so they are really tempted by the advice from all directions.

Bafang looked at everyone, and then said in a deep voice: "I have already expressed my opinion, and it will be up to you now. If you don't agree to join the Blood Killing Sect, then there is nothing to say. We will start working hard right away. Let's prepare for the battle. Just fight to the death with the Blood Killing Sect. If you also agree to join the Blood Killing Sect, then we must take action immediately. First, we must deal with all the Dragon King's spies in Pearl City. Then tell the people in the city what kind of place the Blood Killing Sect is and why we should join the Blood Killing Sect. Only in this way can we join the Blood Killing Sect with everyone in Pearl City instead of just watching. They were killed by members of the Blood Killing Sect, do you have any opinions?"

Bazu spoke first: "Brother, I agree to join the Blood Killing Sect. Without any reason to fight to the death, we naturally don't want to die. By joining the Blood Killing Sect, we can find a good destination for everyone. Isn't this great? Those guys sent by the Dragon King in the city were all extremely arrogant. I had long disliked them, so I dealt with them directly. Then we told the people in the city to let them join the blood with us. I don’t think they will object to killing the clan, after all, our Blue Light Octopus clan has always been good to the people in the city over the years.”

Everyone else also nodded. What Bazu said was absolutely correct. In recent years, the Blue Light Octopus clan has been very good to the various races in the city. They have never bullied them, and they have treated the various races in the city very well. Having more people helps. If that were the case, the people in the city would at best think that the Blue-Light Octopus Clan is good. However, the Dragon King gave the Blue-Light Octopus Clan a Divine Assistance Technique.

Among the people sent by the Dragon King to Pearl City to monitor the Blue Light Octopus clan, few are good birds. They are all extremely arrogant and have done a lot of bad things in the city, which makes the people in the city treat them badly. But there is no good impression at all, and the Blue Light Octopus clan has been fighting against them, which has gained people's support. Now the people here in Pearl City are treating the Blu-ray Octopus clan better.

It is precisely because of this that Bazu said that people in the city should join the Blood Killing Sect with them, because the Dragon King's divine assist has helped them win the hearts and minds of the people, so they naturally don't have to worry about anything. They believe that the city will The people inside should join the Blood Killing Sect with them.

Bafang glanced at the others and said in a deep voice: "Do you have any other opinions? If you have any, just say it. We are thinking of other ways." Bafang is actually sure now that the blue-light octopus family should not be If there are people who oppose him, they should also agree to join the Blood Killing Sect.

Everyone shook their heads. Seeing that everyone was shaking their heads, Bafang said solemnly: "Okay, everyone has no objections. Then we have decided to join the Blood Killing Sect. Then we will do what I said before. All those guys sent by the Dragon King have been dealt with. Over the years, the Dragon King has sent countless people to Pearl City, either overtly or covertly. These people are actually all under our surveillance, but they don't know it. , then there is nothing to say. We can just take action. Bazu, you lead our clan and take action tonight. All the people we know sent by the Dragon King to the city will be killed. I’ll destroy it, go ahead.”

Bazu responded, Bafang turned to look at the others, and then said in a deep voice: "We are all going to take action tonight. There are some masters among those people. We must keep them all in the city and don't let them go." They're done, okay, let's all go down and get ready, we'll take action tonight." Everyone responded, then turned and left.

The Blue Light Octopus clan has always been very united. They know very well that if they are not united, they will be divided by the Dragon King. In the end, they will be dealt with one by one. If they do not want to be dealt with by the Dragon King, then they will just Maybe we should unite and fight together to keep warm.

Not to mention, the Blue-Light Octopus Clan has always been very united. If it had not been so united, the Blue-Light Octopus Clan would not have been able to reach today. It is precisely because of this that the Blue-Light Octopus Clan is really divided. There is no problem at all, so Bazu is very relieved about the inside of the blue octopus.

In the bright night, the entire Pearl City seemed to have fallen into a deep sleep, but the blue-light octopus clan was out. The flashing blue light on their bodies was like will-o'-the-wisps appearing in the dark night. From a distance, it looked very strange. It's scary, but for the people of the blue-light octopus family, it has no impact at all. On the contrary, this flickering light actually becomes their light source, making it easier for them to move.

That night, people in Pearl City heard countless shouts of killing. The shouts of killing were very intense. Many people wanted to go out to have a look, but when they went out, they saw people from the Blue Light Octopus clan standing on the street. Only all of them took to the streets, which let the people in the city know that the Blue Light Octopus clan must be doing something tonight, and naturally they did not dare to move.

The shouting of killing continued all night. Early the next morning, when the people in the city cautiously walked out of their homes, they found that although there were still many blue-light octopus clan patrolling around the city, they were no longer the only ones. After going out, the people in the city carefully walked out of their homes, and then carefully went about their own business, while also carefully inquiring about what happened in the city.

When the people in the city heard that last night, everyone from the Blue Light Octopus clan went out to kill all the arrogant Shangguan in the city. They were surprised at first, and then overjoyed. No one liked it. Those so-called Shangguan don't like them at all, but they can't do anything about them. Although the Blue-Light Octopus Clan has had countless conflicts with those people, the person standing behind those people is the Dragon King, so the Blue-Light Octopus Clan can't do anything to them. There is no way. This will only make those guys even more arrogant. The people in the city already hate those people deeply, but there is no way but to swallow their anger.
