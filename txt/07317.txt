c7317 Yaksha god

Zhao Hai looked at the Yaksha clan members who were still charging, and turned to Wen Wenhai and said: "Go, send the order, concentrate all the Skyfire, attack those floating islands, and at the same time release iron balls and giant beasts, prepare to resist For those floating islands to charge, let all the masters prepare at the same time. If the Yasha clan dares to charge at this time, it means that they will fight hard, and their masters will also come out, and we must be prepared."

Wen Wenhai responded and immediately asked the staff on the side to give the order. Then he turned to look at Zhao Hai. Zhao Hai looked at Wen Wenhai and said solemnly: "You should also be prepared, if the opponent's master takes action. , you also want to take action, I won't move for now, because I feel that there seems to be a more powerful guy behind the Yasha clan. That guy hasn't taken action yet. If he doesn't take action, I won't take action. I want to Wait for that guy, he is not easy to deal with."

When Wen Wenhai heard what Zhao Hai said, Wen Wenhai couldn't help but be startled, and then his expression turned serious. He had always felt a little strange before, why Zhao Hai said he would take action before, but when it came to the battlefield, Zhao Hai kept arranging them. He thought Zhao Hai didn't want to take action, but he never said when he wanted to take action. Now when he heard what Zhao Hai said, he realized that it wasn't that Zhao Hai didn't want to take action, but that he still wanted to take action. Waiting, waiting for the more powerful master of the Yasha clan, no wonder.

But at this moment, a sudden and extremely powerful momentum rose into the sky behind the Yasha clan. This momentum was extremely powerful, as if a god was awakening. He suddenly woke up and opened his eyes. He glanced around, only to find that he was surrounded by a group of monkeys. Those monkeys dared to touch his clothes. He was angry, and the pressure of the gods emerged directly from his body and directed towards those monkeys. The monkey pressed over.

As soon as they felt this momentum, everyone in the Yasha clan was stunned, and then they couldn't help but look back. Although they felt this pressure, they felt a trace of warmth from this pressure. , what does this mean? This shows that the person who unleashed this coercion has a slight fondness for them and belongs to their group.

This made the Yaksha clan's morale even stronger. They immediately cheered and rushed towards the Blood Killing Sect. At this time, the Blood Killing Sect's sky-full of fire and energy beasts still attacked the Yaksha clan's army. , especially those filled with sky fire, attacked those floating islands.

"Huh!" A cold snort came, and with this cold snort, the sky full of fire and energy giant beasts all changed, and those energy giant beasts seemed to have been punched hard. , directly turned into a ball of white light and disappeared, but those sky-filled fires directly turned in one direction and flew back in the direction of the Blood Killing Sect.

Seeing this situation, the people of the Yaksha clan blew louder, and the Lion Heart Emperor said with tears in his eyes: "Yaksha God has not given up on us, he has not given up on us, Yaksha God has appeared, come on, Kill all the monks." Following his voice, everyone on Lion Heart Island cheered and rushed forward.

At this moment, those Man Dahuo who flew back all stopped, and then disappeared directly. Then a voice came from the direction of the Blood Killing Sect: "Hahaha, friend, I'm waiting for you. It's been a long time, but you finally came out, hahaha, I thought you would come out later, it seems I really overestimated your patience." The voice was flat, nothing special. It feels like chatting with a friend. When you laugh, it just gives people a pleasant feeling, not particularly exciting.

But the disciples of the Blood Killing Sect were all stunned when they heard this voice. Then they all cheered because they recognized that this voice belonged to Zhao Hai. They had all heard Zhao Hai say He said, they know Zhao Hai's voice, they will not hear it wrong, the person who speaks is Zhao Hai.

As soon as they heard what Zhao Hai said, they immediately understood that everything was under Zhao Hai's control. In other words, the opponent, a master, had also expected Zhao Hai's actions, so what else could they have? I was so worried. When I thought of this, the disciples of the Blood Killing Sect couldn't help but become even more excited. They all cheered and began to charge forward.

At this time, an old voice came from behind the Yaksha clan: "Who are you? Why are you attacking the Yaksha world? You dare to kill so many of my children, I will definitely take your life." Although this voice was very strange, He is old, but he carries an indescribable majesty, as if the words he speaks are holy teachings that cannot be refuted.

"I'm the leader of the Blood Killing Sect, Zhao Hai. Why don't you come out and meet me." Following this voice, everyone saw a figure appear in the sky. This person was wearing red clothes and looked very ordinary, with a smile on his face. With a smile on his face, there was nothing special about him. He just stood in the sky so easily, without any power at all.

But when the disciples of the Blood Killing Sect saw Zhao Hai appear, they all cheered. It had been a long time since they had seen Zhao Hai take action in person. In their eyes, Zhao Hai was an invincible existence. With a god-like existence, no one is Zhao Hai's opponent. As long as Zhao Hai takes action, there is no enemy that cannot be defeated.

But the people of the Yaksha Clan were all looking at Zhao Hai with extremely hateful eyes. They knew that this master was the real enemy of the Yaksha Clan. As long as they killed this person, the Yaksha Clan would win. There are many people from the Yasha clan who are already ready to take action. They are preparing to take action first and take care of Zhao Hai.

Zhao Hai just glanced at the people of the Yaksha clan, without saying a word, and then withdrew his gaze, still looking at the back of the Yaksha clan, as if waiting for the arrival of an old friend. But all the Yasha clan who were swept by his gaze felt it. Their whole bodies tensed up, as if they felt that two sharp swords shot out from Zhao Hai's eyes and pierced directly into their souls. In the middle, the icy chill seemed to make them feel that death was coming. Several Yashas who had wanted to take action before even spurted out a mouthful of blood, but they were already overwhelmed by the power released by Zhao Hai's glance. , I was so stressed that I vomited blood.

At this moment, a sound of dragon roar came, and then a huge black shadow was seen flying slowly towards the front from behind the Yasha clan. The speed of the black shadow was very fast. In the blink of an eye, that The black shadow had already arrived about a mile in front of Zhao Hai and stopped abruptly.

When the black shadow stopped, everyone could really see what the black shadow was. The black shadow turned out to be a black dragon, and on the back of the black dragon, there was a person sitting. This person was very tall. Tall, he wears black armor all over his body. He is about ten feet tall, but he looks very thin. His armor is also very special. His armor seems to have good defense, but it does not protect the whole body. Wrapped up, the two arms and head are all exposed.

His head looks like a person, but a little different. On his head is nearly ten feet of messy hair, which is blowing in the wind. His face is all blue, his eyes are deep-set, and there are two horns. His teeth protrude from his lower jaw and shoot up to the sky. The whole person looks half-human and half-ghost-like.

He was holding a halberd in his hand, his eyes were gleaming fiercely, and with his tall figure, he was standing on the opposite side of Zhao Hai. As the two sides turned against each other, Zhao Hai's momentum seemed to be instantly outweighed. , at least in terms of selling portraits, Zhao Hai is the kind of person who is inconspicuous when thrown into a crowd, but that Yaksha is so ugly that people can remember him at a glance.

The man looked at Zhao Hai, opened his mouth, and said in a deep voice: "Are you Zhao Hai? I really didn't realize that you look so gentle, but your thoughts are so vicious, you actually want to destroy us Yaksha Clan, do you really dare to think that I, the Yaksha Clan, are all made of mud?"

Zhao Hai looked at the Yaksha, smiled slightly and said: "Your Excellency, you don't tell lies in front of real people. I heard someone below called you Yaksha God. So you are the god of the Yaksha clan? And it seems that you are also a god who doesn't know People who have lived for many years, you should know what is going on with the Yasha clan. To put it nicely, you are guarding this interface here. To put it badly, you are imprisoned here, and you The final fate is like this. If we don't come, sooner or later, other people will come here. This is your fate. What are you dissatisfied with? Why don't you accept the arrangement of fate? "

"What a bullshit fate. If it were you, would you accept such a fate? We, the Yasha clan, are also a race. Why can't we fight for ourselves? We want to change our destiny, we want to leave here, and we want to live an upright life. In this world, we don’t want to be the targets of others’ trials. We don’t want to, and we never want to.” The God of Yasha roared. As he spoke, he looked at Zhao Hai with an extremely hateful look, both eyes I want to spit out fire.

Zhao Hai looked at his appearance and couldn't help but sigh softly and said: "There is nothing we can do about this. The person who left you in this space has left. You were killed by another more evil force." Controlled, so we must destroy you, destroy you forever."

"If you want to destroy my Yaksha clan, you have to ask your colleagues for permission, and more importantly, see if you can beat the halberd in my hand. Okay, I don't want to talk so much nonsense to you. It's useless for people like you to say anything. In your opinion, we people are evil and should be eliminated. What else is there to say? I want to see the truth. I really want to see it. , can you really destroy us?" After saying that, the God of Yaksha raised the halberd in his hand and pointed it directly at Zhao Hai. Zhao Hai looked at the other party and couldn't help but sigh. He knew that this A war is inevitable, so there is nothing more to say, just fight.
