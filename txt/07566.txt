Bazu felt his eyes flash, and the next moment he found that he had arrived at another place. This was also the sea, surrounded by seaweed. You could also see very beautiful corals, and some small fish and shrimps, right there. Swimming freely, this place looks even more beautiful than the Shenlong Sea Kingdom.

Just when Bazu was looking around, a figure suddenly swam over from a distance. When the figure got closer, Bazu and the others discovered that it was not a person, but an octopus, and it was similar to them. It turned out to be an octopus with blue patterns on its body. The patterns on the octopus were also shining and looked very beautiful.

Just when Bazu was in a daze, the octopus moved, and the next moment he had turned into a human. This was a real human, not an octopus, and his head was not that of an octopus, but An ordinary human head, he is very handsome, with some blue tattoos on his face. If you look carefully, you will find that those tattoos can flash and flash. This is a characteristic of the blue octopus family.

After the man appeared in human form, he cupped his fists at Bazu and the others and said, "Lanyu has met all fellow Taoists. Welcome to our Blood Killing Sect. From today on, you are also members of our Blood Killing Sect. I am The sect has sent you to fetch you, please come with me." After saying this, he made an invitation gesture on one side of his body.

Bazu and the others hurriedly swam down from the magic circle, and then another group of people immediately appeared on the magic circle. Lan Yu smiled at Bazu and the others and said: "They still have people to support them. Everyone, please follow me." After that, he turned around and swam forward. The Eight Legs looked at him curiously, but they also followed him and swam forward together.

After swimming for a while, Bazu said with some curiosity: "Bazu, I have met fellow Taoist Lan. Fellow Daoist Lan, are you also from our blue-light octopus clan?" This is what Bazu is most curious about. They are members of the blue-light octopus clan. , he knew them all, but he had never seen this blue jade, and all the members of the Blue Light Octopus clan were surnamed Ba, and there was no one named Lan at all, so he could be sure that this blue jade must not be the blue light from Shenlonghai Kingdom. The octopus family.

When Lan Yu heard what he said, she couldn't help but smile slightly and said: "Fellow Eight-Legged Taoist, you're welcome. I know your situation. In my opinion, we should be of the same race. It's just because we live in different places. The names are also different, you call yourselves the Blue Light Octopus Clan, we call ourselves the Blue Striped Octopus Clan, but they are actually the same."

Bazu felt that Lan Yu's statement was very reasonable, so he nodded to Lan Yu and said: "Fellow Daoist Lan is right. I think we should be of the same race, but we have just joined the bloodline." The sect has been killed, please ask fellow Taoist Lan to take care of it in the future." This is what Bazu is most worried about. He actually doesn't know what is going on with the blood-killing sect. People always have some fear of the unknown, so he I want to have a good relationship with Lan Yu.

When Lan Yu heard what he said, she couldn't help but smile and said: "Fellow Taoist Eight Legs, you don't need to be so polite. In fact, you don't have to worry about anything. The reason why I call you fellow Taoist now is because even though you have entered the Blood Killing Sect, you can still be considered a Blood Killing Sect." You are a disciple of the Blood Killing Sect, but after all, you have not officially obtained the status of a disciple of the Blood Killing Sect. In the future, when you get the status of a disciple of the Blood Killing Sect, then we can no longer refer to each other as Taoist friends, and we can call each other senior fellow apprentice. , by that time, they will be able to enjoy all the benefits of the Blood Killing Sect, so you don’t have to be so polite."

Hearing what Lan Yu said, Ba Zu was slightly startled, and then he couldn't help but salute Lan Yu and said: "Thank you so much, Fellow Daoist Lan. We have just joined the Blood Killing Sect and don't understand anything yet. Please invite Fellow Daoist Lan in the future." Please remind us more, lest we violate any of the Blood Killing Sect's taboos, which would be bad."

Lan Yu said with a smile: "You're welcome, Fellow Taoist Bazu, we're here." After saying that, Lan Yu pushed forward, Bazu and the others looked forward, and couldn't help but be stunned for a moment, because what appeared in front of them turned out to be a very large building. It's a big city, but the strange thing is that they clearly didn't see this city before, but now they can clearly see this city, and this city is still very close to them, almost right in front of their eyes. This surprised them all.

Lan Yu glanced at Bazu and the others, smiled slightly and said: "This is a city prepared for you. Of course, there were many people living in the city originally, but the city was later expanded, and there is a kind of light distortion on the periphery of the city. The phantom array is here. This phantom array does not have much effect. It means that people cannot see the city outside a certain range, so you have never seen this city before. Everyone. , please come with me." After saying that, he swam towards the city first.

Naturally, Bazu and the others had no choice but to listen. They all followed Lan Yu and swam towards the city. As they swam in, they looked at the city curiously. The walls of this city were all made of a black stone. , it seems that it has been built for a long time, and there are still some water plants growing on it. It looks simple and natural, with a unique flavor.

When Bazu and the others entered the city, they were even more surprised. They saw many houses in the city. These houses were all very beautiful in style. There were aquatic plants growing everywhere, and some small fish were swimming freely. The houses are moving, and these houses are just like the houses in their Pearl City. Some are big and some are small. Although they are not divided into so many districts like their Pearl City, they still have a sense of nature. Each house They are well-proportioned and pleasing to the eye.

After Lan Yu led Bazu into the city, he smiled at Bazu and the others and said: "Now that you have joined the Blood Killing Sect, naturally you cannot live in a big courtyard like before, with people of the same race. Come on, there are many rooms in this city. You can live in them. Remember, you can live in any room with no one in it. But there is a special feature in this city. Rooms with no people in them are all rooms. The door is open. In a room with people, the door of the room is closed, and there is usually a magic circle protecting it, so as long as the door is closed, you cannot enter the room, no matter whether there is anyone or not. Now you You can choose a house by yourself, as long as it is suitable for you to live in, you can choose it."

When Lan Yu said this, Bazu just nodded. He knew that after joining the Blood Killer, their Blue Light Octopus clan would no longer be the lords of a city, and those privileges would naturally be gone, so for Lan Yu They understood what he said, so he greeted him directly and they all went to choose a house together.

Just when they were choosing a house, the second batch of disciples entered the room at once, followed by the third batch, and the fourth batch. People from Pearl City all entered the city one by one. The city is very big, and even with so many people entering at once, it doesn't feel crowded at all. It's just because everyone has just entered, and everyone can choose their own house, so it seems a bit chaotic.

Not long after, Bafang and the others also entered the city. Bafang and the others also looked around curiously. After looking around, Bafang opened his mouth and said to the old Jiuling standing next to him: "Sir, it seems that this city It was specially prepared for us. I really didn’t expect that there are sea tribes in the Blood Killing Sect, and there are also sea tribes like our Blue Light Octopus.”

Old Jiuling glanced around, and finally sighed and said: "Yeah, I didn't expect that there are quite a lot of sea people in the Blood Killing Sect, and it seems that their combat effectiveness is not low, and this city, it seems, although It's very quaint, but in some places, you can still tell that this city must have been built not long ago, but it doesn't look like it was built specifically for you."

Bafang shook his head and said with a smile: "Sir, this city is really built specifically for us. Although there are some seaweeds on the city walls, those seaweeds have one characteristic, that is, they are all the same color, and It looks very delicate. Such seaweed must have been planted just now by people from the Blood Slaughter Sect for the sake of beauty, so this city must have been built not long ago and was specially built for us."

Jiuling Lao was stunned, and then a blue-striped octopus who was leading the way smiled and said: "Elder Bafang is right, this city was really just built, but those seaweeds are not just for appearance, they are actually food." , many creatures in the sea need to eat food, and those seaweeds are very good food."

When he heard what he said, Jiuling Lao could not help but be stunned, and then he said with some confusion: "But there are not a lot of seaweeds in the whole city. Is this seaweed enough to eat?" Jiuling Lao knew something. In fact, there are very few elixirs in the Blood Killing Sect, and the disciples all rely on food for training, so all the disciples of the Blood Killing Sect eat.

In the Shenlong Sea Kingdom, although people of all races in the Shenlong Sea Kingdom can also eat, they don't eat a lot. They are still made to absorb spiritual energy. However, some sea people are born with big stomachs, even if they are They didn't eat much, but they didn't eat much, so when they saw the water plants growing in the city and on the city walls, Old Jiuling felt that they didn't have enough to eat.

The disciple of the blue-striped octopus clan smiled and said: "Don't worry, elder. In fact, we have planted some seaweed in the room just for everyone to eat. One of the characteristics of the seaweed here is that it grows very fast and has aura." It's quite enough, and there's also a natural energy circle here, so the seaweed here is enough for us to eat." As he said this, he picked a leaf from a seaweed next to him. , put it in his mouth, but as soon as he picked off a piece of mirin, the seaweed immediately grew another piece of mirin. It didn't take long in total, and the speed was very fast. The blue-striped octopus hadn't taken this piece yet. After the leaves are all eaten, the second odorifera has already grown, which shows how fast this seaweed grows.

When they saw this situation, Bafang and the others were very surprised and curious. They all walked to the seaweed tree and reached out to pick a leaf. The leaf immediately grew back, and then he picked it off again. One piece, and the leaves grew back immediately. After picking several pieces in total, the leaves would still grow back, which made them even more surprised.
