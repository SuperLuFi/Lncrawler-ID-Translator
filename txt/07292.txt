c7292 counterattack

When Chang Jun heard what Wen Wenhai said, he was also surprised, and then he immediately said: "Yes, we really should inform them, let's inform them now." Chang Jun knew very well that now all the mounts of the disciples of the Blood Killing Sect can be It is the incarnation outside the body, where it will be affected by the power of the law.

The power of law affects the power of the magic circle in the magic weapon. Therefore, the more magic magic weapons there are, the greater the impact will be. For example, the Blood Killing Battle Fort uses many magic circles, so the impact will be very serious. It's huge, and its power is less than half of its original power, but if it's a disciple's magical weapon, it's different. Although it will be affected, it won't be that big.

Wen Wenhai nodded, and then said in a deep voice: "Activate the public notification system." A staff officer immediately responded and activated the public notification system directly. He was smart, and activated the secret public notification system. If it were an ordinary public system, it would be useless at this time.

When the staff officer signaled to Wen Wenhai that it was okay, Wen Wenhai then said: "All disciples of the Blood Killing Sect, listen up. All disciples of the Blood Killing Sect, listen up. We are making an announcement now because the power of the Shadow Clan's Law has been strengthened. Interference, so the magic weapons of all disciples may be affected to varying degrees. All disciples must pay attention to their puppet mounts. If the situation is not good, take back the puppet mount immediately. Remember, if the situation is not right, put it away immediately. Puppet mount.”

After the notification, Wen Wenhai took a deep breath, and then said in a deep voice: "The power of the Shadow Clan's laws, combined with such a powerful Yaksha, is indeed more difficult to deal with. Even if we face the Shadow Clan's army, At that time, I'm afraid this is the case, which shows how difficult these Yaksha are to deal with."

Chang Jun shook his head and said: "Not only that, we have never been like this even when facing the army of the Shadow Clan. It is really difficult to deal with, because the combat power of these Yaksha seems to be stronger than the ordinary army of the Shadow Clan. Above, it seems that if we get to the next interface, we must be more careful. If the power of the Shadow Clan Law here is connected to the power of the Shadow Clan Law on the next interface, they will definitely be on the next interface. Make comprehensive adjustments and suppress us right from the start. In that case, it will be even more difficult for us to win that interface."

Wen Wenhai nodded and said: "Now we can only wait until the next interface starts to take a look at the situation. Sure enough, the disciples were greatly affected by the power of the Shadow Clan's laws, and they all put away their puppet mounts. It seems that it is impossible to overwhelm the Shadow Clan army directly."

Chang Jun said in a deep voice: "Have the Sky-Swallowing Net been released? We must break the opponent's forbidden air formation as soon as possible, otherwise it will slow down our attack speed." Chang Jun also discovered that there was a situation on the front line. , the disciples of the Blood Killing Sect have all put away their mounts, and now they are engaging in close combat with the Yasha clan. The formations of both sides are now in a bit of chaos, and the fighting is very lively.

But they are fighting on the ground now. Even if the battle line is very long, there are not many troops that can really play a role. The front row is fighting, but the people behind them cannot intervene at all. But at this moment, countless arrows were shot from behind the Yaksha clan's army. These arrows were very long and powerful. However, the targets of these arrows were not the disciples in the front row, but the disciples in the front row. It's the Blood Killing Sect army behind them.

When they saw these arrows, Wen Wenhai and Chang Jun were both stunned, and then they couldn't help but smile bitterly. Wen Wenhai even said: "I really didn't expect that such a primitive attack method would be used here. It's very effective, it's really unbelievable." He was really right, this kind of violence, in their opinion, is indeed very primitive.

Chang Jun also smiled bitterly, and then said: "Anyway, the opponent has already used this trick. If we don't fight back, we may be at a disadvantage. Let's send a team of planters over and just use bread." Trees to deal with them." Chang Jun did not expect that the other party would use this method to deal with them, but he also suddenly thought that now their planters are ready to go to the battlefield, so why not take advantage of it? He didn't think , the war plants produced by their plant masters would be inferior to the masters, so he directly suggested it to Wen Wenhai.

Wen Wenhai thought for a while, nodded directly and said: "Okay, let's do it. Someone, come and inform Hu Wei and ask her to send a team of planters to join the battle and get more bread trees on the front line to give to the enemy. A lesson, by the way, I would like to ask Cang Ming how the situation in their land is going." Immediately, a staff officer responded and went down to send a letter.

After Wen Wenhai finished speaking, he turned to look at the projection and said in a deep voice: "I didn't want to use those war plants at first, but I didn't expect that they would be used so soon. These Yashas are really difficult to deal with, so Simple weapons actually let them play with them, it's amazing, it's really amazing."

Chang Jun nodded and said: "Of course. If these Yashas were so easy to deal with, we wouldn't have to go to such a big trouble and have dealt with them long ago." As soon as he said this, he saw When a staff officer came over, Chang Jun knew that the other party must have something to do. He immediately nodded to the staff officer and signaled those staff members to speak up if they had something to say.

The staff officer was not polite and saluted the two of them and said: "Elder Wen, Elder Chang, and Elder Cang have sent letters. They have also encountered enemies underground. Dafang is fighting a war, and now there is a stalemate. No one can do anything to the other, but They also don’t have time to help the ground troops.”

Chang Jun nodded, and then said in a deep voice: "Okay, you go down. If there is any news from Cangming, I will report it immediately." The staff officer responded, turned around and left. After the staff officer left, Chang Jun breathed a sigh of relief and said: "To be honest, in my opinion, this is definitely a good thing. We don't expect them to be of any help or to take advantage of the other party's territory." It’s already quite remarkable that all the Yashas have been held back.”

Wen Wenhai said solemnly: "Yes, the underground matter has been solved, and the rest will be left to our ground forces. If we can't even take down a Yaksha clan, then we people will be too useless." As they spoke, they saw on the projection, towering trees suddenly growing out of some positions behind the Blood Killing Sect army.

After these big trees grew up, they immediately threw huge fruits directly into the army of the Yaksha clan. Each of these fruits was the size of a watermelon and looked round. These fruits fell to the Yaksha clan. After entering the army of the clan, it exploded immediately, and countless seeds as big as soybeans flew around. This kind of attack was a large-scale attack. Within one or two hundred square meters, as long as it was hit by the seeds of this kind of fruit, If hit, you will be injured even if you don't die.

What's even more frightening is that if those seeds really stay in your body, they will immediately absorb that person's energy, grow out quickly, and grow into a big tree again, and these big trees will shoot out more energy. There are many fruits, and the fruits can explode at once and shoot out more seeds. Such an attack is really surprising.

Wen Wenhai looked at the large forest that suddenly appeared in the projection, where the Yasha clan was. He couldn't help but reveal a smile on his face, and then said in a deep voice: "Speaking of which, the combat effectiveness of these plant masters is really quite good. It’s really rare to kill so many people.”

Chang Jun said: "This method is very good when used in such large-scale battles, but if it is a one-on-one battle, it will be a little worse. In a one-on-one battle, in fact, the plant master We are still at a huge disadvantage because they cannot become the main battle force, and there is nothing we can do about it, but with them in the sect, it will be much easier for us."

Wen Wenhai nodded and said: "Yes, with them, we are indeed a lot more relaxed. Forget it, let's not talk about this anymore. How long will it take for them to react if we use plant masters to deal with the Yasha clan now? , can you think of a way to defeat the Zhishi attack?" This is what Wen Wenhai is most concerned about.

But at this time, the two of them saw that the trees in the projection were disappearing in large numbers. When they saw this situation, they were both stunned. They didn't know what happened. How did the enemy make those bread trees disappear? , disappeared in large numbers. Wen Wenhai immediately said to the staff officer: "Quickly, write a letter to Elder Gu Yuanzheng and ask him what happened on the front line and why all those trees disappeared."

The staff officer immediately responded, and then went directly to write a letter to Gu Yuanzheng. He was also very curious. He wanted to know how those trees had just been used, so how could they be cracked open? To be honest, he still hasn't figured out the most effective way to crack those tree attacks.

In fact, the matter started when the plant masters started to attack. Hu Wei was very excited when he got Wen Wenhai's order. Their plant masters had always been very low-key in the Blood Killing Sect. They didn't want to be low-key. No, because not many people noticed them, and they really didn't have much sense of presence. Only Hu Wei had some sense of presence, or because of Zhang Hongliang, the other plant masters didn't have a strong sense of presence.

It was not until Laura and the others later established the Spiritual Planting Hall that they gathered all the planting masters together and established a hall. Only then did they have some sense of existence. However, their research was mainly focused on improving the Blood Killing Sect. Most of them are edible spiritual plants, so they still don’t have much sense of existence. After all, people who eat don’t need to know the farmers who grow those grains and vegetables.

However, they gathered together to conduct research, and indeed they achieved considerable results. For example, the current Bread Tree, Babel Vine, and other planters used for fighting in the past have all been improved. Even the Gangfeng Tree Clan, they They have also been improved. After all, this is the specialty of their planters, so Lingzhitang has been developing well in recent times, and it has actually launched several new products, such as Cuscuta, improved Babel Vine, Improved bread tree, improved super tree, etc., these are their new products.
