Gu Yuanzheng naturally saw what Ling Jian and the others were doing, but now Ling Jian and the others were doing this on the territory of the Yaksha clan, and did not go to the Blood Killing Sect to attack the bread trees there, so even if they It is also very difficult to deal with Ling Jian and the others. He will not take the risk now and let the masters of the Blood Killing Sect enter the Yaksha Army. The law suppression in the Yaksha Army is even more serious. The masters of the Blood Killing Sect enter there. , the strength cannot be brought out 100%, and with the help of other Yaksha armies, the masters of the Blood Killing Sect will be folded there. Naturally, he cannot do this, so he can only keep the situation as it is. Report to Wen Wenhai and tell Wen Wenhai that it is really not appropriate to attack the masters of the Yaksha tribe now, but he is also prepared. If the masters of the Yaksha tribe really dare to attack them, they will not be polite. .

After receiving the report from the ancient expedition, Wen Wenhai was very impatient. He also knew very well that they really had no good way to suppress this kind of law. Although they had the Wheel of Law, the Wheel of Law There is also a limit. If the opponent suppresses it too hard, the Wheel of Law will not be of much use.

The most important reason is that the power of law of the Yasha clan is actually the power of law of the Shadow clan. The power of law of the Shadow clan is alive, but the power of their law is dead. Although the blood is now The Killing Sect has its own power of law, but their power of law is actually based on the power of law of the world of cultivation. Therefore, the power of their law is also the same as the power of law of the world of cultivation. It's the same, it's dead, just like a computer program. It can only operate according to a certain program, but it can never truly become a living thing.

It is precisely because of this that the Blood Killing Sect has always been at a disadvantage in terms of law suppression. The Shadow Clan's power of law can be used to suppress them, but they cannot use the power of law to suppress the Shadow Clan. One is alive and the other is dead. This is the main reason.

Of course Wen Wenhai and the others knew this situation, so the battles of the Blood Killing Sect had always been based on offensive defense. What is offensive defense? In fact, it is very simple, just advance steadily. When attacking, don't be anxious, take it slowly step by step, occupy a place, and completely make that place theirs. They just keep oppressing the enemy, and then let the enemy If they take the initiative to attack them, they are destroying or repelling the enemy, destroying the enemy's effective strength, and destroying the enemy step by step.

One of the main reasons for doing this is to suppress the laws of the Shadow Clan to a minimum so that the Blood Killing Clan will not suffer such heavy losses. This is the most important thing, so Wen Wenhai does this. Now that the masters of the Yasha clan are operating in their army and have not joined the army of the Blood Killing Sect, they have no good way to deal with those people.

It is impossible to send puppet disciples to attack them. When the puppet disciples enter the army of the Yaksha clan, their strength will be severely compressed. Even if their lives are not in danger, they will never be able to match the masters of the Yaksha clan. The masters of the Blood Killing Sect were sent to fear that they would be in danger, so they could only watch Ling Jian and the others clear out all the bread trees growing there before the Yaksha army came.

Although the bread trees here are still attacking and will still cause a lot of casualties to the enemy, it is really difficult to rely on these bread trees to do anything to the enemy, and Wen Wenhai has no choice. , can only watch, after all, this situation is related to the laws of the entire world of cultivation, and it is not something he can solve.

After Ling Jian and the others cleaned up the bread trees in the Yaksha army, they still wanted to attack the bread trees in the Blood Killing Sect army, but now there were already a lot of bread trees in the Blood Killing Sect army. They are still attacking, and every time they attack, a new forest will be created. If they attack the bread trees among the Blood Killing Sect's army, they will be entangled by the Blood Killing Sect's masters. , The second is that when they attack, more bread trees will appear here in the Yaksha army, and their losses will not be small at that time. It is precisely because of this that Ling Jian and the others are afraid to attack. When Ling Jian saw this situation, he really didn't know what to say. Finally, he thought about it and decided to tell Xie Gufang directly about this matter to see what Xie Gufang's opinion was.

When Xie Gufang saw Ling Jian, he was a little surprised, but he still said: "Old Ling, what's the matter? Are those trees where the Blood Killing Sect's army is inconvenient to attack?" Xie Gufang had already talked to Ling Jian before He said that after destroying the bread trees in their army, he would directly attack the bread trees in the Blood Killing Sect's army. Now that Ling Jian did not attack, it meant that there was a difficulty, so he was so nervous.

Ling Jian nodded and said: "It's not convenient. The trees of the Blood Killing Sect are planted relatively far back. If you want to attack their trees, you have to rush into their army. But the Blood Killing Sect There are also masters, and when we reach their army, the effect of divine power will be reduced a lot, which will have a great impact on us. I am afraid of being entangled by them. If we are really entangled by them, it will be dangerous. , it will cause great losses if not done properly, and as you can see, they have planted too many trees, and they are still planting them now. Even if we clean them up in the past, it will take a lot of time. This period of time , their trees will keep attacking, and soon there will be a large forest here, and our casualties will be even greater, so it is really not suitable to attack them now."

Hearing what Ling Jian said, Xie Gufang also nodded. Then he glanced in the direction of the Blood Killing Sect and said solemnly: "Their trees are really abominable, but we can't clean them up." Fall, our losses are not small. It seems that they are retaliating against us. We used strong weapons to attack them, and they used this kind of tree to attack us. Although our magic circle is not sensitive to the effects of this kind of tree. Those fruits also have a certain effect, but the effect is not very great, which is why there is such a big loss. It seems that the Blood Killing Sect still has many trump cards."

Ling Jian nodded and said: "Yes, the Blood Killing Sect must have a lot of trump cards. We must be more careful. Do you think it would be better if we attack their army directly? Their army These are not those puppets anymore, but their real disciples."

Ling Jian has no good solution now. Their personal strength is indeed very strong, but now they have invested tens of billions of disciples in the battle. With so many people fighting, their personal strength can only be fully exerted. The effect is very low, which is why he is so impatient. He has never thought that there are times when a person's strength is strong and it doesn't work. He has never encountered this kind of thing before.

Xie Gufang shook his head and said: "No, it is not suitable to attack their army directly now. Now we are at a stalemate. This situation is actually what I want to see. As long as the people of the Blood Killing Sect can be killed in a short time, If we can't really break through our defense within the time limit, then we'll consider it a win, just wait, don't be in a hurry."

Ling Jian responded, turned around and left. He also wanted to ensure that the Yaksha clan's army would not appear in the woods of bread trees and could not always follow Xie Gufang. Xie Gufang faced this situation. Naturally, he understood it very well, so he didn't say anything.

At this time, Wu Litian also came to Xie Gufang's side. He also looked at the battlefield and said solemnly: "I just calculated that the situation on the battlefield is actually not very good now. Our casualties are higher than those of the Blood Killing Sect." The casualties will be greater. Although our Yasha clan has very strong fighting power, the equipment of the Blood Killer Sect is really good. Their armors have very strong defensive power, and the weapons they use are also very good. We can't compare to these. So in this case, our casualties will be greater than theirs, and if this continues, we are afraid we will still be defeated."

When Xie Gufang heard what Wu Litian said, he couldn't help but be stunned, and then he said in a deep voice: "There is nothing we can do about it. I have actually made some mental preparations. The equipment of the Blood Killing Sect is really good. We can't compare, we will lose, but as long as we can hold on until the defense line is built, then we will win. I don't think the Blood Killing Sect can always maintain this intensity of attack. It won’t work if there are many disciples behind them.”

Wu Litian sighed and didn't say anything. He also knew that what Xie Gufang said was right. In fact, he had already been mentally prepared for it. But when the facts were placed in front of him, he still felt a little uncomfortable in his heart. Uncomfortable, Wu Litian could only sigh in the end and stand there watching the situation on the battlefield.

At this time, four hours had passed since the war. The casualties on both sides were not small. However, the intensity of the Blood Killing Sect's attack had not dropped at all. This made Xie Gufang's Wu Litian a little anxious. If the Blood Killing Sect continued Attacking with this intensity will put a lot of pressure on them.

At this moment, Wu Litian's face suddenly changed, and Xie Gufang's face also changed. He couldn't help but cursed: "Damn it, these bastards from the Blood Killing Sect, do they want to keep attacking like this? You really deserve to die." The reason why he cursed like this was because he discovered that the attacking troops of the Blood Killing Sect had already begun to rotate. A group of new disciples began to rotate with the ongoing disciples. See It seems that this offensive intensity will be maintained forever.

And this is exactly what Xie Gufang and the others don't want to see. They know very well that if the Blood Killing Sect continues to attack them with this intensity, the time they can sustain will only be shorter. Although they They can also rotate, but an attack of this intensity will bring them greater losses. This is not what they want to see, but they have no choice but to accept this attack.
