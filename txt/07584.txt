Bafang's current appearance is just that of an ordinary octopus. Although it is a bit larger, and it is clear at first glance that it has spiritual intelligence and has been trained, but to the people of the Hai tribe, this is nothing. There are also many sea creatures that have been eaten by those who have opened their spiritual intelligence and practiced it. Therefore, those swordfish are looking at all directions with malicious intentions. They are definitely not just trying to tease him, but they really want to eat him. Drop him.

Bafang glanced at the swordfish, then coughed lightly, and then he moved his hand, and a jade bell appeared in his hand. He used a tentacle to roll up the bell and sent it to a swordfish. In front, he said to the swordfish: "This friend of the swordfish clan has invited me. I have some friendship with the elder of the swordfish clan, Elder Tu Jinbo. This is the token that elder Tu gave me. I would like to see you. Elder Tu, I wonder if you can pass it on for me?" He spoke very politely, because he can't reveal his identity now. Now I am afraid that the entire Shenlonghai Kingdom will know that the Blue Light Octopus clan has betrayed the Shenlonghai Kingdom. Well, if he went directly as his own identity, he would probably be attacked by the Swordfish clan immediately and cause some trouble to Slaughter Bowl.

And if he goes as an ordinary octopus, there will be no problem. There are many ordinary octopuses in the sea. Although the most famous among the octopus family is the blue-light octopus, when it comes to the largest number, it is not Blue Light Octopus, Blue Light Octopus can only be said to be the most famous, so even if Blue Light Octopus betrayed, it does not mean that other octopus clan also betrayed the Shenlonghai Kingdom. After all, although Blue Ray Octopus is an octopus clan, they are not octopuses. The leader of a clan, the Octopus clan has never been unified, so naturally no one will doubt his identity.

When the swordfish heard what Bafang said, they were all stunned. Then they all glanced at the Yuling, and finally looked at each other. No one dared to say anything now. They knew very well that Tu Jinbo was indeed them. The elder of the swordfish clan, and a very high-status elder at that, if this octopus really has a relationship with the elder Tu Jinbo, and they offend this octopus, it will not be a good thing for them.

The reason why they did not doubt Bafang's words was because the Sailfish clan had a habit. Every adult member of the Sailfish clan had to leave the clan and travel throughout the Shenlong Sea Kingdom. In the process, they might They will come into contact with a lot of people and make a lot of friends, and this process sometimes takes several years, sometimes even more than ten years, so in this process, what kind of people are they really like as swordfish people? They may meet their friends, but they still remember that one of their elders made friends with a scale shrimp that had no attack power when he was traveling before, so Elder Tu Jinbo made friends with an octopus. There is nothing strange about being friends.

A swordfish glanced at Bafang, then took the jade bell handed over by Bafang, and said to Bafang: "Please wait a moment, I will report it right away." After saying that, he turned around and swam towards the army of the swordfish clan. It passed by and disappeared in a blink of an eye, but the other swordfish still stood there, looking in all directions.

Bafang was not nervous. The jade bell he took out was indeed a token of Tu Jinbo. When Tu Jinbo was traveling abroad, he was seriously injured. It was he who saved Tu Jinbo's life and became friends with Tu Jinbo. My friend, when Tu Jinbo left, he gave the jade bell to him as a token for the two of them. The person who injured Tu Jinbo had a special identity, so Tu Jinbo never gave it to him. Since this matter has been mentioned before, others will naturally not know about it. The same goes for Bafang. He has not told this matter out, so others will naturally not know about it. He has an old relationship with Tu Jinbo.

Bafang believed that Tu Jinbo would definitely come to see him. Even if Tu Jinbo knew that he had betrayed the Shenlonghai Kingdom, he would still come to see him, because Tu Jinbo was a very loyal person. We haven’t seen each other for a long time, but we communicate from time to time and our relationship has always been very good.

Sure enough, after a while, two swordfish swam straight towards them. At a glance, they saw that the swordfish swimming in front was Tu Jinbo, because Tu Jinbo still had injuries on his body. The injury was quite special, it was on his dorsal fin. Under normal circumstances, it would not be easy to recover from the injury.

Tu Jinbo also saw Bafang. When he saw Bafang's appearance, he was stunned for a moment. Then he immediately understood that this must be Bafang's disguise, but he also knew that with Bafang's current identity, if he didn't disguise If so, it would be really difficult to do it here in the Shenlonghai Kingdom, so he understood Bafang's approach very well.

He swam in front of Bafang, glanced at Bafang, and then laughed loudly and said: "Hahahaha, I really didn't expect that I would meet you here. We haven't seen each other for a long time. Look at your appearance. , you are living a pretty good life. I have told you a long time ago that I asked you to live on the territory of our swordfish clan, but you don’t listen and insist on wandering outside by yourself. But it seems that you are living a pretty good life. , I feel relieved." After saying that, he laughed again.

As soon as Bafang heard what he said, he understood what he meant. This was meant to be told to other members of the Sailfish clan. It was to tell other people of the Sailfish clan that Bafang was not from a famous family, otherwise he would not I won't want to invite him to live in the territory of the swordfish clan.

Bafang felt warm in his heart, and then said with a smile: "Brother Tu, we haven't seen you for a long time. In the end, our Shenlonghai Kingdom is very uneasy. Those of us wandering alone are not having an easy life. I originally wanted to join you, but instead I didn’t expect to meet you here, so I asked to see you rashly, please forgive me.”

The swordfish clan around them all said this, and no one was interested in listening anymore. In fact, because the swordfish clan wanted to travel, there were many sailfish clans living in the territory of the swordfish clan. When they traveled, they made friends. They are some low-status friends. These people will be more or less taken care of on the territory of the swordfish clan and will live a good life. Therefore, they have no doubts about Bafang's current performance and statements. Naturally, they will There is no longer any doubt.

Tu Jinbo took advantage of this opportunity and said with a smile: "Welcome, welcome. Let's go over there. I'm really curious. Where have you been all these years? Tell me carefully. Since I returned to the clan, I have been busy with clan affairs and haven't gone out for a long time." As he said this, he led Bachi to swim to the side, it really looked like two people who hadn't been together for a long time. When we meet old friends, we should be as good as before.

When the two of them arrived at a deserted landowner nearby, Tu Jinbo glanced around, and then whispered to Bafang: "Old man, why did you come here? If those guys know your identity, Then you will be in trouble, the Dragon King has given an order, if you encounter the Blue Light Octopus clan, kill them on the spot without any room for maneuver."

Bafang smiled slightly and said: "I guessed it would be like this, but this time I came to you because I really have something to do. The reason why I came to you was another person's suggestion. I think you should be someone too." Right." Bafang is very clear. Even if he didn't know it before, after the last battle with the crabs and the battle with the swordfish clan, the Dragon King will also receive the news. All the races in Shenlong Sea Kingdom, Everyone should know that he has joined the Blood Killing Sect, and the reason why he joined the Blood Killing Sect is because Elder Jiuling joined the Blood Killing Sect. He believed that Tu Jinbo must also know about this.

Tu Jinbo looked at Bafang and said, "Is it Master Jiuling?" Although he was asking, he was very sure, and it could be heard from his words that he respected Master Jiuling very much. In fact, Jiuling Lao has been the prime minister here in the Shenlonghai Kingdom for many years, and he is kind to all races, because during the years he has been the prime minister, he has always implemented a strategy of recuperation and recuperation for the Shenlonghai Kingdom, so that All races in the Shenlonghai Kingdom have been well rested, and all races have developed very well, which has greatly improved the strength of the Shenlonghai Kingdom. From this point of view, he is really important to the Shenlonghai Kingdom. He is a man of great kindness, and he is also very kind to all races, so people of all races respect him very much when they mention him.

Bafang nodded and said: "It's Lord Jiuling. Lord Jiuling found me and asked me to join the Blood Killing Sect. He said that the current Dragon King is no longer the previous Dragon King. The current Dragon King has been invaded by a force from the outside world. Controlled by consciousness, he was no longer the original Dragon King, and the people of the Blood Killing Sect were chasing that consciousness all the way, and then they entered the Shenlonghai Kingdom. When we fought against the Swordfish Clan’s army before, The sword actually took out a magic weapon. This magic weapon was given to him by the Dragon King and was said to be made of his dragon scales. But in the end, when the magic weapon was broken, it turned into black smoke and disappeared. disappeared, so it can be seen from this point that the people of the Blood Killer Sect did not lie. I came to you this time just to persuade you, the Sailfish Clan, not to follow the Dragon King. Now that we have gone down, the Dragon King has been controlled. There is no benefit in following him, so I want to meet your current clan leader Tu Ying, and I want to persuade him face to face, what do you think?"

Bafang did not intend to hide it from Tu Jinbo, because he knew very well that this matter could not succeed without Tu Jinbo's help, so he told Tu Jinbo what he said, and Tu Jinbo listened to him After saying this, he frowned slightly, and then he looked at Bafang and said: "Old Ba, you should know that this matter concerns our entire swordfish family. I must be careful. What evidence do you have? Does it prove that the Dragon King is indeed controlled by someone?"

When Bafang heard what he said, he couldn't help but smile bitterly and said: "The other party controls the Dragon King and controls him mentally. What other evidence can there be? But Master Jiuling is here. If you want to see him, I can take you there." Meet Lord Jiuling, if you want to go to the Blood Killing Sect, I can also take you to the Blood Killing Sect. Maybe when you get to the Blood Killing Sect, you will believe what I say."
