Zhao Hai looked at Hu Zhi and said with a smile: "Brother, don't be anxious. This time we are not going to kill those guys, but to make them surrender. After all, with our strength, if we really want to confront them head-on, then We will definitely lose, so we can’t be anxious.”

Hu Zhi nodded, then patted Zhao Hai's shoulder hard, and then said in a deep voice: "Okay, I won't mess around. Come on, let everyone rest. We won't fight him until we hit this place." It took a lot of time. Speaking of which, if it hadn't been for a mission, it was such a coincidence that we wouldn't have discovered this place."

Zhao Hai also responded with a smile, and then immediately arranged for everyone to rest. Hu Zhi and the others were already making preparations here. Although there are not many living materials here, there is already a place to live, and the ground here is It is still very dry, so there are still many places for everyone to rest.

Just when everyone was going to rest, Xiao Jiu also came back. Hu Zhi called everyone aside. Hu Zhi looked at Zhao Hai and said: "Brother, where did you get the news this time? Is it true? Reliable?" Hu Zhi still attaches great importance to this matter, because this matter is not a trivial matter, it is a major matter related to the entire Gujian Gang.

Zhao Hai said in a deep voice: "Uncle Liu and Ke Laixuan have sent us news, so I can be sure that this news must be true. Brother, what do you think we should do next?" Zhao Hai Although he already had his own ideas, he still wanted to hear Hu Zhi's ideas.

Hu Zhi said in a deep voice: "Brother, don't you already have an idea? I think your idea is the best. Our ancient sword gang is still a little too weak now. If we enter other towns now, We will face the fate of competing with people in other towns for territory, but this is not what I want to see. After all, our current strength is still somewhat weak, so I think we should do as you say, we Now is not the time to leave Linyuan Town."

Zhao Hai nodded and said: "I think so too, brother, now is not the time for us to leave Linyuan Town, but brother, if we really use this method this time to convince the people of several major stores, I am afraid that we have also formed a grudge with them, they will never let us go, and they will definitely find a way to deal with us, and when the time comes, we will all be in danger."

Hu Zhi nodded. He also understood what Zhao Hai meant, so he said in a deep voice: "I understand what you mean, but we have to do this. So, brothers, I will announce it here today. If something really happens this time, or something happens to me in the future, then the leader of the Gujian Gang will be Brother Zhao Ying, so everyone must listen to him, do you understand?"

No one objected, and they all agreed in unison. Zhao Hai was stunned for a moment. He really didn't expect that Hu Zhi would be so straightforward. Although he had long wanted to be the gang leader, he didn't expect that, Hu Zhi was about to give him the position of gang leader. He quickly said: "Brother, no, let Brother Scarface be the gang leader. I just joined the gang not long ago, now let me be the gang leader." , it’s really inappropriate.”

Hu Zhi shook his head and said: "Brother, there is nothing inappropriate about this. Do you know what we casual cultivators look like? We casual cultivators are like monsters, and those of us who form a gang are like It is a group of monsters. If a group like ours wants to grow bigger, become stronger, and survive, it can only choose a strong leader to lead us. You join the Ancient Sword Gang Although the time is short, everyone sees what you do, so no one will have any objections to you being the leader of the gang. Of course, I am not asking you to be the leader of the gang now, unless I'm dead, otherwise you wouldn't be able to be this gang leader."

Everyone chuckled, and Zhao Hai also smiled and said: "Okay, then I will accept it, but brother, you also know my situation. If something really happens to me in the future, I'm afraid we won't think so." It will be even more difficult to be the leader of this gang, and I’m afraid I won’t be able to take care of you.”

Everyone knows what Zhao Hai is talking about. Zhao Hai is now from Hell Gate. He has many things to do now. He will go out to do a mission every few days. If he really has a mission, then he will really do it. He has no time to take care of the Gujian Gang. In this way, it is really impossible for him to take care of the situation of the Gujian Gang.

But even so, no one said that Zhao Hailai should not be the leader of the gang. Everyone just nodded and said nothing else. Then Hu Zhi said: "You guys come out of the town this time. Were there any obstacles? Didn't those of you chase you?"

Zhao Hai said in a deep voice: "Someone is looking for us tomorrow, but we were resting at that time, and we were resting at the No. 1 resting place, so the enemy did not find us. Brother, don't worry, we will rest here for two days, and then Send people back to the town to check out the situation. If we are careful, we should not be discovered by the enemy. When the enemy can no longer hold on, it will be time for us to negotiate with them."

Hu Zhi nodded and said: "Okay, let's do it like this. We have made some preparations here before. There are some food and things in it. It's okay for everyone to rest here for a while." As he spoke, After looking into the cave, Zhao Hai also looked into the cave. This was the first time he took a serious look at the cave.

This cave is an underground cave. It is very similar to the place where they rested before. There are many stalagmites here, but there are also many small caves. The most important thing is that there is water here. This makes Zhao Hai very happy. Like this A place where they can stay for a while without having to worry about anything.

But Zhao Hai quickly thought of a question. He turned to Hu Zhi and said: "Brother, besides the pool, are there any other entrances and exits here? But vents?" This is what Zhao Hai is most concerned about. If you want to live here, you need to make a fire to cook. The people in the Gujian Gang are all casual cultivators. It is impossible not to eat. If you want to cook, you will produce smoke. If there are no vents, they are afraid of being suffocated. die.

Hu Zhi smiled and said: "Don't worry, there is a vent here, and there is more than one. Let's just live here peacefully. There will definitely be no problems. Okay, let's go see everyone. Everyone is a little nervous now, and the most important thing is to appease everyone. After all, we will have to live here for a while."

Everyone responded, and then they all went to comfort everyone. Fortunately, although everyone was a little nervous and worried, there was no other reaction. They all knew very well that this time it was the four major stores that wanted to deal with them. , if they don’t leave, they will be killed by the people from the four major stores, or they will become slaves of the four major stores. The best result is just to return to their original lives, and these are beyond their ability. Accept it, they don't want to return to their original life, that is not the life they want, so no one will object to Hu Zhi's current approach.

But Zhao Hai has been paying attention to these people. He is afraid that traitors will appear among these people. If traitors appear among them, it will be troublesome. If someone exposes the location of this place, then these people will be It's over, so although Zhao Hai seems to have no reaction, he is actually monitoring everyone all the time.

Time passed little by little, and everyone's mood gradually improved. Faced with this situation, everyone breathed a sigh of relief. Hu Zhi said to Zhao Hai and the others: "Let's stay here for two days. , and then go back to the town, don’t go back openly, go back secretly, and then monitor the people in the four major stores to see how they react now, and then deal with them.”

Several people all responded, and then Hu Zhi organized everyone to start cooking. After everyone had eaten and started to rest, Zhao Hai found Hu Zhi. He gathered Hu Zhi and the others, and then said to Hu Zhi : "Brother, I think we should give those guys a hard time and let them know how powerful we are."

When Hu Zhi heard what he said, he couldn't help being stunned, and then he immediately said: "Brother, didn't you say that we can't conflict with those sects now? Why are you saying that we will give them a hard blow now? Isn't this too risky?" Hu Zhi thought that Zhao Hai was talking about taking action against the four major stores. This was not what he wanted to see. He really hadn't done a good job with the four major stores now. The store is ready for hands-on work.

Zhao Hai smiled and said: "Brother, you misunderstood. I don't want to fight with the people from the four major stores. After the people from the four major stores find out that we have left, they will definitely look for us. After they can't find us, they will definitely send people." Monitor other towns to see if we will appear. I mean, we will go directly to other towns and sell medicinal materials there. This will let the people in the four major stores know what we said before The thing is not a joke, we said we would go to other towns to sell medicinal materials, so we will go to other towns to sell medicinal materials, so that we can have the upper hand, what do you think?"

When Hu Zhi heard what Zhao Hai said, he was slightly stunned at first. Then he thought about it and then said in a deep voice: "It makes sense. If we don't do this, they will think that we can't live without them." If we go down, I'm afraid they won't give in easily. Only if we do this, they will know that we are not joking, and they will pay attention to what we say, so that when we negotiate with them, we can It will take the upper hand, okay, I think this is very good."

Zhao Hai said in a deep voice: "We just want to put more pressure on them. It's best to let them take the initiative to come to us to talk, so that we can take the initiative. Anyway, we have offended them now, so why don't we take more advantage of them?" Some are cheap, as for what happens in the future, we’ll talk about it later.”

Hu Zhi nodded and said: "Okay, let's do this. As you said, we have offended them anyway, so there is nothing more to say. If we offend them, offend them thoroughly, so as not to keep them in trouble all the time." I thought we were just joking with them, but I really want to see what the faces of the people in the four major stores are like now."
