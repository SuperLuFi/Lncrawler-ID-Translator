c7732 Puzzled

Gu Yi and Yuan Kong are good friends. This is known to everyone in the entire team, so when they saw Gu Yi following them, no one said anything. They just watched the two of them return to the room and went about their own business. Of course, there are also two or three friends who will gather together and talk about how lucky Yuan Kong is to get contribution points. .

Gu Yi and Yuan Kong arrived at Yuan Kong's room. After the two sat down, Yuan Kong said to Gu with some confusion: "Bones, what happened to the captain? Why did you suddenly ask me to study the history of the sect and its leader?" Biography? What does he mean?" Yuan Kong looked at Gu Yi with some confusion and asked. He really wanted to know what Zhang Ke wanted to do and why he was suddenly asked to do such a thing. This made him Very puzzled.

Gu Yi smiled slightly, and then said in a deep voice: "Remember, it is the history of the sect master, not the biography of the sect master. The biography of the sect master is just a short biography of the sect master, which records some of the sect master's events, but most of the things, there There is no record, but the history of the sect leader is different. There, there is a very detailed record of what the sect leader has done in the recent interfaces, as well as the history of the sect. This is something that must be learned. You are now a blood Disciples of the Killing Sect, if you don’t even know the history of the Blood Killing Sect, how can you do it? If you have time, go and learn it. Everyone of us has learned it, and the captain has also learned it recently. He feels Learning the history of the sect and the history of the sect master will be of great help to us, so we let everyone learn it, so there is nothing surprising."

Upon hearing what Gu Yi said, Yuan Kong also nodded and said: "So that's it. If you have time, you really should learn it. By the way, Bones, I got a lot of contribution points this time. , you have experience in this area, what do you think I should replace now to be the most cost-effective? I don’t have a clue yet. There are too many good things in the sect. I really don’t know what I should replace. If I really got something in exchange for something that is of no use to me, so what should I do? Please help me think about what I need most now."

Gu Yi shook his head and said: "You'd better save all your contribution points now. After you transform into your true body, you can still use the skills to enhance the ability of the Dharma. You're not very proficient in using them now, are you? You'd better be It is best to master this ability well, and it is best to use this ability of yours freely in battle, and then you can decide what to choose."

Hearing what Gu Yi said, Yuan Kong couldn't help but nodded and said: "That's true. I haven't fully mastered this ability yet. If I learn other things now, it will be more troublesome, okay, then I’ll practice this ability well first and then talk about it.”

Gu nodded and said: "Yes, that's exactly how it should be. You should practice this ability in the past few days, and at the same time, you should also learn it in the real illusion. Also, don't forget the captain's instructions. I will go back first. , I’m afraid you’ve been tortured enough by those elders these past few days, haven’t you? Take a good rest.”

Yuan Kong nodded and said: "Don't mention it, those elders kept making people transform. Now my transformation speed is much faster, but I really haven't had much rest in the past few days. Okay, then I'll go and rest first." Gu nodded, then stood up, turned around and left the room.

After Gu Yi returned to his room, he thought about what happened in the team in the past few days, and couldn't help but smile. He was very satisfied with the current situation in the team, because he knew very well that these things in the team now People are slowly becoming true disciples of the Blood Killing Sect.

Every disciple of the Blood Killing Sect must learn these things and let them understand the history of the Blood Killing Sect. Only then will they know how difficult it is for the Blood Killing Sect to get to where it is today. This will give them a sense of collective honor. Only then will they truly regard themselves as disciples of the Blood Killing Sect, and they will be truly loyal to the Blood Killing Sect in the future.

As Gu Yi said before, the disciples of the Blood Killing Sect are proud, but first, they must let those disciples know why they can be proud. This is the most important thing. Because of this, let them learn from it. The history of the Blood Killing Sect is very necessary, and this is also one of his tasks.

Gu Yi is actually a member of the intelligence department, but the intelligence department is actually divided into two parts, one is the bright department and the other is the dark department. The bright department is the departments that are on the bright side. Some high-level officials in the sect know this. Intelligence personnel, or those specialized in external intelligence such as those commanded by the boss lady, are all members of the Mingbu. However, only a very few people in the Anbu know that Furuichi is a member of the Anbu.

The ANBU of the Blood Killing Sect is actually very mysterious. There are many people who do not know the existence of the ANBU of the Blood Killing Sect at all. Even those who know it cannot know how many people there really are in the ANBU of the Blood Killing Sect. Only a few people, including Zhao Hai and Zhu Yong, knew how many people there were in the Blood Killing Sect's dark division, so no one knew Gu Yi's identity.

This time, the Blood Killing Sect has absorbed a large number of people from the Sea Clan and those from the Heavenly and Human Realm. The loyalty of these people to the Blood Killing Sect is actually very limited. It is precisely because their loyalty is very limited, so Only the Blood Killing Sect will conduct this one-year training, and the training will only make them have a better understanding of each other, let those people learn the art of battle formation, and may also increase their loyalty, but in fact it is very The limited, real backup is with Gu Yi and the others.

No one knows the identities of Gu Yi and the others, and Gu Yi and the others have only one mission, to allow those from the Hai Clan and the Celestial Realm to have time to learn the history of the Blood Killing Sect and the history of Zhao Hai. Although the history of Zhao Hai is not very complete, and the focus is on the process of establishing the Exploring Sea Sect and the Blood Killing Sect, it is enough to allow those people to truly understand the Blood Killing Sect and Zhao Hai. Hai, so that they will unconsciously develop a sense of admiration for Zhao Hai, and this is the purpose of Gu Yi and the others.

It can be seen from Zhang Ke's reaction that their plan was very successful. Zhang Ke is now becoming more and more like a disciple of the Blood Killing Sect. From now on, he will only listen to the orders of the Blood Killing Sect. Although he is still a seaman clan, but he will not put the Sea Clan in the first position, but will put the Blood Killing Sect in the first position, which is exactly what Gu Yi and the others want.

Gu Yi did not report this matter. In fact, they, the ANBU people, usually do not have any tasks. Even if something happens in their team, under normal circumstances, they will not report it. They will only report it after receiving it. When the time comes for the mission, they just have to complete the mission. If betrayal really occurs, they will report it. Otherwise, they are actually very free.

In the next two days, their team was still the same as before, training, studying, practicing, resting, and preparing for the next training. Everyone was used to this kind of life. Of course, now all of them will use it for a period of time every day. , come to learn about the history of the sect, and the temperament of their team is also changing unconsciously.

Two days later, they suddenly received a notice that tomorrow all of them would have to participate in a new round of training, and this time they would still be training jointly with other teams, and this time they would be training jointly with them. The squad is the five squads that were their enemies last time, and this time their training goal is to fight against the two squads that were with them last time, and a group composed of nine other squads. That is to say, this time they will have six squads against the enemy's eleven squads.

As soon as they received the notice, everyone was stunned. They really didn't expect such a thing, which made them very confused. However, Gu Yi understood what the sect meant, so he After knowing this, he just smiled and said nothing.

But Zhang Ke called Gu Yi into his room. Zhang Ke now discovered that it was very necessary to communicate with old disciples like Gu Yi more if something happened, because when it came to fighting against the sect As everyone knows, they can't keep up with Gu Yi and the others.

After Gu Yi arrived in his room and sat down, Zhang Ke frowned and said to Gu Yi: "Gu Yi, I don't quite understand the sect's arrangements this time. We fought so fiercely with that team last time. It can be said that both sides suffer losses. I even heard that several of their teams were punished because their losses were too heavy. Why did the sect arrange us to be on their team again this time? So that we can interact with each other. Will you cooperate?"

Gu Yi smiled and said: "Look, captain, this is what the sect is worried about, and it is also the reason why the sect does this. The sect is worried that you will have such thoughts, so it arranges us together, so In order not to be punished, we must fight together. Only in this way, we will not really form any hatred between each other. In the future, when our Blood Killing Sect fights against other forces, we can cooperate with other teams. There will not be any problems. Let us cooperate with those teams to fight. In fact, it is a process for us to understand each other and resolve the knots. In this way, we will not have any problems when we fight together in the future. Now the captain Do you understand?"

Zhang Ke is not an idiot. When he heard what Gu Yi said, he immediately understood what Gu Yi meant. He nodded and said: "I understand. Now I really understand. It turns out that the sect is actually trying to make us We will not hate each other because of what happened last time, so we are deliberately grouped together. From this point of view, we may become opponents again next time, and those two were teammates with us last time. This time it’s the opponent’s team, but next time we might become teammates with them? Is that what you mean?”

Gu Yi smiled and nodded: "Yes, that's what I mean, so in the future, you must be mentally prepared in this regard, and you must not bring the battles and emotions from the real fantasy world into reality. If it is because of this And if it affects unity, the sect may punish you."
